We adapted the launch tool to fit the study design of the papers that were included. The ROBINS-E tool was developed for studies that assess exposures and outcomes; however we only assessed different smoking status. Therefore, we deleted or reformulated items that were not applicable. Studies were marked as low risk of bias in this domain for validated surveys, biomarkers to confirm smoking behaviours and more frequent follow-ups in contrast to non-validated surveys that only rely on self-reports. All studies were evaluated and marked as either “low risk”, “some concerns”, “high risk” or “very high risk” for each domain as suggested in the guidance. Authors were contacted to clarify missing information. Incomplete information was marked as “unclear” which would negatively affect the risk of bias rating. Both reviewers compared and discussed assessments to reach a final evaluation. Moreover, studies were thoroughly assessed for any conflict of interest to identify links to the tobacco industry that may influence the reported results using a standardised approach. Studies reporting a conflict of interest were not excluded. All risk of bias and quality assessments can be viewed upon request. We applied a structured approach to assess the conflict of interest among all authors of each paper. We gave special attention to the first and last author of each paper and searched present as well as past publications to identify any links to the tobacco industry or EC manufacturers that could lead to a conflict of interest.Nine studies were evaluated as very high risk [38, 41–47, 50, 51], two as high risk [35, 40], two as some concerns [37, 39] and two as low risk [36, 52] of bias arising from measurement of exposure (table 2). Reasons for very high risk of bias in this domain were high reliance on self-reported data as the only measurement tool and long intervals between follow-ups. These measurement strategies are highly susceptible to social desirability bias, recall bias, privacy, or response bias and misunderstanding of the survey. Ultimately, self-reported data can lead to underestimation of smoking behaviour if the survey was not previously validated and a correction for bias sensitivity analysis was not conducted.

Reasons for marking studies as high-risk of bias were not reporting missing data, low percentage of retained participants, the restriction of analysis to subgroups and/or varying characteristics of participants lost to follow-up versus participants included in the analysis. For bias occurring from the selection of reported results, one study was evaluated as high risk of bias because only adjusted analyses were reported for effect measures [51]. Three studies reported their results in accordance with a predetermined analysis plan and were thus assessed as low risk of bias for this domain [39, 46, 47, 50]. The remaining 12 studies did not provide a protocol, but no differences could be found between the methods and results section leading to assessments of only some concerns [35–38, 40–45, 48, 49, 52]. One of 16 studies was directly funded by an EC manufacturer [41]. We identified two additional conflicts of interest through present or past ties to the tobacco industry [44, 46, 47].Conflict of interest: Within the past 36 months, J.B. Unger reported receiving a grant from the Food and Drug Administration Tobacco Centre Regulatory Science. R.
