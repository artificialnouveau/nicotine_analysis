Yet existing restrictions on tobacco and e-cigarette marketing are poorly implemented in most low- and middle-income countries. Ongoing challenges include weak implementation and enforcement of some aspects of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and a lack of consensus among health professionals on how to address the tobacco industry's health claims related to e-cigarettes and other novel tobacco products. We argue that, despite these challenges, countries must prioritize the implementation and enforcement of restrictions on tobacco and e-cigarette marketing as these products represent not only a serious public health threat but also a violation of children's rights.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

New concerns about pulmonary injuries associated with ENDS suggest reasons for concern about these products' health risks and potential for nicotine addiction. Nevertheless, multinational tobacco companies heavily market ENDS to retain customers with nicotine addiction, and global progress against tobacco use might slow as a result. The tobacco industry has managed to divide the tobacco control community by offering hope of harm reduction without actual evidence of ENDS' effectiveness or long-term safety. Low- and middle-income countries need this evidence to assess ENDS' value in mitigating tobacco use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of immediate vs gradual reduction in nicotine content to very low levels and as compared with usual nicotine level cigarettes on biomarkers of toxicant exposure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind, randomized, parallel-design study with 2 weeks of baseline smoking and 20 weeks of intervention was conducted at 10 US sites. A volunteer sample of daily smokers with no intention to quit within 30 days was recruited between July 2014 and September 2016, with the last follow-up completed in March 2017. INTERVENTIONS: (1) Immediate reduction to 0.4 mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco cigarettes; (2) gradual reduction from 15.5 mg to 0.4 mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco cigarettes with 5 monthly dose changes; or (3) maintenance on 15.5 mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco cigarettes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Between-group differences in 3 co-primary biomarkers of smoke toxicant exposure: breath carbon monoxide (CO), urine 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid (3-HPMA, metabolite of acrolein), and urine phenanthrene tetraol (PheT, indicator of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) calculated as area under the concentration-time curve over the 20 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: Among 1250 randomized participants (mean age, 45 years; 549 women [44%]; 958 [77%] completed the trial), significantly lower levels of exposure were observed in the immediate vs gradual reduction group for CO (mean difference, -4.06 parts per million [ppm] [95% CI, -4.89 to -3.23]; P < .0055), 3-HPMA (ratio of geometric means, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.77 to 0.88]; P < .0055), and PheT (ratio of geometric means, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.83 to 0.93]; P < .0055). Significantly lower levels of exposure were observed in the immediate reduction vs control group for CO (mean difference, -3.38 [95% CI, -4.40 to -2.36]; P < .0055), 3-HPMA (ratio of geometric means, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.88]; P < .0055), and PheT (ratio of geometric means, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.81 to 0.92]; P < .0055). No significant differences were observed between the gradual reduction vs control groups for CO (mean difference, 0.68 [95% CI, -0.31 to 1.67]; P = .18), 3-HPMA (ratio of geometric means, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.06]; P = .64), and PheT (ratio of geometric means, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.04]; P = .52). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among smokers, immediate reduction of nicotine in cigarettes led to significantly greater decreases in biomarkers of smoke exposure across time compared with gradual reduction or a control group, with no significant differences between gradual reduction and control.

Although not licensed in the US, cytisinicline is used in some European countries to aid smoking cessation, but its traditional dosing regimen and treatment duration may not be optimal. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of cytisinicline for smoking cessation when administered in a novel pharmacokinetically based dosing regimen for 6 or 12 weeks vs placebo. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 3-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial (ORCA-2) compared 2 durations of cytisinicline treatment (6 or 12 weeks) vs placebo, with follow-up to 24 weeks, among 810 adults who smoked cigarettes daily and wanted to quit. It was conducted at 17 US sites from October 2020 to December 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to cytisinicline, 3 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks (n = 270); cytisinicline, 3 mg, 3 times daily for 6 weeks then placebo 3 times daily for 6 weeks (n = 269); or placebo 3 times daily for 12 weeks (n = 271). All participants received behavioral support. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Biochemically verified continuous smoking abstinence for the last 4 weeks of cytisinicline treatment vs placebo (primary) and from end of treatment to 24 weeks (secondary). RESULTS: Of 810 randomized participants (mean age, 52.5 years; 54.6% female; mean of 19.4 cigarettes smoked daily), 618 (76.3%) completed the trial. For the 6-week course of cytisinicline vs placebo, continuous abstinence rates were 25.3% vs 4.4% during weeks 3 to 6 (odds ratio [OR], 8.0 [95% CI, 3.9-16.3]; P < .001) and 8.9% vs 2.6% during weeks 3 to 24 (OR, 3.7 [95% CI, 1.5-10.2]; P = .002). For the 12-week course of cytisinicline vs placebo, continuous abstinence rates were 32.6% vs 7.0% for weeks 9 to 12 (OR, 6.3 [95% CI, 3.7-11.6]; P < .001) and 21.1% vs 4.8% during weeks 9 to 24 (OR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.8-11.1]; P < .001). Nausea, abnormal dreams, and insomnia occurred in less than 10% of each group. Sixteen participants (2.9%) discontinued cytisinicline due to an adverse event. No drug-related serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Both 6- and 12-week cytisinicline schedules, with behavioral support, demonstrated smoking cessation efficacy and excellent tolerability, offering new nicotine dependence treatment options.

The Brown and Williamson documents.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the tobacco industry's public and private responses to rising concern over the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). DATA SOURCES: Documents from Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation (B&W), the British American Tobacco Company (BAT), and other tobacco interests provided by an anonymous source, obtained from Congress, and received from the private papers of a former BAT officer. STUDY SELECTION: All available materials, including confidential reports regarding research and internal memoranda exchanged between tobacco industry lawyers. CONCLUSIONS: Privately, B&W and BAT began conducting research related to ETS in the mid 1970s. BAT researchers appear to have determined that sidestream smoke produces irritation, that it contains toxic substances including N-nitrosamines, and that it is ""biologically active"" (eg, carcinogenic) in laboratory tests. During the 1980s, the primary purpose of BAT's research related to ETS was to develop a new cigarette that emitted less irritating and less biologically active sidestream smoke. Publicly, the tobacco industry has denied that exposure to ETS has been proven dangerous to health. It has criticized the methodology of published research on ETS, even when some of its own consultants have privately acknowledged that the research was valid. In addition, the industry has funded scientific research with the stated purpose of anticipating and refuting the evidence against ETS. The tobacco industry's strategy regarding passive smoking has been remarkably similar to its strategy regarding active smoking. It has privately conducted internal research, at least some of which has supported the conclusion that passive smoking is dangerous to health, while it has publicly denied that the hazards have been proven.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Historical, social, and constitutional perspectives.","Perspectives on tobacco control in American society have shifted markedly. As the view that smoking as a voluntarily assumed health risk has declined, the social and political environment has become more conducive to industry regulation. This transformation can be traced to the mounting evidence of the health risks of secondary smoke; the addictive quality of nicotine; the vulnerability and exploitation of young people; and industry knowledge of the harmful effects of tobacco. Regulation of tobacco advertising and promotions by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raises serious concerns about constitutional protection for commercial speech. However, the minimal informational value of tobacco advertising suggests that it should be afforded a low level of constitutional protection. The FDA regulations impose reasonable ""time, place, and manner"" restrictions, leave open alternative channels of communication, restrict messages that are harmful to the public health, do not restrict political speech, prevent misleading messages, and help deter the unlawful sale of tobacco products to minors. The regulations meet the traditional criteria for regulating commercial speech, in that the government's asserted interest is strong, the agency's regulations directly advance that interest, and the regulations are no more extensive than necessary. Thus, the judiciary should defend the FDA's historical social and legislative mission to protect the public health.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

This trial is now history, but its legacy will carry on into the 21st century because of the revelations contained in the millions of pages of previously secret internal tobacco industry documents made public in the trial. In this article, we review representative documents relating to nicotine addiction, low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes, and cigarette design and nicotine manipulation in cigarette manufacture. These documents reveal that for decades, the industry knew and internally acknowledged that nicotine is an addictive drug and cigarettes are the ultimate nicotine delivery device; that nicotine addiction can be perpetuated and even enhanced through cigarette design alterations and manipulations; and that ""health-conscious"" smokers could be captured by low-tar, low-nicotine products, all the while ensuring the marketplace viability of their products. Appreciation of tobacco industry strategies over the past decades is essential to formulate an appropriate legislative and public policy response. We propose key elements for such legislation and urge no legal or financial immunity for the tobacco industry.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Cigarette smoking has been described among college students, but little is known about non-cigarette tobacco use by college students or cigar use by adults of any age. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of all forms of tobacco use (cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and smokeless tobacco) among US college students and to identify student- and college-level factors associated with use of each product. DESIGN: The Harvard College Alcohol Survey, a self-administered survey conducted in 1999. SETTING: One hundred nineteen nationally representative US 4-year colleges. SUBJECTS: A total of 14,138 randomly selected students (60% response rate). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-report of current (in the past 30 days), past-year, and lifetime use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco, and all tobacco products. RESULTS: Nearly half (45.7%) of respondents had used a tobacco product in the past year and one third (32.9%) currently used tobacco. Cigarettes accounted for most of the tobacco use (28.5% current prevalence), but cigar use was also substantial (37.1% lifetime prevalence, 23.0% past-year prevalence, and 8.5% current prevalence) and combinations of the 2 were common. Total tobacco use was higher in men than in women (37. 9% vs 29.7%; P<.001), despite nearly identical current cigarette smoking rates between the sexes (28.5% for women vs 28.4% for men), because of greater use of cigars (current prevalence, 15.7% vs 3.9%; P<.001) and smokeless tobacco (current prevalence, 8.7% vs 0.4%; P<. 001) by men. Tobacco use was significantly higher among white students (P<.001), users of other substances (alcohol and marijuana) (P<.001), and students whose priorities were social rather than educational or athletic (P<.05). Among students who had used both cigars and cigarettes, only 8.9% smoked cigars at an earlier age than they had smoked cigarettes. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that tobacco use is common among college students and is not limited to cigarettes. College appears to be a time when many students are trying a range of tobacco products and are in danger of developing lifelong nicotine dependence. National efforts to monitor and reduce tobacco use of all types should expand to focus on college students and other young adults.

State-of-the-science reports were presented and 120 attendees (representing government and private agencies, academia, health educators, and tobacco control experts) participated in panels and summary development discussions. The following conclusions were reached by consensus: (1) rates of cigar smoking are rising among both adults and adolescents; (2) smoking cigars instead of cigarettes does not reduce the risk of nicotine addiction; (3) as the number of cigars smoked and the amount of smoke inhaled increases, the risk of death related to cigar smoking approaches that of cigarette smoking; (4) cigar smoke contains higher concentrations of toxic and carcinogenic compounds than cigarettes and is a major source of fine-particle and carbon monoxide indoor air pollution; and (5) cigar smoking is known to cause cancers of the lung and upper aerodigestive tract.

In controlled clinical trials, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and the antidepressant bupropion have been shown to significantly increase cessation rates only for moderate to heavy smokers (> or = 15 cigarettes/d). Nicotine replacement therapy is heavily promoted to the general population by both the pharmaceutical industry and tobacco control advocates. OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in smoking cessation, pharmaceutical cessation aid use, and success in cessation in the general California population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The large population-based California Tobacco Surveys of 1992, 1996, and 1999, including 5247 (71.3% response rate), 9725 (72.9% response rate), and 6412 (68.4% response rate) respondents, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of cessation attempts (> or = 1 day) among smokers in the last year, use of pharmaceutical aids (mostly over-the-counter products since 1996), and cessation success. RESULTS: Between 1992 and 1999, cessation attempts among California smokers increased 61.4% (from 38.1% to 61.5%), and NRT use among quitters increased 50.5% (from 9.3% to 14.0%). A total of 17.2% of quitters used NRT, an antidepressant, or both as an aid to cessation in 1999. In 1996 and 1999, the median duration of aid use (14 days) was much less than recommended, and only about 20% of users had adjuvant one-on-one or group behavioral counseling. Use of NRT increased short-term cessation success in moderate to heavy smokers in each survey year. However, a long-term cessation advantage was only observed before NRT became widely available over-the-counter (August 1996). In 1999, no advantage for pharmaceutical aid users was observed in either the short or long term for the nearly 60% of California smokers classified as light smokers (<15 cigarettes/d). CONCLUSION: Since becoming available over the counter, NRT appears no longer effective in increasing long-term successful cessation in California smokers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

In our investigation of tobacco company documents released and posted on the Internet as a result of the Master Settlement Agreement, we have found that these financial ties have fostered both competition and collaboration between the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries. We present 3 case studies. One shows how tobacco companies pressured pharmaceutical companies to scale back their smoking cessation educational materials that accompanied Nicorette. The second shows how they restricted to whom the pharmaceutical company could market its transdermal nicotine patch. In the third case, we show how subsidiary tobacco and pharmaceutical companies of a parent company collaborated in the production of a nicotine-release gum. Thus, because tobacco cessation product marketing has been altered as a result of these financial conflicts, disclosure would serve the interest of public health.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative cardiovascular safety risk of smoking cessation treatments. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind, randomized, triple-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled trial (Evaluating Adverse Events in a Global Smoking Cessation Study [EAGLES]) and its nontreatment extension trial was conducted at 140 multinational centers. Smokers, with or without established psychiatric diagnoses, who received at least 1 dose of study medication (n = 8058), as well as a subset of those who completed 12 weeks of treatment plus 12 weeks of follow up and agreed to be followed up for an additional 28 weeks (n = 4595), were included. INTERVENTIONS: Varenicline, 1 mg twice daily; bupropion hydrochloride, 150 mg twice daily; and nicotine replacement therapy, 21-mg/d patch with tapering. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the time to development of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE: cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) during treatment; secondary end points were the occurrence of MACE and other pertinent cardiovascular events (MACE+: MACE or new-onset or worsening peripheral vascular disease requiring intervention, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina). RESULTS: Of the 8058 participants, 3553 (44.1%) were male (mean [SD] age, 46.5 [12.3] years). The incidence of cardiovascular events during treatment and follow-up was low (<0.5% for MACE; <0.8% for MACE+) and did not differ significantly by treatment. No significant treatment differences were observed in time to cardiovascular events, blood pressure, or heart rate. There was no significant difference in time to onset of MACE for either varenicline or bupropion treatment vs placebo (varenicline: hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.05-1.68 and bupropion: hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.10-2.50). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: No evidence that the use of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies increased the risk of serious cardiovascular adverse events during or after treatment was observed. The findings of EAGLES and its extension trial provide further evidence that smoking cessation medications do not increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events in the general population of smokers.

Many would like to quit vaping nicotine but are unable to do so. Cytisinicline, a plant-based alkaloid, targets nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, reduces nicotine dependence, and helps adults to stop smoking cigarettes. Cytisinicline may also help e-cigarette users to quit vaping. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of cytisinicline vs placebo to produce abstinence from e-cigarette use in adults seeking to quit vaping nicotine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial compared 12 weeks of treatment with cytisinicline vs placebo, with follow-up to 16 weeks. It was conducted from July 2022 to February 2023 across 5 US clinical trial sites. A total of 160 adults who vaped nicotine daily, sought to quit, and did not currently smoke cigarettes were enrolled, and 131 (81.9%) completed the trial. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized (2:1) to cytisinicline, 3 mg, taken 3 times daily (n = 107) or placebo (n = 53) for 12 weeks. All participants received weekly behavioral support. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Biochemically verified continuous e-cigarette abstinence during the last 4 weeks of treatment (weeks 9-12; primary outcome) and through 4 weeks posttreatment (weeks 9-16; secondary outcome). Missing outcomes were counted as nonabstinence. RESULTS: Of 160 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 33.6 [11.1] years; 83 [51.9%] female), 115 (71.9%) formerly smoked (≥100 lifetime cigarettes). Continuous e-cigarette abstinence in cytisinicline and placebo groups occurred in 34 of 107 participants (31.8%) vs 8 of 53 participants (15.1%) (odds ratio, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.06-7.10; P = .04) at end of treatment (weeks 9-12) and in 25 of 107 participants (23.4%) vs 7 of 53 participants (13.2%) during weeks 9 to 16 (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.82-5.32; P = .15). There was no evidence, based on nonsignificant interactions, that cytisinicline efficacy differed in subgroups defined by demographic characteristics, vaping pattern, e-cigarette dependence, or smoking history. Cytisinicline was well tolerated, with 4 participants (3.8%) discontinuing cytisinicline due to an adverse event. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, cytisinicline for 12 weeks, with behavioral support, demonstrated efficacy for cessation of e-cigarette use at end of treatment and was well tolerated by adults, offering a potential pharmacotherapy option for treating nicotine e-cigarette use in adults who seek to quit vaping.

Cytisinicline, a partial agonist at α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, has demonstrated smoking cessation efficacy in 1 US trial. Additional evidence is needed. OBJECTIVE: To reproduce the findings of the efficacy and tolerability of cytisinicline compared with placebo for smoking cessation and to test its effect on nicotine craving as a mechanism of action. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a 3-group double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 replication randomized clinical trial (ORCA-3) conducted at 20 clinical trial sites in the US from January 2022 to March 2023. It compared 6 and 12 weeks of a novel cytisinicline regimen to placebo among adults who smoked 10 or more cigarettes daily and sought to quit. Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to 3-mg cytisinicline 3 times daily for 12 weeks; 3-mg cytisinicline 3 times daily for 6 weeks followed by placebo for 6 weeks; or placebo 3 times daily for 12 weeks. The follow-up period was 24 weeks, and all groups received behavioral support. Data analyses were performed from May 3, 2023, to March 20, 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Cytisinicline, 3 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks; cytisinicline, 3 mg, 3 times daily for 6 weeks followed by placebo for 6 weeks; or placebo 3 times daily for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Biochemically verified (carbon monoxide <10 ppm) continuous smoking abstinence during the last 4 weeks of 6- and 12-week treatments (primary outcome) and from end of treatment to 24 weeks (secondary outcome); Questionnaire of Smoking Urges; incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: Of 792 participants randomized (mean [SD] age, 52.0 [11.8] years; 439 [55.4%] female; mean [SD] cigarettes/d, 20.4 [7.5]), 628 (79.3%) completed the trial. Primary and secondary outcomes were significantly higher for both cytisinicline groups vs placebo. For 6-week treatment, 39 cytisinicline participants (14.8%) vs 16 placebo participants (6.0%) were abstinent during weeks 3 to 6 (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.6; P < .001). For 12-week treatment, 80 cytisinicline participants (30.3%) vs 25 placebo participants (9.4%) were abstinent during weeks 9 to 12 (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.6-7.3; P < .001). Continuous abstinence rates for the 6-week treatment were 6.8% (cytisinicline) vs 1.1% (placebo) from weeks 3 to 24 . Continuous abstinence rates for the 12-week treatment were 20.5% (cytisinicline) vs 4.2% (placebo) for weeks 9 to 24. Reduction in craving at week 6 was greater for cytisinicline than placebo (-15.2 points [95% CI, -16.4 to -14.0] vs -12.0 points [95% CI, -13.5 to -10.5]; P < .001). Cytisinicline was well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of the ORCA phase 3 trial reaffirms the efficacy and tolerability of cytisinicline at both 6- and 12-week treatment for smoking cessation, with benefits extending through 24 weeks. As a mechanism of effect, cytisinicline mitigated nicotine craving.

Fast nicotine metabolizers may be at risk for increased smoking following a national nicotine reduction policy. We hypothesized that using reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes would be associated with increases in smoking behaviors and exposure among smokers with a fast-but not slow-nicotine-metabolite ratio (NMR). OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of RNC cigarettes with smoking behaviors and biomarkers of exposure and to compare these associations in fast and slow metabolizers of nicotine based on the NMR. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A 35-day, 3-period, within-participant nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted at an academic medical center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A 5-day baseline period using the smokers' preferred brand of cigarettes was followed by 2 consecutive 15-day periods using free investigational RNC cigarettes. A total of 100 daily, non-treatment-seeking, nonmenthol cigarette smokers (59 fast, 41 slow metabolizers) were recruited from December 24, 2013, to December 2, 2015. Data analysis was performed from December 12, 2016, to January 3, 2018. INTERVENTIONS: Two 15-day periods using cigarettes containing 5.2 mg (RNC1) and 1.3 mg (RNC2) of nicotine per gram of tobacco. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Smoking behaviors (number of cigarettes per day [CPD], total puff volume) and biomarkers of exposure (carbon monoxide [CO], urine total nicotine equivalents [TNE], and 4-[methylnitrosamino]-1-[3-pyridyl]-1-butanol [NNAL]). RESULTS: Smokers (73 [73.0%] men; 74 [74.0%] white; mean [SD] age, 43.02 [12.13] years; mean [SD] CPD, 17.31 [5.72]) consumed 2.62 (95% CI, 1.54-3.70) more CPD during the RNC1 period vs their preferred brand during baseline (P < .001) and approximated baseline CPD during the RNC2 period (mean difference, 0.96 [95% CI, -0.36 to 2.28]; P = .24). Additional outcome measures were lower during both RNC periods vs baseline (total puff volume, mean [95% CI]: RNC1, 537 mL [95% CI, 479-595 mL]; RNC2, 598 mL [95% CI, 547-649 mL] vs baseline, 744 mL [95% CI, 681-806 mL]; TNE, mean [95% CI]: RNC1, 30.9 nmoL/mg creatinine [95% CI, 26.0-36.6 nmoL/mg]; RNC2, 22.8 nmoL/mg creatinine [95% CI, 17.8-29.0 nmoL/mg] vs baseline, 54.6 nmoL/mg creatinine [95% CI, 48.1-62.1 nmoL/mg]; and NNAL, mean [95% CI]: RNC1, 229 pg/mg creatinine [95% CI, 189-277 pg/mg]; RNC2, 190 pg/mg creatinine [95% CI, 157-231 pg/mg] vs baseline, 280 pg/mg creatinine [95% CI, 231-339 pg/mg]; all P < .001). Carbon monoxide measures were similar across study periods (CO boost [SD], RNC1, 4.6 ppm [4.1-5.1 ppm]; RNC2, 4.2 ppm [3.7-4.6 ppm]; and baseline, 4.4 ppm [3.8-4.9 ppm]). The RNC cigarette associations did not differ by NMR. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Both RNC cigarettes were associated with decreased puffing and urinary biomarker exposure but not with decreased daily cigarette consumption or CO levels. The NMR did not moderate associations at the nicotine levels tested, suggesting that fast metabolizers may not be at greater risk of increasing use or exposure from these products should the FDA mandate an RNC standard for cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

OBJECTIVE: To build an evidence base for perceptions of risk from and use of pod-based e-cigarettes among adolescents and young adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a survey study, a cross-sectional analysis was performed of data collected from April 6 to June 20, 2018, from 445 California adolescents and young adults as part of an ongoing prospective cohort study designed to measure the use and perceptions of tobacco products. EXPOSURES: Use of pod-based e-cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and cigarettes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Ever use, past 7-day use, and past 30-day use and co-use of pod-based e-cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and cigarettes; use of flavors and nicotine in pod-based e-cigarettes and e-cigarettes; and associated perceptions of risks, benefits, and nicotine dependence. RESULTS: Among 445 adolescents and young adults (280 females, 140 males, 6 transgender individuals, and 19 missing data; mean [SD] age, 19.3 [1.7] years) who completed wave 6 of the ongoing prospective cohort study, ever use information was provided by 437 respondents, of which 68 (15.6%) reported use of pod-based e-cigarettes, 133 (30.4%) reported use of e-cigarettes, and 106 (24.3%) reported use of cigarettes. The mean (SD) number of days that pod-based e-cigarettes were used in the past 7 days was 1.5 (2.4) and in the past 30 days was 6.7 (10.0). The mean (SD) number of days that other e-cigarettes were used in the past 7 days was 0.8 (1.8) and in the past 30 days was 3.2 (7.4). The mean (SD) number of days that cigarettes were used in the past 7 days was 0.7 (1.8) and in the past 30 days was 3.0 (7.6). Among ever users of pod-based e-cigarettes, 18 (26.5%) reported their first e-liquid was flavored menthol or mint and 19 (27.9%) reported fruit (vs 13 [9.8%] and 50 [37.6%] for other e-cigarettes). The mean perceived chance of experiencing social risks and short-term and long-term health risks from the use of either pod-based e-cigarettes or other e-cigarettes was 40% and did not differ statistically by e-cigarette type. Among 34 adolescents and young adults reporting any loss of autonomy from nicotine, there was no difference in mean (SD) Hooked On Nicotine Checklist scores between those using pod-based e-cigarettes (2.59 [3.14]) and other e-cigarettes (2.32 [2.55]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use by adolescents and young adults of newer types of e-cigarettes such as pod-based systems is increasing rapidly, and adolescents and young adults report corresponding misperceptions and lack of knowledge about these products. Rapid innovation by e-cigarette manufacturers suggests that public health and prevention efforts appear to be needed to include messages targeting components common to all current and emerging e-cigarette products to increase knowledge and decrease misperceptions, with the goal to try to ultimately reduce e-cigarette use among adolescents and young adults.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

OBJECTIVE: To examine among youth (aged 12-17 years), young adults (aged 18-24 years), and adults (aged ≥25 years) the prevalence of first use of flavored tobacco products among new tobacco users and the association between first flavored use of a given tobacco product and tobacco use 1 year later, including progression of tobacco use. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study represents a longitudinal analysis of data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a nationally representative study with data collected in 2013 to 2014 (wave 1) and 2014 to 2015 (wave 2). Participants were noninstitutionalized individuals, including 11 996 youth and 26 447 adults, in selected households who participated in both waves of the PATH Study. Data analysis was conducted from July 2016 to June 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of tobacco product use at wave 2. RESULTS: The mean (SE) age of the participants was 14.5 (0.0) years for youth, 21.1 (0.0) years for young adults, and 50.3 (0.0) for adults. Most youth (71.9%; 95% CI, 69.7%-74.0%) and young adults (57.6%; 95% CI, 54.9%-60.3%) who were new users of tobacco products over the 10- to 13-month follow-up period used flavored products.

Given this prevalence and that young adulthood is a critical period for the establishment of tobacco and nicotine use, it is important to consider the association between ENDS use and cigarette smoking specifically in this age group. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether ENDS use frequency or intensity is associated with changes in cigarette smoking among US YA ever smokers during 1 year. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used 3 waves of data (2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016) from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of adults and youth. Unweighted 1:6 propensity score matching was used to match participants on wave 1 risk factors for ENDS use at wave 2. The changes in smoking between wave 2 and wave 3 were assessed using the matched sample. In total, 1096 ENDS-naive, ever cigarette-smoking YAs (18-24 years of age) at wave 1 who participated in wave 2 and wave 3 and who had complete data in the PATH Study were included in the analyses, which were conducted from August 2018 to October 2019. EXPOSURES: Never ENDS use (n = 987), any previous 30-day ENDS use (n = 109), 1 to 5 days of ENDS use in the previous 30 days (n = 75), and 6 or more days ENDS use in the previous 30 days at wave 2 (n = 34). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The analytic sample was selected using multiple variables based on peer-reviewed literature supporting associations with ENDS use. The main outcomes-changes in cigarette smoking behavior between wave 2 and wave 3-were defined using 2 measures: (1) change in smoking frequency, defined as the number of smoking days in the previous 30 days at wave 3 vs wave 2, and (2) change in smoking intensity, defined as the number smoking days in the previous 30 days multiplied by the mean number of cigarettes consumed on smoking days at wave 3 vs wave 2. RESULTS: The present cohort analyses included 1096 YA ever smokers who were ENDS naive at wave 1. The majority of the sample were women (609 [55.6%]) and White individuals (698 [63.7%]), and the mean (SD) age was 21.4 (1.9) years. In wave 1, 161 YAs (14.7%) were daily smokers in the previous 30 days. After propensity score matching, no statistically significant associations were observed between any definition of wave 2 ENDS use and changes in either the frequency or intensity of smoking at wave 3. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of US YA ever smokers, ENDS use was not associated with either decreased or increased cigarette smoking during a 1-year period. However, it is possible that the rapidly evolving marketplace of vaping products may lead to different trajectories of YA cigarette and ENDS use in the future.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

They contain high nicotine concentrations, which may facilitate switching among smokers, but could also lead to increased exposure to nicotine and biomarkers of potential harm. African American and Latinx smokers experience significant tobacco-related health disparities. The potential of NSPS e-cigarettes to reduce smoking-related harm among these groups is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the harm reduction potential of NSPS e-cigarette vs combustible cigarettes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This unblinded randomized clinical trial compared 6 weeks of e-cigarette use vs cigarettes as usual from to 2018 to 2019 among smokers in the San Diego, California, and Kansas City, Missouri, areas. Participants included African American and Latinx adult combustible cigarette smokers who smoked at least 5 cigarettes/d on at least 25 of the past 30 days for at least 6 months and were interested in switching to e-cigarettes. Data were analyzed from September 18, 2019, to September 4, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: 6 weeks of e-cigarette use in a choice of pod flavors (5% nicotine) along with brief education, training, and action planning to completely switch to e-cigarettes from combustible cigarettes. The control group smoked combustible cigarettes as usual. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was reduction in urinary 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) concentration at week 6. Secondary outcomes were change in urinary cotinine, expired carbon monoxide (CO), respiratory symptoms, lung function, blood pressure, past 7-day consumption of combustible cigarettes, and switching rates (e-cigarette group only) at weeks 2 and 6. RESULTS: This study included 186 participants, including 92 African American participants and 94 Latinx participants. The mean (SD) age was 43.3 (12.5) years, and 75 (40.3%) were women. Participants smoked a mean (SD) of 12.1 (7.2) cigarettes/d on 6.8 (0.6) d/wk at baseline. A total of 125 participants were randomized to the e-cigarette group and 61 were randomized to the control group. At baseline, median (interquartile range) NNAL was 124 (45-197) pg/mL in the e-cigarette group and 88 (58-197) pg/mL in the control group. At week 6, the e-cigarette group had significantly greater reductions in NNAL (relative risk [RR], 0.36 [95% CI, 0.23-0.54]; P < .001), CO (RR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.42-0.68]; P < .001), respiratory symptoms (RR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.47-0.85]; P = .002), and number of cigarettes smoked in the past 7 days among those still smoking (RR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.20-0.43]; P < .001) than the control group and maintained their cotinine levels (RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.58-1.10]; P = .17). Lung function and diastolic and systolic blood pressure remained unchanged and did not differ between groups. For participants randomized to receive e-cigarettes, 32 participants (28.1%) were exclusively using e-cigarettes at week 6, while 66 participants (57.9%) were dual using and 16 participants (14%) resumed exclusively using cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that e-cigarettes may be an inclusive harm reduction strategy for African American and Latinx smokers.

OBJECTIVE: To compare pharmacotherapy efficacy and examine variables to explain Black vs White differences in smoking abstinence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study is a secondary analysis of the Evaluating Adverse Events in a Global Smoking Cessation Study (EAGLES) double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, which took place at clinical trial centers, academic centers, and outpatient clinics in 29 states in the US. US Black and White smokers who smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day with and without psychiatric comorbidity were enrolled between November 2011 and January 2015. Data analysis was performed from July 2019 to January 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) in a double-blind, triple-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled (nicotine patch) trial of varenicline and bupropion for 12 weeks with follow-up through week 24. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Biochemically verified continuous cigarette abstinence rate (CAR) from weeks 9 to 24. Baseline, postbaseline treatment, and safety characteristics were examined as variables to explain race differences in abstinence. RESULTS: Of the 1065 Black smokers enrolled, 255 were randomized to receive varenicline, 259 received bupropion, 286 received nicotine replacement therapy (NRT [ie, nicotine patch]), and 265 received placebo. Among the 3044 White smokers enrolled, 778 were randomized to receive varenicline, 769 received bupropion, 738 received NRT, and 759 received placebo. Participants were predominantly female (614 Black [57.7%] and 1786 White [58.7%] women) and heavy smokers (mean [SD] cigarettes per day, 18.2 [7.9] for Black and 20.0 [7.5] for White smokers), with a mean (SD) age of 47.2 (11.2) years for Black and 46.5 (12.7) years for White participants. Treatment and race were associated with CAR for weeks 9 to 24. The CAR was 4.9% lower for Black vs White participants (odds ratio [OR], 0.53; 95% CI, 0.41-0.69; P < .001); differences were found across all treatments. Pooling psychiatric and nonpsychiatric cohorts, varenicline (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.90-3.63; P < .001), bupropion (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.25-2.46; P = .001), and NRT (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.07-2.16; P = .02) had greater efficacy than placebo for White participants. Only varenicline (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.26-5.48; P = .01) had greater efficacy than placebo for Black participants. Baseline, postbaseline, and safety characteristics differed by race, but these variables did not eliminate the association of race with CAR. Black participants had 49% reduced odds of CAR for weeks 9 to 24 compared with White participants in the adjusted model (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.39-0.66; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Black and White smokers achieved the highest rate of abstinence while taking varenicline, suggesting that it is the best first-line therapy for these groups. However, Black smokers were less responsive to all therapies, including placebo.

Few studies have addressed how FDA media campaigns can effectively communicate about cigarette smoke constituents. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether messages about cigarette smoke constituents are effective in reducing smoking intentions and behaviors among adults who smoke. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial enrolled participants who were aged between 18 and 65 years, were English speakers, were living in the United States, and who smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and now smoked every day or some days. Participants received daily messages via email for 15 days. Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 message conditions or a control group and reported their previous-day smoking behaviors daily. Follow-up surveys were conducted on days 16 and 32. Data were collected from June 2017 to April 2018 and analyzed from April to September 2018. INTERVENTIONS: The 3 groups were (1) constituent plus engagement messages (eg, ""Cigarette smoke contains arsenic. This causes heart damage."") that included the FDA as the source and engagement text (eg, ""Within 3 months of quitting, your heart and lungs work better. Ready to be tobacco free? You can quit. For free nicotine replacement, call 1-800-QUIT-NOW""); (2) constituent-only messages that did not list the FDA as the source or include engagement text; and (3) a control condition with messages about littering cigarette butts. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in quit intentions (range, 1-4, with higher scores indicating stronger intentions) from pretest to day 16. Secondary outcome measures included daily smoking behaviors and quit attempts. RESULTS: A total of 789 participants (mean [SD] age, 43.4 [12.9] years; 483 [61.2%] women; 578 [73.3%] White; 717 [90.9%] non-Hispanic) were included in the study. The mean (SD) quit intention score was 2.5 (0.9) at pretest. Mean (SE) change in quit intention score from pretest to day 16 was 0.19 (0.07) points higher in the constituent plus engagement condition than in the control condition (P = .005) and 0.23 (0.07) points higher in the constituent-only condition compared with the control condition (P = .001). Participant reports of cigarettes smoked, forgone, and butted out were similar across study conditions at baseline and did not differ significantly at days 16 and 32 across study conditions. Viewing more messages was associated with an estimated decrease of 0.15 (SE, 0.01) cigarettes smoked per day per message viewed overall across conditions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal test of cigarette constituent campaign messages in a national sample of adults who currently smoke. Messages about cigarette smoke constituents, with or without engagement text and source information, increased participants' intentions to quit, lending support to FDA efforts to educate consumers about such constituents.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether e-cigarette use is associated with discontinuing cigarette smoking among smokers who were initially never planning to quit. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used US nationally representative data from the longitudinal Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study (waves 2-5 conducted between October 2014 and November 2019), with participants evaluated in 3 pairs of interviews. Adult daily cigarette smokers initially not using e-cigarettes and with no plans to ever quit smoking for good (2489 observations from 1600 individuals) were included. EXPOSURES: e-Cigarette use (ie, daily use, nondaily use, or no use) at follow-up interview among smokers not using e-cigarettes at baseline interview. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were discontinuation of cigarette smoking (ie, no cigarette smoking) and discontinuation of daily cigarette smoking (ie, no daily cigarette smoking) at follow-up interview. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the association between the exposure and each outcome, controlling for demographic characteristics and cigarettes smoked per day at baseline interview; all estimates were weighted. RESULTS: The weighted population of adult daily cigarette smokers who were not using e-cigarettes and had no plans to ever quit smoking, based on data from 1600 participants, was 56.1% male (95% CI, 53.4%-58.7%), 10.1% Hispanic (95% CI, 8.2%-12.3%), 10.1% non-Hispanic Black (95% CI, 8.7%-11.7%), 75.6% non-Hispanic White (95% CI, 72.9%-78.2%), and 4.2% of other non-Hispanic race (95% CI, 3.3%-5.4%); 29.3% were aged 55 to 69 years (95% CI, 26.2%-32.6%), 8.9% were aged 70 years or older (95% CI, 6.8%-11.5%), 36.8% did not graduate from high school (95% CI, 34.1%-39.6%), 55.2% had an annual household income of less than $25 000 (95% CI, 52.3%-58.1%), 37.6% smoked 20 to 29 cigarettes per day (95% CI, 34.7%-40.6%), and 12.7% smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day (95% CI, 10.9%-14.7%). Overall, 6.2% of the population (95% CI, 5.0%-7.5%) discontinued cigarette smoking. Discontinuation rates were higher among those who used e-cigarettes daily (28.0%; 95% CI, 15.2%-45.9%) compared with not at all (5.8%; 95% CI, 4.7%-7.2%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.11; 95% CI, 3.14-20.97). Furthermore, 10.7% (95% CI, 9.1%-12.5%) discontinued daily cigarette smoking, with higher rates of discontinuation observed among those who used e-cigarettes daily (45.5%; 95% CI, 27.4%-64.9%) compared with not at all (9.9%; 95% CI, 8.2%-11.8%; aOR, 9.67; 95% CI, 4.02-23.25). Nondaily e-cigarette use was not associated with cigarette discontinuation (aOR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.08-3.35) or daily cigarette discontinuation (aOR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.44-2.09). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, daily e-cigarette use was associated with greater odds of cigarette discontinuation among smokers who initially had no plans to ever quit smoking. These findings support the consideration of smokers who are not planning to quit when evaluating the risk-benefit potential of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation in the population.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

OBJECTIVES: To examine changes in urinary biomarkers between baseline and 1-year follow-up among adult tobacco users switching between e-cigarettes and cigarettes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from wave 1 (baseline, September 2013 to December 2014) and wave 2 (1-year follow-up, October 2014 to October 2015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study. A subset of the probability sample of US adults who voluntarily provided biospecimens at 2 waves was analyzed. Participants were divided into 3 mutually exclusive groups at baseline: exclusive cigarette smokers, exclusive e-cigarette users, and dual users. Data analysis was performed in 2021. EXPOSURES: Harmful and potentially harmful constituents included nicotine metabolites, tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs; including 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol [NNAL]), metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Within-participant changes in 55 urinary biomarkers of exposure (BOEs) to harmful and potentially harmful constituents were examined using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: Among 3211 participants (55.6% women, 68.3% White, 13.2% Black, and 11.8% Hispanic) at baseline, 21.9% of exclusive cigarette users, 42.8% of exclusive e-cigarette users, and 62.1% of dual users changed product use at follow-up (all percentages are weighted). There was a significant reduction in urine concentrations of TSNAs, PAHs, and VOCs when users transitioned from exclusive cigarette to exclusive e-cigarette use, with a 92% decrease in NNAL, from a mean of 168.4 pg/mg creatinine (95% CI, 102.3-277.1 pg/mg creatinine) to 12.9 pg/mg creatinine (95% CI, 6.4-25.7 pg/mg creatinine; P < .001). A similar panel of BOEs decreased when dual users transitioned to exclusive e-cigarette use; NNAL levels decreased by 96%, from a mean of 143.4 pg/mg creatinine (95% CI, 86.7-237.0 pg/mg creatinine) to 6.3 pg/mg creatinine (95% CI, 3.5-11.4 pg/mg creatinine; P < .001). Nicotine metabolites, TSNAs, PAHs, and VOCs significantly increased when baseline exclusive e-cigarette users transitioned to exclusive cigarette use or dual use. Switching from exclusive cigarette use to dual use was not associated with significant decreases in BOEs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This national cohort study provides evidence on the potential harm reduction associated with transitioning from exclusive cigarette use or dual use to exclusive e-cigarette use. e-Cigarettes tend to supplement cigarettes through dual use instead of cessation at the population level. Continuous monitoring of BOE at the population level and assessment of BOE change by product transition are warranted, as well as defined adverse health outcomes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether vaping prevention advertisements from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) national Real Cost campaign lead to lower susceptibility to vaping among adolescents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: For this 3-group randomized clinical trial with parallel assignment, participants were US adolescents aged 13 to 17 years who were susceptible to vaping or current e-cigarette users, recruited from online panels. Adolescents were randomized to 1 of 2 Real Cost vaping prevention trial groups (health harms- or addiction-themed advertisements) or to a control group (investigator-created neutral videos about vaping). Adolescents completed 4 weekly online surveys at visits 1 to 4 over a 3-week period. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2021, to August 25, 2022. INTERVENTIONS: Adolescents saw 3 randomly ordered 30-second video advertisements online at each of 3 weekly study visits (visits 1, 2, and 3). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary trial outcome was susceptibility to vaping. Surveys also assessed susceptibility to smoking cigarettes to examine any spillover effects of vaping prevention advertisements on smoking outcomes. Both susceptibility measures had 3 items and ranged from 1 (indicating not susceptible) to 4 (indicating highly susceptible). The primary analyses compared Real Cost groups (combined) with the control group, while exploratory analyses compared the Real Cost groups with each other. RESULTS: Participants were 1514 adolescents (1140 [75.3%] boys; mean [SD] age, 15.22 [1.18] years), including 504 randomized to the Real Cost health harms group, 506 randomized to the Real Cost addiction group, and 504 randomized to the control group. Adolescents in the Real Cost groups (combined) had lower susceptibility to vaping at visit 4 than those in the control group (b = -0.21; 95% CI, -0.32 to -0.10). The Real Cost groups did not differ from one another on susceptibility to vaping (visit 4: b = -0.05; 95% CI, -0.17 to 0.07). Adolescents in the Real Cost groups (combined) also had lower susceptibility to smoking cigarettes than those in the control group (b = -0.21; 95% CI, -0.32 to -0.10). For both vaping and smoking, Real Cost groups had less positive attitudes (vaping: b = -0.27; 95% CI, -0.40 to -0.14; smoking: b = -0.23; 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.08) compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that vaping prevention advertisements from the FDA Real Cost campaign led to lower adolescent susceptibility to vaping and had beneficial spillover effects on cigarette smoking outcomes. Tobacco prevention campaigns can help reduce youth tobacco use.

OBJECTIVE: To measure intensity of use of e-cigarettes, cigarettes, and other tobacco products among US adolescents and their dependence level over time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study analyzed the cross-sectional National Youth Tobacco Surveys from 2014 to 2021. Confirmatory analysis was conducted using Youth Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from 2015 to 2019. The surveys were administered to national probability samples of US students in grades 6 to 12. EXPOSURES: Use of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products before and after the introduction of e-cigarettes delivering high levels of nicotine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: First tobacco product used, age at initiation of use, intensity of use (days per month), and nicotine addiction (measured as time after waking to first use of any tobacco product). RESULTS: A total of 151 573 respondents were included in the analysis (51.1% male and 48.9% female; mean [SEM] age, 14.57 [0.03] years). Prevalence of e-cigarette use peaked in 2019 and then declined. Between 2014 and 2021, the age at initiation of e-cigarette use decreased, and intensity of use and addiction increased. By 2017, e-cigarettes became the most common first product used (77.0%). Age at initiation of use did not change for cigarettes or other tobacco products, and changes in intensity of use were minimal. By 2019, more e-cigarette users were using their first tobacco product within 5 minutes of waking than for cigarettes and all other products combined. Median e-cigarette use also increased from 3 to 5 d/mo in 2014 to 2018 to 6 to 9 d/mo in 2019 to 2020 and 10 to 19 d/mo in 2021. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The changes detected in this survey study may reflect the higher levels of nicotine delivery and addiction liability of modern e-cigarettes that use protonated nicotine to make nicotine easier to inhale. The increasing intensity of use of modern e-cigarettes highlights the clinical need to address youth addiction to these new high-nicotine products over the course of many clinical encounters. In addition, stronger regulation, including comprehensive bans on the sale of flavored tobacco products, should be implemented.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate adults' use of ENDS and cigarette smoking following the CTP's prioritized enforcement efforts against fruit-flavored cartridge ENDS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this population-based, nationally representative US cohort study, data were collected from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study from December 2018 to November 2019 (hereafter referred to as 2019) and/or from September 2020 to December 2020 (Adult Telephone Survey, hereafter referred to as 2020). Adults (aged ≥21 years) who used ENDS in the past 30 days and smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days or quit smoking cigarettes in the past year (n = 3173) were evaluated. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2022, to May 2, 2023. EXPOSURE: ENDS flavor-device combinations used. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcome measures were cross-sectional prevalence of ENDS flavor-device combinations used in 2019 (n = 2654) and 2020 (n = 519) and longitudinal transitions in cigarette smoking (cessation [no smoking in the past 30 days in 2020 among those who smoked in 2019; n = 876] and relapse [smoking in the past 30 days in 2020 among those who recently quit in 2019; n = 137]) as a function of ENDS flavor-device combination used in 2019. RESULTS: The sample in 2019 included 2654 individuals (55% male [95% CI, 53%-58%]). Among those who used ENDS and smoked cigarettes, fruit-flavored cartridge ENDS use decreased from 13.9% (95% CI, 12.1%-15.9%) in 2019 to 7.9% (95% CI, 5.1%-12.1%) in 2020 (P = .01), whereas fruit-flavored disposable ENDS use increased from 4.0% (95% CI, 3.1%-5.1%) in 2019 to 14.5% (95% CI, 11.6%-18.0%) in 2020 (P < .001). Patterns were similar among those who recently quit smoking. Neither cigarette cessation nor relapse rates differed between those who used ENDS that were vs were not prioritized for enforcement efforts (cessation: 23.4% [95% CI, 18.1%-29.7%] vs 26.4% [95% CI, 22.4%-30.8%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.57-2.21; relapse: 32.7% [95% CI, 17.1%-53.4%] vs 29.8% [95% CI, 20.3%-41.3%]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.24-3.84). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this nationally representative US cohort study of adults who smoked cigarettes and used ENDS, fruit-flavored cartridge ENDS use was nearly halved between 2019 and 2020.

OBJECTIVE: To compare nicotine absorption among children who are (1) exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke only or (2) exposed to secondhand vapor only with (3) those exposed to neither. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The US Continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a repeat cross-sectional survey. Participants are interviewed in their homes and, several days after, visit a mobile examination center to provide biological specimens. This study uses data from a nationally representative sample of US households from 2017 to 2020. Participants were children aged 3 to 11 years with serum cotinine levels incompatible with current firsthand nicotine use (ie, <15 μg/L). The final analysis was conducted on January 9, 2024. EXPOSURES: Reported exposure to secondhand smoke or vapor indoors in the past 7 days (only secondhand smoke, only secondhand vapor, or neither). Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, family income, body weight, and height. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was serum cotinine concentration, an objective biomarker of nicotine absorption. Geometric mean cotinine levels and 95% CIs were calculated using log-normal tobit regression, accounting for the complex survey design and weights. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 1777 children surveyed was 7.4 (2.6) years, 882 (49.6%) were female, and 531 (29.9%) had family incomes below the poverty level. Nicotine absorption, as indexed by serum cotinine level, was highest among children only exposed to secondhand smoke (0.494 μg/L μg/L; 95% CI, 0.386-0.633 μg/L), followed by those exposed only to secondhand vapor (0.081 μg/L; 95% CI, 0.048-0.137 μg/L), equating to 83.6% (95% CI, 71.5%-90.5%; P < .001) lower nicotine absorption. Among children with no reported secondhand exposure, the geometric mean cotinine level was 0.016 μg/L (95% CI, 0.013-0.021 μg/L), or 96.7% (95% CI, 95.6%-97.6%; P < .001) lower than for those with exposure to secondhand smoke. Results were similar after covariate adjustment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of US children, nicotine absorption was much lower in children who were exposed to secondhand vapor vs secondhand smoke, but higher than in those exposed to neither. These findings suggest that switching from smoking to vaping indoors may substantially reduce, but not eliminate, children's secondhand exposure to nicotine and other noxious substances.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Regulatory loopholes have allowed tobacco manufacturers to use social media to target youths. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the extent to which synthetic nicotine e-cigarette brands have implemented US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) health warning requirements and to evaluate the association between health warnings and user engagement on Instagram. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, posts from 25 brands were analyzed across a 14-month period (August 2021 to October 2022). A content analysis was paired with Warning Label Multi-Layer Image Identification, a computer vision algorithm designed to detect the presence of health warnings and whether the detected health warning complied with FDA guidelines by (1) appearing on the upper portion of the advertisement and (2) occupying at least 20% of the advertisement's area. Data analysis was performed from March to June 2024. EXPOSURE: Synthetic nicotine e-cigarette advertisement on Instagram. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcome variables were user engagement (number of likes and comments). Negative binomial regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between the presence and characteristics of health warnings and user engagement. RESULTS: Of a total of 2071 posts, only 263 (13%) complied with both FDA health warning requirements. Among 924 posts with health warnings, 732 (79%) displayed warnings in the upper image portion, and 270 (29%) had a warning covering at least 20% of the pixel area. Posts with warnings received fewer comments than posts without warnings (mean [SD], 1.8 [2.5] vs 5.4 [11.7] comments; adjusted incident rate ratio [aIRR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57-0.86; P < .001). For posts containing warnings, a larger percentage of the warning label's pixel area was associated with fewer comments (aIRR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99; P = .003). Flavored posts with health warnings placed in the upper image portion received more likes than posts with warnings in the lower portion (mean [SD], 34.6 [35.2] vs 19.9 [19.2] likes; aIRR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.07-2.06; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of synthetic nicotine brand Instagram accounts, 87% of sampled posts did not adhere to FDA health warning requirements in tobacco promotions. Enforcement of FDA compliant health warnings on social media may reduce youth engagement with tobacco marketing.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

INTERVENTION: In all practices, household members completed EHR previsit questionnaires about tobacco use. Parents in intervention practices were proactively offered eCEASE (automated delivery of nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], quitline and/or SmokefreeTXT enrollment, and navigator support). Control practice parents received usual care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was biochemically confirmed 7-day abstinence from combusted tobacco use by parents at the 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes included NRT and quitline and/or SmokefreeTXT use and recent quit attempts. Changes in cigarettes per day and smoking frequency (daily or nondaily) from baseline to 1-year follow-up were also examined. RESULTS: Of 817 enrolled smoking parents (672 [82.3%] female), 323 of 408 (79.2%) in the intervention arm (6 practices) and 326 of 409 (79.7%) in the control arm (6 practices) were mothers; mean (SD) age was 36.17 (8.67) years. The follow-up survey was completed by 367 of 408 parents (90.0%) in the intervention arm and 368 of 409 (90.0%) in the control arm. Biochemically confirmed 7-day abstinence rates were 34 of 408 (8.3%) in the intervention arm vs 26 of 409 (6.4%) in the control arm (adjusted odds ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.79-2.29). Among those who completed follow-up, 177 of 367 (48.2%) in the intervention arm vs 59 of 368 (16.0%) in the control arm reported using NRT; 93 of 367 (22.8%) and 8 of 368 (2.2%), respectively, reported using quitline and/or SmokefreeTXT messaging; and 294 of 367 (80.1%) vs 258 of 368 (70.1%), respectively, reported a quit attempt in the last 3 months. Compared with control practices, intervention practices reported a greater reduction in the mean (SD) number of cigarettes smoked daily (-3.32 [5.39] vs -1.81 [5.84]) and a greater reduction in the mean (SD) percentage of daily smokers (-35.2% [2.6%] vs -25.8% [2.6%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cluster-randomized clinical trial of an automated intervention to treat parental tobacco use in pediatric practices, the intervention did not significantly improve the primary outcome of quit rate at 1 year. Findings in this trial demonstrated increased treatment engagement and reductions in cigarette consumption, but additional strategies are needed to improve quit rates.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a trend of increasing e-cigarette use among teens, with use rates doubling from 2011 to 2012. While several studies have documented that teens can and do buy cigarettes online, to our knowledge, no studies have yet examined age verification among Internet tobacco vendors selling e-cigarettes. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the extent to which minors can successfully purchase e-cigarettes online and assess compliance with North Carolina's 2013 e-cigarette age-verification law. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study conducted from February 2014 to June 2014, 11 nonsmoking minors aged 14 to 17 years made supervised e-cigarette purchase attempts from 98 Internet e-cigarette vendors. Purchase attempts were made at the University of North Carolina Internet Tobacco Vendors Study project offices using credit cards. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Rate at which minors can successfully purchase e-cigarettes on the Internet. RESULTS: Minors successfully received deliveries of e-cigarettes from 76.5% of purchase attempts, with no attempts by delivery companies to verify their ages at delivery and 95% of delivered orders simply left at the door. All delivered packages came from shipping companies that, according to company policy or federal regulation, do not ship cigarettes to consumers. Of the total orders, 18 failed for reasons unrelated to age verification. Only 5 of the remaining 80 youth purchase attempts were rejected owing to age verification, resulting in a youth buy rate of 93.7%. None of the vendors complied with North Carolina's e-cigarette age-verification law. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Minors are easily able to purchase e-cigarettes from the Internet because of an absence of age-verification measures used by Internet e-cigarette vendors. Federal law should require and enforce rigorous age verification for all e-cigarette sales as with the federal PACT (Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking) Act's requirements for age verification in Internet cigarette sales.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies that assessed initial use of e-cigarettes and subsequent cigarette smoking. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, the 2016 Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 22nd Annual Meeting abstracts, the 2016 Society of Behavioral Medicine 37th Annual Meeting & Scientific Sessions abstracts, and the 2016 National Institutes of Health Tobacco Regulatory Science Program Conference were searched between February 7 and February 17, 2017. The search included indexed terms and text words to capture concepts associated with e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes in articles published from database inception to the date of the search. STUDY SELECTION: Longitudinal studies reporting odds ratios for cigarette smoking initiation associated with ever use of e-cigarettes or past 30-day cigarette smoking associated with past 30-day e-cigarette use. Searches yielded 6959 unique studies, of which 9 met inclusion criteria (comprising 17 389 adolescents and young adults). DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tool, respectively. Data and estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Among baseline never cigarette smokers, cigarette smoking initiation between baseline and follow-up. Among baseline non-past 30-day cigarette smokers who were past 30-day e-cigarette users, past 30-day cigarette smoking at follow-up. RESULTS: Among 17 389 adolescents and young adults, the ages ranged between 14 and 30 years at baseline, and 56.0% were female. The pooled probabilities of cigarette smoking initiation were 30.4% for baseline ever e-cigarette users and 7.9% for baseline never e-cigarette users. The pooled probabilities of past 30-day cigarette smoking at follow-up were 21.5% for baseline past 30-day e-cigarette users and 4.6% for baseline non-past 30-day e-cigarette users. Adjusting for known demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral risk factors for cigarette smoking, the pooled odds ratio for subsequent cigarette smoking initiation was 3.62 (95% CI, 2.42-5.41) for ever vs never e-cigarette users, and the pooled odds ratio for past 30-day cigarette smoking at follow-up was 4.28 (95% CI, 2.52-7.27) for past 30-day e-cigarette vs non-past 30-day e-cigarette users at baseline. A moderate level of heterogeneity was observed among studies (I2 = 60.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: e-Cigarette use was associated with greater risk for subsequent cigarette smoking initiation and past 30-day cigarette smoking. Strong e-cigarette regulation could potentially curb use among youth and possibly limit the future population-level burden of cigarette smoking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

When used by non-pregnant smokers, pharmacotherapies (nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline) are effective for increasing smoking cessation, however their efficacy and safety in pregnancy remains unknown. Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are becoming widely used, but their efficacy and safety when used for smoking cessation in pregnancy are also unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and safety of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and ECs used during pregnancy for smoking cessation in later pregnancy and after childbirth, and to determine adherence to smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and ECs for smoking cessation during pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (20 May 2019), trial registers, and grey literature, and checked references of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in pregnant women, comparing smoking cessation pharmacotherapy or EC use with either placebo or no pharmacotherapy/EC control. We excluded quasi-randomised, cross-over, and within-participant designs, and RCTs with additional intervention components not matched between trial arms. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods. The primary efficacy outcome was smoking cessation in later pregnancy; safety was assessed by 11 outcomes (principally birth outcomes) that indicated neonatal and infant well-being. We also collated data on adherence to trial treatments. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each outcome for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 trials that enrolled a total of 2412 pregnant women who smoked at enrolment, nine trials of NRT and two trials of bupropion as adjuncts to behavioural support, with comparable behavioural support provided in the control arms. No trials investigated varenicline or ECs. We assessed four trials as at low risk of bias overall. The overall certainty of the evidence was low across outcomes and comparisons as assessed using GRADE, with reductions in confidence due to risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. Compared to placebo and non-placebo (behavioural support only) controls, there was low-certainty evidence that NRT increased the likelihood of smoking abstinence in later pregnancy (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.74; I² = 34%, 9 studies, 2336 women). However, in subgroup analysis by comparator type, there was a subgroup difference between placebo-controlled and non-placebo controlled RCTs (test for subgroup differences P = 0.008). There was unclear evidence of an effect in placebo-controlled RCTs (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55; I² = 0%, 6 studies, 2063 women), whereas non-placebo-controlled trials showed clearer evidence of a benefit (RR 8.55, 95% CI 2.05 to 35.71; I² = 0%, 3 studies, 273 women). An additional subgroup analysis in which studies were grouped by the type of NRT used found no difference in the effectiveness of NRT in those using patches or fast-acting NRT (test for subgroup differences P = 0.08). There was no evidence of a difference between NRT and control groups in rates of miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, birthweight, low birthweight, admissions to neonatal intensive care, caesarean section, congenital abnormalities, or neonatal death. In one study infants born to women who had been randomised to NRT had higher rates of 'survival without developmental impairment' at two years of age compared to the placebo group. Non-serious adverse effects observed with NRT included headache, nausea, and local reactions (e.g. skin irritation from patches or foul taste from gum), but data could not be pooled. Adherence to NRT treatment regimens was generally low. We identified low-certainty evidence that there was no difference in smoking abstinence rates observed in later pregnancy in women using bupropion when compared to placebo control (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.64; I² = 0%, 2 studies, 76 women). Evidence investigating the safety outcomes of bupropion use was sparse, but the existing evidence showed no difference between the bupropion and control group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: NRT used for smoking cessation in pregnancy may increase smoking cessation rates in late pregnancy. However, this evidence is of low certainty, as the effect was not evident when potentially biased, non-placebo-controlled RCTs were excluded from the analysis. Future studies may therefore change this conclusion. We found no evidence that NRT has either positive or negative impacts on birth outcomes; however, the evidence for some of these outcomes was also judged to be of low certainty due to imprecision and inconsistency. We found no evidence that bupropion may be an effective aid for smoking cessation during pregnancy, and there was little evidence evaluating its safety in this population. Further research evidence on the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy and EC use for smoking cessation in pregnancy is needed, ideally from placebo-controlled RCTs that achieve higher adherence rates and that monitor infants' outcomes into childhood. Future RCTs of NRT should investigate higher doses than those tested in the studies included in this review.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

The liquid usually comprises propylene glycol and glycerol, with or without nicotine and flavours, and stored in disposable or refillable cartridges or a reservoir. Since ECs appeared on the market in 2006 there has been a steady growth in sales. Smokers report using ECs to reduce risks of smoking, but some healthcare organizations, tobacco control advocacy groups and policy makers have been reluctant to encourage smokers to switch to ECs, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and safety. Smokers, healthcare providers and regulators are interested to know if these devices can help smokers quit and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This review is an update of a review first published in 2014. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and effect of using ECs to help people who smoke achieve long-term smoking abstinence. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO for relevant records from 2004 to January 2016, together with reference checking and contact with study authors. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which current smokers (motivated or unmotivated to quit) were randomized to EC or a control condition, and which measured abstinence rates at six months or longer. As the field of EC research is new, we also included cohort follow-up studies with at least six months follow-up. We included randomized cross-over trials, RCTs and cohort follow-up studies that included at least one week of EC use for assessment of adverse events (AEs). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up, and we used the most rigorous definition available (continuous, biochemically validated, longest follow-up). We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study, and where appropriate we pooled data from these studies in meta-analyses. MAIN RESULTS: Our searches identified over 1700 records, from which we include 24 completed studies (three RCTs, two of which were eligible for our cessation meta-analysis, and 21 cohort studies). Eleven of these studies are new for this version of the review. We identified 27 ongoing studies. Two RCTs compared EC with placebo (non-nicotine) EC, with a combined sample size of 662 participants. One trial included minimal telephone support and one recruited smokers not intending to quit, and both used early EC models with low nicotine content and poor battery life. We judged the RCTs to be at low risk of bias, but under the GRADE system we rated the overall quality of the evidence for our outcomes as 'low' or 'very low', because of imprecision due to the small number of trials. A 'low' grade means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. A 'very low' grade means we are very uncertain about the estimate. Participants using an EC were more likely to have abstained from smoking for at least six months compared with participants using placebo EC (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.96; placebo 4% versus EC 9%; 2 studies; 662 participants. GRADE: low). The one study that compared EC to nicotine patch found no significant difference in six-month abstinence rates, but the confidence intervals do not rule out a clinically important difference (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.34; 584 participants. GRADE: very low).Of the included studies, none reported serious adverse events considered related to EC use. The most frequently reported AEs were mouth and throat irritation, most commonly dissipating over time. One RCT provided data on the proportion of participants experiencing any adverse events. The proportion of participants in the study arms experiencing adverse events was similar (ECs vs placebo EC: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.34 (298 participants); ECs vs patch: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.22 (456 participants)). The second RCT reported no statistically significant difference in the frequency of AEs at three- or 12-month follow-up between the EC and placebo EC groups, and showed that in all groups the frequency of AEs (with the exception of throat irritation) decreased significantly over time. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence from two trials that ECs help smokers to stop smoking in the long term compared with placebo ECs. However, the small number of trials, low event rates and wide confidence intervals around the estimates mean that our confidence in the result is rated 'low' by GRADE standards. The lack of difference between the effect of ECs compared with nicotine patches found in one trial is uncertain for similar reasons. None of the included studies (short- to mid-term, up to two years) detected serious adverse events considered possibly related to EC use. The most commonly reported adverse effects were irritation of the mouth and throat. The long-term safety of ECs is unknown. In this update, we found a further 15 ongoing RCTs which appear eligible for this review.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and ease the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Although there is high-certainty evidence that NRT is effective for achieving long-term smoking abstinence, it is unclear whether different forms, doses, durations of treatment or timing of use impacts its effects. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords, most recently in April 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded studies that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up of fewer than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Separate reviews cover studies comparing NRT to control, or to other pharmacotherapies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking abstinence after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and study withdrawals due to treatment. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 68 completed studies with 43,327 participants, five of which are new to this update. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. We judged 28 of the 68 studies to be at high risk of bias. Restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results for any comparisons apart from the preloading comparison, which tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day whilst still smoking. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form plus patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.37; I2 = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg patches are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; I2 = 38%; 5 studies, 1655 participants), and that 21 mg patches are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08; 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 3446 participants). Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward. There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; I2 = 0%; 9 studies, 4395 participants). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; I2 = 0%; 8 studies, 3319 participants). We found no clear evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); duration of combination NRT use (low- and very low-certainty evidence); or fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence). Cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low- or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no clear evidence of an effect on these outcomes, and rates were low overall. More withdrawals due to treatment were reported in people using nasal spray compared to patches in one study (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46; 1 study, 922 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and in people using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two studies (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 544 participants; low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum can result in an increase in the chances of successfully stopping smoking. Due to imprecision, evidence was of moderate certainty for patch dose comparisons. There is some indication that the lower-dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher-dose products. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is limited. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are reported.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Types of mindfulness-based interventions include mindfulness training, which involves training in meditation; acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT); distress tolerance training; and yoga. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions for smoking cessation among people who smoke, and whether these interventions have an effect on mental health outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and trial registries to 15 April 2021. We also employed an automated search strategy, developed as part of the Human Behaviour Change Project, using Microsoft Academic. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs that compared a mindfulness-based intervention for smoking cessation with another smoking cessation programme or no treatment, and assessed smoking cessation at six months or longer. We excluded studies that solely recruited pregnant women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking cessation at the longest time point, using the most rigorous definition available, on an intention-to-treat basis. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for smoking cessation for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of intervention and type of comparator. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models. We summarised mental health outcomes narratively. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 studies, with 8186 participants. Most recruited adults from the community, and the majority (15 studies) were conducted in the USA. We judged four of the studies to be at low risk of bias, nine at unclear risk, and eight at high risk. Mindfulness-based interventions varied considerably in design and content, as did comparators, therefore, we pooled small groups of relatively comparable studies. We did not detect a clear benefit or harm of mindfulness training interventions on quit rates compared with intensity-matched smoking cessation treatment (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.46; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 542 participants; low-certainty evidence), less intensive smoking cessation treatment (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.19; I2 = 60%; 5 studies, 813 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or no treatment (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.53; 1 study, 325 participants; low-certainty evidence). In each comparison, the 95% CI encompassed benefit (i.e. higher quit rates), harm (i.e. lower quit rates) and no difference. In one study of mindfulness-based relapse prevention, we did not detect a clear benefit or harm of the intervention over no treatment (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.67; 86 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We did not detect a clear benefit or harm of ACT on quit rates compared with less intensive behavioural treatments, including nicotine replacement therapy alone (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.02; 1 study, 102 participants; low-certainty evidence), brief advice (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.75; 1 study, 144 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or less intensive ACT (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.01; 1 study, 100 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was a high level of heterogeneity (I2 = 82%) across studies comparing ACT with intensity-matched smoking cessation treatments, meaning it was not appropriate to report a pooled result. We did not detect a clear benefit or harm of distress tolerance training on quit rates compared with intensity-matched smoking cessation treatment (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.98; 1 study, 69 participants; low-certainty evidence) or less intensive smoking cessation treatment (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 8.08; 1 study, 49 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not detect a clear benefit or harm of yoga on quit rates compared with intensity-matched smoking cessation treatment (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.40 to 5.16; 1 study, 55 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Excluding studies at high risk of bias did not substantially alter the results, nor did using complete case data as opposed to using data from all participants randomised. Nine studies reported on changes in mental health and well-being, including depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and negative and positive affect. Variation in measures and methodological differences between studies meant we could not meta-analyse these data. One study found a greater reduction in perceived stress in participants who received a face-to-face mindfulness training programme versus an intensity-matched programme. However, the remaining eight studies found no clinically meaningful differences in mental health and well-being between participants who received mindfulness-based treatments and participants who received another treatment or no treatment (very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We did not detect a clear benefit of mindfulness-based smoking cessation interventions for increasing smoking quit rates or changing mental health and well-being. This was the case when compared with intensity-matched smoking cessation treatment, less intensive smoking cessation treatment, or no treatment. However, the evidence was of low and very low certainty due to risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, meaning future evidence may very likely change our interpretation of the results. Further RCTs of mindfulness-based interventions for smoking cessation compared with active comparators are needed. There is also a need for more consistent reporting of mental health and well-being outcomes in studies of mindfulness-based interventions for smoking cessation.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Stopping smoking can reduce this harm and many people would like to stop. There are a number of medicines licenced to help people quit globally, and e-cigarettes are used for this purpose in many countries. Typically treatments work by reducing cravings to smoke, thus aiding initial abstinence and preventing relapse. More information on comparative effects of these treatments is needed to inform treatment decisions and policies. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the comparative benefits, harms and tolerability of different smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and e-cigarettes, when used to help people stop smoking tobacco. SEARCH METHODS: We identified studies from recent updates of Cochrane Reviews investigating our interventions of interest. We updated the searches for each review using the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group (TAG) specialised register to 29 April 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs and factorial RCTs, which measured smoking cessation at six months or longer, recruited adults who smoked combustible cigarettes at enrolment (excluding pregnant people) and randomised them to approved pharmacotherapies and technologies used for smoking cessation worldwide (varenicline, cytisine, nortriptyline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and e-cigarettes) versus no pharmacological intervention, placebo (control) or another approved pharmacotherapy. Studies providing co-interventions (e.g. behavioural support) were eligible if the co-intervention was provided equally to study arms. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening, data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment (using the RoB 1 tool). Primary outcome measures were smoking cessation at six months or longer, and the number of people reporting serious adverse events (SAEs). We also measured withdrawals due to treatment. We used Bayesian component network meta-analyses (cNMA) to examine intervention type, delivery mode, dose, duration, timing in relation to quit day and tapering of nicotine dose, using odds ratios (OR) and 95% credibility intervals (CrIs). We calculated an effect estimate for combination NRT using an additive model. We evaluated the influence of population and study characteristics, provision of behavioural support and control arm rates using meta-regression. We evaluated certainty using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: Of our 332 eligible RCTs, 319 (835 study arms, 157,179 participants) provided sufficient data to be included in our cNMA. Of these, we judged 51 to be at low risk of bias overall, 104 at high risk and 164 at unclear risk, and 118 reported pharmaceutical or e-cigarette/tobacco industry funding. Removing studies at high risk of bias did not change our interpretation of the results. Benefits We found high-certainty evidence that nicotine e-cigarettes (OR 2.37, 95% CrI 1.73 to 3.24; 16 RCTs, 3828 participants), varenicline (OR 2.33, 95% CrI 2.02 to 2.68; 67 RCTs, 16,430 participants) and cytisine (OR 2.21, 95% CrI 1.66 to 2.97; 7 RCTs, 3848 participants) were associated with higher quit rates than control. In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional eight (95% CrI 4 to 13), eight (95% CrI 6 to 10) and seven additional quitters per 100 (95% CrI 4 to 12), respectively. These interventions appeared to be more effective than the other interventions apart from combination NRT (patch and a fast-acting form of NRT), which had a lower point estimate (calculated additive effect) but overlapping 95% CrIs (OR 1.93, 95% CrI 1.61 to 2.34). There was also high-certainty evidence that nicotine patch alone (OR 1.37, 95% CrI 1.20 to 1.56; 105 RCTs, 37,319 participants), fast-acting NRT alone (OR 1.41, 95% CrI 1.29 to 1.55; 120 RCTs, 31,756 participants) and bupropion (OR 1.43, 95% CrI 1.26 to 1.62; 71 RCTs, 14,759 participants) were more effective than control, resulting in two (95% CrI 1 to 3), three (95% CrI 2 to 3) and three (95% CrI 2 to 4) additional quitters per 100 respectively. Nortriptyline is probably associated with higher quit rates than control (OR 1.35, 95% CrI 1.02 to 1.81; 10 RCTs, 1290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), resulting in two (CrI 0 to 5) additional quitters per 100. Non-nicotine/placebo e-cigarettes (OR 1.16, 95% CrI 0.74 to 1.80; 8 RCTs, 1094 participants; low-certainty evidence), equating to one additional quitter (95% CrI -2 to 5), had point estimates favouring the intervention over control, but CrIs encompassed the potential for no difference and harm. There was low-certainty evidence that tapering the dose of NRT prior to stopping treatment may improve effectiveness; however, 95% CrIs also incorporated the null (OR 1.14, 95% CrI 1.00 to 1.29; 111 RCTs, 33,156 participants). This might lead to an additional one quitter per 100 (95% CrI 0 to 2). Harms There were insufficient data to include nortriptyline and non-nicotine EC in the final SAE model. Overall rates of SAEs for the remaining treatments were low (average 3%). Low-certainty evidence did not show a clear difference in the number of people reporting SAEs for nicotine e-cigarettes, varenicline, cytisine or NRT when compared to no pharmacotherapy/e-cigarettes or placebo. Bupropion may slightly increase rates of SAEs, although the CrI also incorporated no difference (moderate certainty). In absolute terms bupropion may cause one more person in 100 to experience an SAE (95% CrI 0 to 2). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The most effective interventions were nicotine e-cigarettes, varenicline and cytisine (all high certainty), as well as combination NRT (additive effect, certainty not rated). There was also high-certainty evidence for the effectiveness of nicotine patch, fast-acting NRT and bupropion. Less certain evidence of benefit was present for nortriptyline (moderate certainty), non-nicotine e-cigarettes and tapering of nicotine dose (both low certainty). There was moderate-certainty evidence that bupropion may slightly increase the frequency of SAEs, although there was also the possibility of no increased risk. There was no clear evidence that any other tested interventions increased SAEs. Overall, SAE data were sparse with very low numbers of SAEs, and so further evidence may change our interpretation and certainty. Future studies should report SAEs to strengthen certainty in this outcome. More head-to-head comparisons of the most effective interventions are needed, as are tests of combinations of these. Future work should unify data from behavioural and pharmacological interventions to inform approaches to combined support for smoking cessation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

OBJECTIVES: Primary objectives • To evaluate the benefits and harms of ONP when used to help people transition away from combustible tobacco use (smoking). • To evaluate the impact of ONP on the prevalence of combustible tobacco use. Secondary objectives • To evaluate the benefits and harms of ONP when used to help people transition away from other non-combustible tobacco/commercial nicotine product use. • To evaluate the impact of ONP on the prevalence of use of other non-combustible tobacco/commercial nicotine products. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO from 2000 to 13 January 2025. We also covered ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP through our search of CENTRAL. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ONP in people using tobacco or other non-combustible tobacco/non-pharmaceutical nicotine products. RCTs must have reported tobacco/nicotine use at 4+ weeks or biomarkers or adverse events at 1+ weeks. We also sought interrupted/multiple time-series studies of ONP's population-level effects on the prevalence of use of other tobacco/nicotine products. OUTCOMES: Our critical outcomes were: smoking abstinence at 4+ weeks; number of people reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) at 1+ weeks; and change in the prevalence of smoking. Important outcomes included tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb), metals, and inflammatory markers detected in human biosamples. RISK OF BIAS: We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess risk of bias. SYNTHESIS METHODS: We synthesised results using random-effects meta-analysis where possible. We used I2 to quantify statistical heterogeneity. Where meta-analysis was not possible, we graphically plotted available data in forest plots. We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. INCLUDED STUDIES: We included four small studies (n < 150 for each, total n = 284; 3 independent, 1 industry-funded; 3 at high risk of bias and 1 at unclear risk of bias). All were RCTs in people who smoked combustible cigarettes at baseline. Three were conducted in the USA, and one in New Zealand. Two compared higher- versus lower-nicotine dose ONP. Two compared ONP to instructions to continue smoking as usual. One each compared ONP to electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), snus, and pharmaceutical nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: Smoking abstinence Smoking abstinence may be slightly higher in people randomised to ONP compared to no intervention at eight-week follow-up (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.32; 1 study, 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence (risk of bias and imprecision; CI incorporated possibility of no difference)), but the evidence is very uncertain. Low-certainty evidence (serious imprecision; CI incorporated possibility of no difference) suggests there may be lower abstinence rates in those randomised to ONP compared to e-cigarettes (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.02; 1 study, 36 participants). Evidence from one study (n = 30) comparing higher- versus lower-dose ONP found a higher quit rate in the higher-dose arm, but again with wide CI encompassing the possibility of no difference and of higher quit rates in the lower-dose arm (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.26 to 96.13; evidence certainty not assessed). Serious adverse events No SAEs occurred in the three studies reporting this outcome. Data were available for the comparisons ONP versus minimal control (2 studies, 124 participants; very low-certainty evidence (risk of bias and serious imprecision)) and ONP versus e-cigarettes (1 study, 26 participants; low-certainty evidence (serious imprecision)). TSNA One study reported on a TSNA (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL)) comparing ONP with instructions to continue smoking. There may be lower levels with ONP (MD -265.30 ng/g creatinine, 95% CI -350.64 to -179.96; 53 participants; very low-certainty evidence (risk of bias and imprecision)), but the evidence is very uncertain. Data from two studies suggested no difference in NNAL levels between higher- and lower-dose ONP (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -1.87 to 1.56; I2 = 0%; 77 participants; evidence certainty not assessed). COHb Based on one study, there may be lower levels of COHb with ONP compared to instructions to continue smoking (MD -6.7%, 95% CI -8.33 to -5.07; 53 participants; very low-certainty evidence (risk of bias and imprecision)), but the evidence is very uncertain. When comparing higher- versus lower-dose ONP, the same study found very slightly lower levels in the higher-dose group, with the 95% CI incorporating the possibility of no difference (MD -0.40%, 95% CI -1.19 to 0.39; evidence certainty not assessed). No studies reported on prevalence, inflammatory markers, metals, or use of tobacco/nicotine products other than cigarettes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence on the use of ONP for cessation or reduction of cigarette use. There is no evidence on the use of ONP for cessation or reduction of other tobacco or nicotine products or on the effects of ONP on prevalence of tobacco use/nicotine vaping. Low-certainty evidence suggests that people randomised to ONP may be slightly less likely to quit smoking than those randomised to e-cigarettes, but data were from one small study and therefore imprecise. Limited, short-term data did not identify any serious health harms from ONP when used to help people transition away from tobacco smoking. More research on the effects of ONP for cessation or reduction of use of other tobacco or non-pharmaceutical nicotine products is urgently needed. Future trials should prioritise comparing ONP to other active interventions (e.g. NRT and e-cigarettes).

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on a sample of Brazilian tobacco workers. The sample was described according to socio-demographic, behavioral, and occupational variables. Gender-stratified multivariate analyses examined variables associated with GTS. RESULTS: GTS prevalence among men in the previous month was 6.6%, while among women it was 11.9%. Among men, age, being a non-smoker, hanging tobacco sticks in the barn, harvesting wet leaves, and exposure to physical exertion were risk factors for GTS. Among women, tying hands of tobacco, transporting bales, harvesting wet leaves, having had contact with pesticides, and exposure to physical exertion were positively associated with GTS. CONCLUSION: Research is required to improve methods for GTS screening, as well as the ability to distinguish GTS from pesticide poisoning.

It can directly threaten ecological security and human health in tobacco waste, wastewater, and other forms of tobacco production. Therefore, it is the basis of nicotine pollution prevention and of great application value to explore efficient and a wide range of nicotinophilic bacteria for tobacco industry and environmental protection. In this study, one nicotinophilic bacterium was isolated from the soil, which accumulated tobacco waste over 50 years at a Hefei cigarette factory. The strain was named aRF-1, which was identified as Arthrobacter sp. by analysis. The nicotine degradation tests showed that the optimum temperature for cell growth and metabolism of nicotine of Arthrobacter sp. aRF-1 was 30 °C, and the optimum initial pH value was about 7.0. Under the optimum experimented conditions, it can tolerance nicotine concentration as high as 8 g·L-1 . The highest removal rate of nicotine was 93.8% in 72 H in nonsterilization contaminated soil by Arthrobacter sp. aRF-1. LC-MS/MS was used to analyze the nicotine metabolic intermediates of strain Arthrobacter sp. aRF-1. A total of nine major metabolites that were detected were able to metabolize nicotine along a variant pathway of pyridine and pyrrolidine, and there may be more than two nicotine metabolic pathways for Arthrobacter sp. aRF-1 through the analysis of the main intermediate products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

A 500 microL urine sample was pH-adjusted with phosphate buffer (1.5 mL) containing nicotine-methyl-d3, cotinine-methyl-d3 and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine-methyl-d3 internal standards. For the unconjugated metabolites, an aliquot (800 microL) of the buffered solution was applied to a 30 mg Oasis HLB-SPE column, rinsed with 2% NH4OH/H2O (3.0 mL) and H2O (3.0 mL) and eluted with methanol (500 microL). The eluate was analyzed isocratically (100% methanol) by LC-MS/MS on a diol column (50 x 2.1 mm). For the total metabolites, a beta-glucuronidase/buffer preparation (100 microL) was added to the remaining buffered solution and incubated at 37 degrees C (20 h). An aliquot (800 microL) of the enzymatically treated buffered solution was extracted and analyzed in the same manner. The conjugated metabolites were determined indirectly by subtraction. The quantitation range of the method (ng/mL) was 14-10,320 for nicotine, 15-9800 for cotinine and 32-19,220 for trans-3'-hydroxycotinine. The validated method was used to observe diurnal variations from a smoker's spot urine samples, elimination half-lives from a smoker's 24 h urine samples and metabolite distribution profiles in the spot and 24 h urine samples.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: The study included 1409 adult cancer survivors from Wave 5 of the US Food and Drug Administration Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. A multivariate analysis of variance controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity assessed the association of cigarette smoking and vaping on cancer-related symptom burden (fatigue, pain, emotional problems) and quality of life (QoL). Generalized linear mixed models controlling for the same factors were used to assess associations among symptom burden, QoL, and quit-smoking intentions, quit-smoking likelihood, and past 12-month smoking quit attempts. RESULTS: Weighted rates of current cigarette smoking and vaping were 14.21% and 2.88%, respectively. Current smoking was associated with greater fatigue (p < .0001; partial η 2 = .02), pain (p < .0001; partial η 2 = .08), emotional problems (p < .0001; partial η 2 = .02), and worse QoL (p < .0001; partial η 2 = .08). Current vaping was associated with greater fatigue (p = .001; partial η 2 = .008), pain (p = .009; partial η 2 = .005), and emotional problems (p = .04; partial η 2 = .003), but not worse QoL (p = .17). Higher cancer symptom burden was not associated with reduced interest in quitting, likelihood of quitting, or odds of past year quit attempts (p > .05 for each). CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with cancer, current smoking and vaping were associated with greater symptom burden. Survivors' interest in and intentions to quit smoking were not related to symptom burden. Future research should examine the role of tobacco cessation in improving symptom burden and QoL.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

METHODS: Between May 25, 2021, and December 31, 2022, adult patients (≥18 years) visiting clinics affiliated with the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center were screened for smoking status. Those currently smoking were referred to a telehealth pharmacy-assisted TTP. An attempt was made to contact referred patients by phone. Patients reached were offered free smoking cessation counseling and a 2-week starter kit of nicotine replacement medication. A random sample of 420 patients enrolled in the TTP were selected to participate in a telephone survey to assess smoking status 4 to 12 months after enrollment. RESULTS: During the reference period 35,756 patients were screened and 9.3% were identified as currently smoking. Among the 3319 patients referred to the TTP at least once, 2393 (72.1%) were reached by phone, of whom 426 (12.8%) were ineligible for treatment, 458 (13.8%) opted out of treatment, and 1509 (45.5%) received treatment. More than 90% of TTP enrollees smoked daily, with an average of 13.1 cigarettes per day. Follow-up surveys were completed on 167 of 420 patients, of whom 23.4% to 33.5% reported not smoking; if all nonresponders to the survey are counted as smoking, the range of quit rates is 9.3% to 13.3%.

Two ""loading cigarettes"" were smoked after overnight, and a ""reward cigarette"" was smoked after 6 hours of daytime, abstinence. Blood nicotine concentrations, expired carbon monoxide, withdrawal/craving, and reward questionnaires were collected before/after smoking and during daytime abstinence. Compared with slow metabolizers, fast metabolizers had a shorter nicotine elimination half-life (P < 0.001), lower plasma nicotine concentrations (P < 0.001), and higher withdrawal/craving scores (P < 0.05) for most times during daytime abstinence, indicating that fast metabolizers are likely smoking more to relieve withdrawal symptoms (negative reinforcement). Reward/satisfaction scores were similar in fast and slow metabolizers, suggesting that faster nicotine metabolism, assessed by NMR, is not associated with greater positive reinforcement.

Several previous studies have attempted to correlate indices of tobacco smoke exposure (e.g. nicotine, cotinine, tar intake) with urinary mutagenicity, with conflicting results. These studies generally involved small numbers of smokers and did not carefully control diet, which is known to affect urinary mutagenicity markedly. Our objective was to conduct a controlled study to determine clearly if there were a correlation between urinary nicotine, cotinine, or nicotine + cotinine and urinary mutagenicity and to determine if nicotine or its major metabolite plays a role in the mutagenicity of urine from cigarette smokers. We used a large number of smokers (31), each of whom smoked both a tobacco-burning cigarette and a tobacco-heating cigarette on consecutive weeks, and we prepared and served identical diets to all subjects. Nicotine and cotinine concentrations were determined in small aliquots from urine samples collected over 24 hr, and the remaining urine sample was extracted and concentrated on XAD-2 resin for mutagenicity assays in the Salmonella/microsome test. Nicotine, cotinine, and nicotine + cotinine were statistically correlated with mutagenicity of urine from smokers of the tobacco-burning cigarette, but there was no correlation between nicotine, cotinine, or nicotine + cotinine and mutagenicity of urine from smokers of the tobacco-heating cigarettes. Thus, although urinary nicotine and cotinine concentrations correlate with urinary mutagenicity in smokers of tobacco-burning cigarettes, the present results indicate that nicotine and its metabolite are not responsible for the mutagenicity of smokers' urine.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We re-evaluate data from the period of time before the writing of the Surgeon General report, using quasi-experimental methods, and reach the opposite conclusion. We study contemporaneous and intertemporal effects of e-cigarette and cigarette price and tax changes. Our price variation comes from 35,000 retailers participating in the Nielsen Retail Scanner data system. We match price and tax variation to survey data on current use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes for over 94,000 students between grades 6 and 12 in the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) for years 2011-2015. We find evidence that e-cigarettes and cigarettes are same-period economic substitutes. Coefficient estimates (while imprecisely estimated) also suggest potentially large positive effects of past e-cigarette prices on current cigarette use, indicating intertemporal economic substitution. Our findings raise doubts about the conclusion of government-sponsored reports that e-cigarettes and cigarettes are strongly positively associated. We recommend revisiting and possibly amending this conclusion.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: New Zealand-based online e-cigarette retailer websites were identified using a keyword search. Ten New Zealand-based retailer websites were selected based on top results from Google. The four leading tobacco companies operating in New Zealand were also included. A content analysis of the online marketplace was performed. RESULTS: Price was variable, with disposable devices sold from as little as $9.99 (NZD). Online e-cigarette retailers frequently presented health (79%) and smoking cessation (71%) messages. Nicotine addiction warnings were explicit in less than half of retailer sites (43%) and only 29% of retailers stated that the use of devices may pose health risks. Marketing techniques with potential youth appeal included sweet flavours (80%) and cartoon characters on e-liquid products (20%). Only one retailer had an age verification procedure to purchase a product. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that online marketing is likely to appeal to young people despite industry assurances that e-cigarettes are only promoted to adult smokers who want to quit. Regulations for online retailers are urgently needed. SO WHAT?: This study adds to the surveillance research on the online marketing of e-cigarette retailers. Study findings may help inform future decisions on the regulation of e-cigarette marketing in New Zealand.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Policymakers face a challenge to balance the impacts of regulation on those who use e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool while protecting people who do not smoke from the harms of e-cigarette use, particularly young people. Previous research has demonstrated varying perspectives on e-cigarette regulation according to different stakeholders and interest groups. This study examined key stakeholders' positions on the drafted legislation to regulate e-cigarettes in NZ. METHODS: Using written submissions made during public consultation in 2020, we conducted a content analysis to determine levels of support for e-cigarette regulations. Submissions made by the e-cigarette industry and the health sector were included for analysis. RESULTS: The tobacco industry is heavily invested in ensuring that e-cigarettes continue to be promoted and available in NZ with minimal restrictions. On the contrary, health organisations supported the introduction of regulations to reduce marketing to, and use of e-cigarettes by youth and people who do not smoke. CONCLUSIONS: The industry opposes restrictions using similar approaches employed against tobacco control measures. Despite perceptions of division, the health sector is generally unified in support of e-cigarette restrictions. SO WHAT?: Policymakers must protect public health policies from commercial interests and be cautious of opposition framed as public health concerns.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

It explains the underlying concept: the highly addictive nature of nicotine prompts policy focus on preventing initial use by forbidding sales to those born after a prescribed cut-off birthdate, while resisting prohibition for those in older cohorts who may already be nicotine-dependent. The policy signals that there is no safe age for tobacco products. We examine how to assess whether a jurisdiction is ready for TFG, and then, how to maximise its effectiveness. That involves considering preparatory steps. Implementation of TFG is discussed, including which tobacco or nicotine products should be covered, on which actions there should be focus, choice of a suitable cut-off birthdate, and the most helpful companion measures. We also outline potential pushback from the tobacco industry and others, and indicate appropriate responses.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Such products would be expected to have less ""tar"" and other combustion products than cigarettes that burn tobacco. With one product of this type, benzo(a)pyrene, N-nitrosamines, phenolic compounds, acetaldehyde, acrolein, hydrogen cyanide, and N-heterocyclic compounds have been reduced 10- to 100-fold compared to the Kentucky reference (1R4F) cigarette, a representative low-tar cigarette. The yields of nicotine and carbon monoxide from this new cigarette are less than the yields of 95% and 75%, respectively, of the cigarettes sold in the United States during 1988. Nicotine absorption from smoking this new cigarette is not significantly different from that of tobacco-burning cigarettes yielding equivalent levels of nicotine. The urine mutagenicity of smokers of new cigarettes is significantly less (P less than .05) than that of smokers of tobacco-burning cigarettes and is not significantly different (P greater than .10) from that of nonsmokers. We conclude that cigarettes which heat rather than burn tobacco can reduce the yield of tobacco combustion products. This simplification of smoke chemistry had no effect on nicotine absorption in smokers and resulted in a reduction of biological activity in smokers as measured by urine mutagenicity.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Although cigarette use has declined, the popularity of novel tobacco products (NTPs), such as electronic cigarettes (ECs) and heated tobacco products (HTPs), has increased. Given the evolving landscape of the tobacco industry, robust in vitro models are needed to evaluate the potential for harm of novel products on the airways. We applied a 3D in vitro human airway organ tissue equivalent (OTE) model to evaluate its ability to characterize the acute effects of aerosol exposure from a combustible cigarette, an HTP, and two ECs using a VITROCELL VC1 Smoking Machine. Each product was tested using a nicotine-matched single exposure dose, providing a standardized benchmark relevant to real-world use. To deliver comparable amounts of nicotine (~35-38 μg), exposures ranged from 20 to 64 min depending on the product. Following exposure, OTEs were evaluated for cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, epithelial barrier function, ciliary function, inflammatory cytokine release, and inflammatory gene expression changes. Compared to cigarettes, NTP exposures resulted in reduced OTE cytotoxicity and inflammation. HTP exposure resulted in moderate cytotoxicity and oxidative stress, an increased inflammatory response, reduced epithelial barrier function, and temporary impairment of ciliary function. For the selected nicotine-matched dose, neither EC notably induced cytotoxicity nor inflammation or disrupted epithelial barrier or ciliary function. This work establishes a methodology for comparing NTPs using a physiologically relevant human in vitro model and supports further examination of NTPs using delivered nicotine as a benchmark.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Because cigarette smoking is sustained by nicotine addiction and the toxic combustion products are mainly responsible for the harmful effects of smoking, ENDS could be used to promote smoking cessation while exposing users to lower levels of toxicants compared with conventional cigarettes. The currently available evidence from clinical and observational studies indicates a potential role of e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids, although many continue to use e-cigarettes long after quitting smoking. Nicotine and toxicant delivery vary considerably by device and depend on the characteristics of the e-liquid formulation. Because smokers tend to titrate their nicotine intake to maintain their desired pharmacologic effects, device and liquid characteristics need to be considered when using ENDS as an aid to quit smoking. Factors potentially limiting their use are the currently still unknown long-term safety of these products and concerns regarding widespread use among youth. Implications of clinical pharmacology data on ENDS for the cigarette endgame and regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug administration are discussed.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study aims to further characterize their ability to deliver nicotine effectively. This randomized seven-way crossover PK study in healthy oral pouch consumers evaluated 11 and 20 mg NPs used for 10, 20, and 30 min, and for 30 min with expulsion of saliva. Used pouches were analyzed for extracted nicotine, flavor components, and sweeteners. The Cmax and AUC0-4 h increased with nicotine strength and usage time (18.9-21.6 and 26.7-33.6 ng/mL; 24.6-43.0 and 36.4 to 65.6 h ng/mL for the 11 and 20 mg NPs, respectively). Extracted nicotine was greater for the 11-mg than for the 20-mg NP, (10 min, 28.0% vs. 22.4%; 20 min, 35.8% vs. 29.6%; 30 min, 43.7% vs. 36.9%, respectively). Only 1.8% of the nicotine measured in the reference NPs was detected in saliva collected over the 30 min use period. Use of 20-mg NP for 30 min resulted in the extraction of 30.1% flavor components and 17.3% sweeteners, but only 0.16% and 3.4% of the amount measured in the reference NPs were detected in saliva, respectively. Thus, very little nicotine, flavor components, and sweeteners were swallowed during NP use. This study shows NPs can deliver nicotine effectively to satisfy smokers' nicotine desire. Nicotine delivery to the consumer increases with the duration of use. Our findings suggest that smokers who switch completely to an NP can obtain their accustomed amount of nicotine during normal product use.

A notable clause in this Act permits the FDA to regulate nicotine yields. However, they cannot completely remove this addictive constituent from tobacco products. This restriction has prompted the FDA to seek research on the threshold dose of nicotine that does not support dependence. This idea of threshold dose has led to an interesting reframing of scientific questions. For example, some researchers studying nicotine from this regulatory perspective translated the notion of an addiction threshold to a construct thought to play a role in addiction but which can be more readily operationalized. Examples include reinforcement threshold, discrimination threshold, and reinforcer-enhancement threshold. In this Perspective Paper, we highlight the importance of behavioral pharmacology and, specifically, the experimental analysis of behavior to help establish a scientific basis for policy decisions regarding nicotine yields. Recent research, including exemplars provided herein, note vast individual differences in the effects of nicotine at a known dose. Unfortunately, the behavioral and biological factors that contribute to such individual variations remain to be understood. We believe that behavior analysts are uniquely well-positioned to contribute to this understanding.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using linked deidentified data from the British Columbia Ministry of Health during a government-sponsored smoking cessation reimbursement program.Three study cohorts were created based on first use of varenicline, bupropion, or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), for adults aged 18 or older, in the period September 30th, 2011 to March 31st, 2013. The study cohorts were analyzed for sequential episodes of pharmacotherapy, defined as re-initiating a smoking cessation pharmacotherapy after an initial episode of treatment and washout period. The statistical analysis used propensity score adjusted log-binomial regression models with one-year and two-year fixed follow-up after a 12-week washout period. A sensitivity analysis excluded the washout period. A secondary analysis investigated predictors of receiving a sequential episode of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy RESULTS: 116,442 participants of the B.C. Smoking Cessation Program were analyzed. Compared to NRT, varenicline users were 13% less likely, and bupropion users were 18% less likely, to re-start smoking cessation therapy within 1-year after an initial course of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential episodes of pharmacotherapy identified treatment failures to smoking cessation therapy. Based on sequential episodes of pharmacotherapy during a drug benefit policy of smoking cessation medications, varenicline and bupropion were more effective aids to smoking cessation than NRT. The method was also used to identify patient characteristics associated with treatment effectiveness.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

However, LA Burley 21 plants, in which the Nic1 and Nic2 loci controlling nicotine biosynthesis are deleted, are characterized by impaired leaf maturation that leads to poor leaf quality before and after curing. Polyamines are involved in key developmental, physiological, and metabolic processes in plants, and act as anti-senescence and anti-ripening regulators. We investigated the role of polyamines in tobacco leaf maturation by analyzing the free and conjugated polyamine fractions in the leaves and roots of four Burley 21 varieties: NA (normal alkaloid levels, wild-type control), HI (high intermediates, nic2 -), LI (low intermediates, nic1 -), and LA (nic1 - nic2 -). The pool of conjugated polyamines increased with plant age in the roots and leaves of all four varieties, but the levels of free and conjugated putrescine and spermidine were higher in the LI and LA plants than NA controls. The increase in the polyamine content correlated with delayed maturation and senescence, i.e., LA plants with the highest polyamine levels showed the most severe impaired leaf maturation phenotype, characterized by higher chlorophyll content and more mesophyll cells per unit leaf area. Treatment of LA plants with inhibitors of polyamine biosynthesis and/or the growth regulator Ethephon® reduced accumulation of polyamines, achieving a partial amelioration of the LA phenotype. Our data show that the regulation of polyamine homeostasis is strongly disrupted in LA plants, and that free and conjugated polyamines contribute to the observed impairment of leaf maturation.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Altria'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This two-step approach is difficult to implement when there are missing data since the AUC cannot be directly calculated for individuals with missing measurements. Simple methods for dealing with missing data include the complete case analysis and imputation. A recent study showed that the estimated mean AUC difference between treatment groups based on the linear mixed model (LMM), rather than on individually calculated AUCs by simple imputation, has negligible bias under random missing assumptions and only small bias when missing is not at random. However, this model assumes the outcome to be normally distributed, which is often violated in biomarker data. In this paper, we propose to use a LMM on log-transformed biomarkers, based on which statistical inference for the ratio, rather than difference, of AUC between treatment groups is provided. The proposed method can not only handle the potential baseline imbalance in a randomized trail but also circumvent the estimation of the nuisance variance parameters in the log-normal model. The proposed model is applied to a recently completed large randomized trial studying the effect of nicotine reduction on biomarker exposure of smokers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The aim was to map the number and locations of nicotine consumer organizations globally and describe their history, legal status, membership, structure, objectives, working methods and activities, and funding. METHODS: We identified active organizations through the use of existing networks and referrals. All identified organizations were contacted and asked to fill in an online self-completion survey through the representatives of the organizations. The data collected were cleaned and anonymized. Categorization and analysis of variable distributions were carried out. Responses to open-ended questions were analyzed qualitatively. RESULTS: A total of 52 active organizations were identified: 13 in Latin America, 8 in Africa, 24 in Europe, 5 in the Asia-Pacific region, and 2 in North America. Most were established from 2016 onward, and 39 were legally incorporated. Their reported objectives were to raise awareness about SNP, promote rights to access SNP, and advocate for a legal and regulatory environment in which SNPs are available. They are small organizations: Most are operated with volunteers, with only 7 having any contracted or paid staff, and only 13 persons globally with a paid position. A total of 31 organizations had not received any funding support. The total global funding for all organizations was US$ 309,810. None reported receiving funding from tobacco or pharmaceutical companies. All pointed to important achievements in the public debate about SNP and tobacco harm reduction. CONCLUSION: The organizations are run by enthusiastic individuals, most of whom have successfully quit smoking with the help of SNP. Organizations depend on the input of a small number of core workers, all organizations are under-resourced and potentially fragile, and yet, they report significant activity and success. The challenge for these groups is to gain recognition at national and international level as legitimate stakeholders in the development of tobacco control policy with respect to safer alternatives to smoking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Changes in the makeup of cigarettes and corresponding changes in smoke composition along with nicotine-compensating smoking patterns, such as the frequency of puff drawing and depth of inhalation, are suggested to have contributed to the observed epidemiologic profiles of these major histologic types of lung cancers. METHODS: The various changes in cigarette makeup leading to declining smoke yields from sales-weighted averages of 38 mg ""tar"" and 2.7 mg nicotine to 12 mg ""tar"" and 0.9 mg nicotine per cigarette are described. RESULTS: Higher nitrate content of tobacco blends is shown to be one of the major influences on lower smoke yields of carcinogenic polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) while causing increased yields of carcinogenic, tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNA). In vivo and in vitro bioassays incriminate PAH as inducers of squamous cell carcinoma, while TSNA are known to elicit primarily adenocarcinoma of the lung. CONCLUSIONS: The product changes, the smokers' dependence on nicotine which governs their smoking patterns, and the modified smoke chemistry support the hypothesis that differences in PAH and TSNA exposure may be linked to the observed different incidences of squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma of the lung.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

However, the risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and for cancer of the lung has not decreased; adenocarcinoma incidence even continues to rise faster than the rate of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Undiminished risk of cigarette smokers for COPD and lung cancer is largely due to more intense smoking and deeper inhalation of the smoke of ""low-yield"" cigarettes and to significant changes in the smoke yields of certain lung carcinogens. METHODS: Puff frequency, puff duration, and puff volume of cigarette smokers were determined by a microcomputer-assisted flow transducer. These parameters were then programmed into a smoking machine to generate mainstream smoke for quantifying nicotine and lung carcinogens. RESULTS: Simulating the human smoking characteristics increases the yields of ""tar"" and nicotine per cigarette two- to threefold above Federal Trade Commission-reported levels. Smoke yields of lung carcinogens like benzo[alpha]pyrene and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone parallel those of nicotine and ""tar."" CONCLUSIONS: The way people smoke and the total number of cigarettes consumed daily determine the uptake, i.e., the administered dose of nicotine, other toxic, and genotoxic smoke constituents. It is important to communicate this to consumers rather than letting the smokers believe that they are truly smoking a cigarette of lower smoke yields when they choose ""light"" or ""ultralight"" products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

It is suggested that research on youth tobacco initiation and cessation be given highest priority because of rising prevalence rates, fundamental social importance, and the widespread support for such efforts. Policy and community approaches to deterring youth tobacco use deserve particular attention. Adult intervention research should focus on health care settings and include factors that both help and hinder adoption and routine implementation of tobacco interventions by clinicians. Developing and evaluating practical ways of using nicotine replacement therapies or other pharmacological therapies in primary care are also of importance. Media interventions that segment the smoking population by age, ethnicity, and developmental milestones should be encouraged. Three approaches could profit from working conferences of investigators and other interested parties to review the data and suggest research directions: worksite interventions, interventions with ethnic populations, and matching or tailoring interventions to specified characteristics of smokers. The importance of devoting considerable resources to investigator-initiated contrasted with sponsor-directed research is discussed.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In the absence of governmental opposition, physicians are expected to lead tobacco control efforts. We studied Colombian medical students' smoking prevalence and tobacco attitudes. METHODS: First- and fifth-year students from 11 medical schools in seven Colombian cities answered anonymous, self-administered, 38-item questionnaires. Additionally, smokers answered the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). RESULTS: Two thousand twenty-one students (males 50.6%; age 15-44, median 19) completed the survey; average response rate was 89.9%. Globally 25.9% of students were current smokers (males 27.9%, females 24.0%). Living at higher altitude and attending private universities were associated with higher prevalence (P < 0.001). Males had a higher chance of having given up smoking (P < 0.05); 91.3% of current smokers would like to quit; 67.3% of all smokers and 44.8% of daily smokers scored 0 in the FTND. Prevalence was similar among first- and fifth-years, but fifth-year students were more complacent with smoking in health centers and showed a lesser desire to quit. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students' smoking prevalence is similar to that of the general population. Tobacco control strategies need to be included in the curriculum. Nicotine addiction does not seem to be the main perpetuating factor.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Interpretation of results by tobacco industry scientists, studies that measure free-base nicotine directly in tobacco smoke, and the variability of free-base nicotine in smokeless tobacco products all indicate that the form of nicotine delivered to the tobacco user, in addition to the total amount, is an important factor in whether people continue to use the product following their initial exposure. The physiological impact of nicotine varies with the fraction that is in the free-base form and this leads to continued exposure to other toxic tobacco contents and emissions.

Tobacco has proven to be a particularly effective vehicle for nicotine, enabling manipulation of smoke chemistry and of mechanisms of delivery, and providing sensory cues that critically inform patterns of smoking behavior as well as reinforce the impact of nicotine. A range of physical and chemical product design changes provide precise control over the quantity, form, and perception of nicotine dose, and support compensatory behavior, which is driven by the smoker's addiction to nicotine. Cigarette manufacturers also enhance the physiological effects of nicotine through the introduction and use of compounds that interact with nicotine but do not directly alter its form or delivery. A review of internal documents indicates important historical differences, as well as significant differences between commercial brands, underscoring the effectiveness of methods adopted by manufacturers to control nicotine dosing and target the needs of specific populations of smokers through commercial product development. Although the focus of the current review is on the manipulation of nicotine dosing characteristics, the evidence indicates that product design facilitates tobacco addiction through diverse addiction-potentiating mechanisms.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

This paper was written at a moment when the dependence liability of nicotine, the psychoactive component from tobacco, was the center of a dispute between the tobacco manufacturing companies and the scientific community (Nowak, 1994a-c). Without being comprehensive, it tries to summarize evidence compiled from several disciplines within neuroscience demonstrating that nicotine produces a true psychiatric disease, behaviorally expressed as dependence to the drug (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Nicotine dependence has a biological substratum defined as ""neuroadaptation to nicotine."" 2. The first part of the article defines terms such as ""abuse,"" ""tolerance,"" ""dependence,"" and ""withdrawal."" It discusses clinical and experimental facts at the whole-organism level, showing that animals and humans will seek and self-administer nicotine because of its rewarding properties. 3. The second part discusses the neurobiological basis of neuroadaptation to nicotine. It presents information on neuroanatomical circuits which may be involved in nicotine-related brain disorders, such as the mesocorticolimbic pathway and the basal forebrain-frontal cortex pathway. It also discusses work from several laboratories, including our own, that support the notion of a molecular basis for neuroadaptative changes induced by nicotine in the brain of a chronic smoker. 4. Although still under experimental scrutiny, the hallmark of neuroadaptation to nicotine is up-regulation of nicotinic receptors, possibly due to nicotine-induced desensitization of their function (Marks et al., 1983; Schwartz and Kellar, 1985). A correlation between these plastic changes and the behavioral data obtained from animal and human experiments is still needed to understand dependence to nicotine fully.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Resting eyes-closed and eyes-open EEG was recorded from F3, F4, P3, and P4 before and after quantified smoke delivery (QSD). EEG dimensional complexity (DCx, a measure derived from chaos theory) was computed using the Takens-Ellner method. QSD appeared to have a 'flexible' effect on EEG DCx, primarily lowering it in subjects whose pre-smoking level was high, not affecting it in subjects whose pre-smoking level was intermediate, and tending to raise it in subjects whose pre-smoking level was low. This replicates previous results obtained with ad libitum smoking, suggesting the hypothesis that smoking may have an ""optimizing"" effect on the complexity of brain dynamics.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

To understand better the relationship between FTC nicotine yields and actual nicotine uptake in smokers, we have studied nicotine uptake in 33 smokers of self-selected products representing four ""tar"" groupings: 1 mg ""tar"" (1MG), ultra-low ""tar"" (ULT), full-flavor low ""tar"" (FFLT), and full flavor (FF) cigarettes. These cigarette categories had mean FTC nicotine yields of 0.14, 0.49, 0.67, and 1.13 mg/cigarette, respectively. The subjects smoked their usual brand of cigarette ad libitum and provided a 24-h urine sample for total nicotine uptake analysis over a period during which the number of cigarettes smoked was recorded. Nicotine uptake was determined by monitoring urinary nicotine and its metabolites, including the glucuronide conjugates. Daily nicotine uptake was 9.1 +/- 7.3 mg (range 1-21 mg) for 1MG, 19.2 +/- 10.0 mg (range 4-42 mg) for ULT, 21.8 +/- 9.4 mg (range 13-38 mg) for FFLT, and 37.1 +/- 14.4 mg (range 21-60 mg) for FF smokers. On a per cigarette basis, yields were 0.23 +/- 0.11, 0.56 +/- 0.23, 0.60 +/- 0.18, and 1.19 +/- 0.43 mg nicotine, respectively. Although individual variability was fairly large (CVs of 0.39-0.80), means for the different groups showed that lower FTC yield smokers not only absorb less nicotine per 24-h period, but also per cigarette smoked. These data suggest that nicotine uptake is a function of individual smoking behavior within product design limits. We conclude from these data that, while FTC yield cannot precisely predict nicotine uptake for an individual smoker, it is useful in predicting and comparing actual nicotine uptake by smokers who select cigarettes with a particular FTC yield.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Evidence of significant nonlinearity in the EEG was obtained, replicating previous results. However, unlike EEG dimensional complexity, EEG nonlinearity (difference between original and surrogate data) was not affected by smoking. This indicates that, under resting conditions, smoking/nicotine may have a modulating effect on input from the reticular activating system, with such input having a global, linearizing effect on cortical dynamics. Nonlinear dynamics resulting from intracortical processes appear not to be affected.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Plasma nicotine concentrations were significantly higher following smoking of the Control cigarette. HR (percent relative change) increased following smoking of either cigarette; however, HR increase was significantly greater following smoking of the Control cigarette. Smoking the Test cigarette had no effect on the EEG. Smoking the Control cigarette produced a significant increase in beta 2 magnitude and a significant decrease in delta magnitude.

In India, approximately 5500 children and adolescents start using tobacco products daily, some as young as 10 years old. The majority of users have first tried tobacco prior to age 18. Children and adolescents are exposed to the harmful effects of nicotine from smoking or second hand smoke from others; and from use of smokeless tobacco. There is increased prevalence of respiratory disease, ear and sinus infections, asthma, oral disease, and many long-term complications such as cardiovascular disease and cancers due to tobacco use. Prevention and treatment strategies include behavioural approaches and pharmacotherapy. There is an increased urgency especially, for countries like India to address the problem of tobacco use by children and adolescents as the tobacco industry faces legal and public opinion obstacles in Western countries like United States.

Arguably, such labelling implies that these varieties of cigarettes are less harmful than ""regular"" cigarettes. In Canada, a food product can be labelled ""light"" if there is a 25% reduction from the ""reference food"" and if the constituent being reduced is clearly identified (e.g., light in fat). Cigarette labelling does not comply with these regulations, however. To examine whether or not some tobacco constituents meet the 25% reduction criterion, we compared yields of 41 toxic and/or carcinogenic smoke constituents in six varieties of ""light"" cigarettes to the yields of ""regular"" cigarettes. We selected cigarettes from the two most popular Canadian brands, Du Maurier and Players. METHODS: Using a set of data provided by Imperial Tobacco Canada and made available to the public by the Government of British Columbia, we compared yields measured under a laboratory protocol (modified ISO) that was designed to provide a more rigorous evaluation of the differences between varieties of cigarettes and a more accurate assessment of smokers' potential smoke intake than the traditional protocol (standard ISO). FINDINGS: For all six varieties of ""light"" cigarettes, the yields of nicotine were higher by an average of 5% (range: 1% to 13%). The 25% reduction criterion was not met for any variety of ""light"" cigarettes concerning yields of tar. For all cigarettes tested, yields of tar were reduced on average by only 16% (range: 5% to 22%). For carbon monoxide (CO), only Player's Smooth Light had an over 25% reduction (30%) compared with Player's Regular. Conversely, yield of CO was 24% higher for Du Maurier Lights compared with Du Maurier Regular. As for the other smoke constituents, the majority (75%) were not reduced by 25% or more in ""light"" cigarettes, and a sizeable proportion of yields (e.g., acrylonitrile, benzene, chromium, m+p cresol, mercury, nickel, toluene) were larger in these varieties of cigarettes. Only yields of formaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, 1-aminonaphtalene, and proprionaldehyde were systematically reduced in all varieties of ""light"" cigarettes. CONCLUSION: The six varieties of ""light"" cigarettes examined in this study do not differ substantially from ""regular"" cigarettes in terms of smoke yields. We argue that the modified ISO protocol should be implemented for a more valid comparison of potential smoke yields in all varieties of cigarettes and that labelling based on this protocol should be promoted.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

There are extensive studies from manufacturers available, which show that the emissions of HnB tobacco devices have significantly lower levels of harmful substances compared to conventional cigarettes. In addition, manufacturers have published studies to investigate whether switching from a conventional tobacco cigarette to the HnB product reduces possible health risks.The purpose of this report is to review current studies by manufacturers and independent institutions as well as to discuss possible reduced health hazards.The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has carried out its own studies of selected analytes in the emissions of one HnB product confirming the lower levels of harmful substances in the emissions. The results are consistent with data from other independent studies. The nicotine content in the emissions is in the same range as the nicotine emissions of conventional cigarettes, which suggests a comparable addictiveness and dependence potential. Manufacturers have reported mutagenic effects of emissions by HnB tobacco devices that, however, are considerably weaker compared to conventional cigarettes. Nevertheless, the use of the HnB tobacco product remains associated with health risks.Switching from conventional cigarettes to tobacco heaters can significantly reduce the consumer's exposure to harmful substances. However, this article also illustrates that it is still unclear to what extent the reduced levels lead to lowered health risks.

It would be important to know which outcome the general population, and in particular the users of tobacco/ANDSs, would prefer. OBJECTIVE: Assessing public support for a comprehensive advertising ban on ANDSs in the German population, and particularly in tobacco and ANDSs users. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The German Study on Tobacco Use (""Deutsche Befragung zum Rauchverhalten"", DEBRA) is an ongoing, representative household survey of persons aged 14 years and older. Data from the June/July 2019 survey wave (n = 2019) were analysed. Participants were interviewed regarding their tobacco smoking status and ANDS use, sociodemographic factors, and their support of an advertising ban on ANDSs. Prevalence rates and associations (odds ratio, OR) between support and sociodemographic factors or use of tobacco/ANDSs are reported. RESULTS: Of the population, 57.0% (95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 54.7-59.1%) support a ban on ANDS advertising; 11.1% (95%CI = 9.8-12.6%) reject it. There is support for the ban from 46.0% (95%CI = 42.2-49.9%) of current tobacco smokers and 42.7% (95%CI = 35.9-49.6%) of ANDS users. Ex-smokers show the highest rates of support (64.8%, 95%CI = 58.9-70.3%). Acceptance among never- and ex-smokers is higher than among current smokers (adjusted OR 2.06, 95%CI = 1.64-2.59 and OR 1.65, 95%CI = 1.23-2.21). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the German population supports a comprehensive advertising ban on ANDSs. Tobacco smokers and ANDS users are also more in favour of than against such a ban. Thus, only little resistance will be expected within the population if a comprehensive tobacco advertising ban, as currently discussed in parliament, includes e‑cigarettes and heated tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The overall evidence suffers from many limitations, the most significant being the short-term exposure (≤12 weeks) and follow-up to NRT product use in most of the studies, the common failure to account for changes in smoking behaviour following NRT use, and the sparse information on SAHEs by type of NRT product used. The only SAHE from NRT exposure we identified was an increase in respiratory congenital abnormalities reported in one study. Limited evidence indicated a lack of effect between NRT exposure and SAHEs for CVD and various reproduction/developmental endpoints. For cancer, stroke and other SAHEs, the evidence was inadequate to demonstrate any association with NRT use.

Since more than a decade, innovative non-combusted tobacco products have emerged like heated tobacco products (HTP) or electronic cigarettes (EC). Long-term effects of these new products on health remain, however, unknown and there is a need to characterize associated potential health risks. The time dedicated to epidemiological data generation (at least 20 to 40 years for cancer endpoint), though, is not compatible with innovative development. Surrogates need, therefore, to be developed. In this work, non-cancer and cancer risks were estimated in a range of HTP and commercial combustible cigarettes based upon their harmful and potentially harmful constituent yields in aerosols and smoke, respectively. It appears that mean lifetime cancer risk values were decreased by more than one order of magnitude when comparing HTPs and commercial cigarettes, and significantly higher margin of exposure for non-cancer risk was observed for HTPs when compared to commercial cigarettes. The same approach was applied to two commercial ECs. Similar results were also found for this category of products. Despite uncertainties related to the factors used for the calculations and methodological limitations, this approach is valuable to estimate health risks associated to the use of innovative products. Moreover, it acts as predictive tool in absence of long-term epidemiological data. Furthermore, both cancer and non-cancer risks estimated for HTPs and ECs highlight the potential of reduced risk for non-combusted products when compared to cigarette smoking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,Yes,['Philip Morris International'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

To provide additional insight we use alternative modelling based on a shorter period (1991-2040), four main smoking-associated diseases, deaths aged 30-79 years, and a full product history. We consider variations in: assumed effective dose of e-cigarettes versus cigarettes (F); their relative quitting rate (Q); proportions smoking after 10 years (X); and initiation rate (I) of vaping, relative to smoking. METHODS: We set F = 0.05, X = 5%, Q = 1.0 and I = 1.0 (Main Scenario) and F = 0.4, X = 10%, Q = 0.5 and I = 1.5 (Pessimistic Scenario). Sensitivity Analyses varied Main Scenario parameters singly; F from 0 to 0.4, X 0.01% to 15%, and Q and I 0.5 to 1.5. To allow comparison with prior work, individuals cannot be dual users, re-initiate, or switch except from cigarettes to e-cigarettes. RESULTS: Main Scenario reductions were 2.52 and 26.23 million deaths and life-years lost; Pessimistic Scenario reductions were 0.76 and 8.31 million. These were less than previously, due to the more limited age-range and follow-up, and restriction to four diseases. Reductions in deaths (millions) varied most for X, from 3.22 (X = 0.01%) to 1.31 (X = 15%), and F, 2.74 (F = 0) to 1.35 (F = 0.4). Varying Q or I had little effect. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial reductions in deaths and life-years lost were observed even under pessimistic assumptions. Estimates varied most for X and F. These findings supplement literature indicating e-cigarettes can importantly impact health challenges from smoking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Inhalation toxicology studies have revealed exposure to these toxicants may be toxic to humans. These studies informed the FDA's regulation of nicotine-containing E-cigs under the Tobacco Regulation Act (TRA) (2020) and the banning of all flavors in E-cig bars apart from tobacco and menthol. Furthermore, tobacco companies aiming to sell nicotine products on the US market ought to submit a premarket tobacco product application (PMTA) and obtain approval from the FDA before marketing. Nonetheless, because the PMTA process is lengthy/complicated, vape/tobacco companies utilized a loophole in the TRA (2020) and have introduced nicotine analogs in E-cig bars, such as 6-methyl nicotine (6-MN) and nicotinamide, which are not derived from nicotine or tobacco. These companies claim these analogs to be 'safer' alternatives to nicotine while providing similar satisfaction as nicotine. However, the safety profiles of these analogs are entirely unknown. Therefore, in this review, we have extrapolated the current literature on 6-MN and nicotinamide, and speculated their potential mode of toxicity through alterations in intracellular ROS and activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, transient receptor potential ankyrin-1, and NF-κB. These biomolecules are pivotal in the onset and regulation of pulmonary diseases such as COPD, asthma, and lung tumorigenesis/remodeling. Thus, primary research is urgently warranted to inform regulatory agencies of these emerging nicotine analogs' potential adverse health effects. This article provides insightful information on emerging vape products' potential toxicity for environmental toxicology research and regulation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

These changes in cortical activity may be indicative of withdrawal-related cognitive deficits, yet the markers of differences in cortical activity are not well-established. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to clarify the EEG frequency bands affected by nicotine deprivation and assess prospective moderators. METHOD: One hundred twenty-four heavy smokers visited the laboratory on two occasions following overnight smoking/nicotine deprivation. Prior to collecting 3 min of resting EEG data, participants smoked two very low nicotine cigarettes (<0.05 mg nicotine yield) at one session and two moderate nicotine cigarettes (0.60 mg nicotine yield) at the other. RESULTS: Theta and alpha-1 band (4-7 and 8-10 Hz) was greater in the very low nicotine (deprivation) relative to higher nicotine (satiation) condition. There were no condition differences in the beta-1 and beta-2 bands (14-20 and 21-30 Hz). CONCLUSIONS: Greater slow wave resting EEG may serve as a reliable marker of decreased cortical activity during smoking deprivation and, in turn, of withdrawal-related deficits in cognitive functioning. This research may inform the development of adjunct strategies for smoking cessation.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Nicotine may also increase cognitive control among nonsmokers, and this may vary as a function of trait cognitive control. It is important to examine the effects of nicotine on cognitive control-related processes among nonsmokers as these effects may provide a path for the initiation of smoking. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to examine in nonsmokers (1) the effect of nicotine on resting cortical activity, an indirect measure of cognitive control, and (2) trait cognitive control as a moderator of nicotine-induced cortical activity changes. METHOD: Eighty participants were given placebo and 7-mg nicotine patches in separate sessions for this counter-balanced, double-blind, within-subject study. Resting cortical activity was measured with EEG for a 3-min period with eyes opened. RESULTS: Average alpha-1 band power density values in frontal and central regions were lower during the nicotine versus placebo condition, which provides evidence of nicotine-induced cortical activation. Furthermore, those with lower self-reported cognitive control exhibited greater nicotine-induced reductions in alpha-1 power density values. CONCLUSIONS: These individual differences in nicotine-induced cortical activation are consistent with a model of nicotine self-medication whereby individuals with lower cognitive control may find smoking more reinforcing via amelioration of related cognitive deficits.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the abuse liability of three Vuse Solo ECs, ranging from 14 to 36 mg in nicotine content, relative to high- and low-abuse liability comparator products (usual brand combustible cigarettes and nicotine gum, respectively) in a group of 45 EC-naïve smokers. METHODS: Enrolled subjects' ratings of subjective effects and nicotine uptake over 6 h were used to measure abuse liability and pharmacokinetics following in-clinic use of each EC. RESULTS: Use of Vuse Solo resulted in subjective measures and nicotine uptake that were between those of combustible cigarettes and nicotine gum, although generally closer to nicotine gum. Compared to combustible cigarettes, use of Vuse Solo resulted in significantly lower scores in measures of product liking, positive effects, and intent to use again. These pharmacodynamic findings were consistent with the pharmacokinetic data, showing that cigarettes produced substantially faster and higher levels of nicotine uptake as compared to Vuse Solo and nicotine gum. Vuse Solo resulted in more rapid initial uptake of nicotine compared to nicotine gum, but peak concentration and long-term extent of uptake were not different or were lower with Vuse. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings suggest that Vuse Solo likely has an abuse liability that is somewhat greater than nicotine gum but lower than cigarettes.

OBJECTIVES: To assess differences in nicotine delivery, puffing topography, subjective effects, and user satisfaction from different flavored e-liquids. METHODS: Eighteen daily smokers (average age, 44.1 ± 7.0; 9 males; average CPD, 13.0 ± 5.8) smoked their tobacco cigarettes during an initial visit and returned five times to try an e-cigarette (eGo type) refilled with a nicotine solution (24 mg/ml) of five different flavors: cherry, tobacco, espresso, menthol, and vanilla (randomized order). Assessments at each visit included puffing topography, blood samples for nicotine analysis, and subjective reports of nicotine effects and flavor satisfaction. RESULTS: Vaping different flavors resulted in different levels of plasma nicotine. The flavor producing the highest plasma nicotine concentration (Cmax) was cherry (median 21.2 ng/ml), which was not significantly different than nicotine delivery from a combustible cigarette (29.2 ng/ml, p > .05). Vanilla e-liquid produced the lowest Cmax (9.7 ng/ml), and participants tended to puff less frequently on vanilla compared to tobacco flavor (p = .013). Flavors did not differ significantly in the speed of nicotine delivery (Tmax). During controlled use, puff duration for all flavors was significantly longer than a combustible cigarette (p < 0.05). After controlling for nicotine delivery, significant differences in flavor enjoyment were detected. Menthol flavored e-liquid was rated as more enjoyable than vanilla and tobacco flavored e-liquids (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Flavors tested in this study yielded different patterns of nicotine delivery and led to differences in reduction in smoking urges.

For this study, 113 smokers evenly distributed across four FTC ""tar"" yield ranges were recruited, only 72 demonstrated reasonable compliance with the study criteria with regard to sample collections and cigarette brand style consistency. Subjects recorded the number of cigarettes smoked daily and collected a 24-h urine sample and a saliva sample on 3 consecutive days. Nicotine absorption was determined by monitoring urinary excretion of nicotine and its metabolites. In addition, saliva samples were monitored for cotinine using radioimmunoassay (RIA). The correlation of the relationship for nicotine absorbed per cigarette was positive and significant (r = 0.31, P = 0.008) but weaker than in the previous study. Only smokers in the highest yield range showed any statistical difference from smokers in the lower ranges. Our results suggest that FTC nicotine yield is weakly related to nicotine absorption and that smoker-controlled factors exert a great influence on the amount of nicotine absorbed by smokers. Compensation is substantial but incomplete for the minority (by market share) of smokers at the low end of the yield scale. It is uncertain how well any alternative set of machine parameters would predict nicotine absorption for the majority of smokers, even if it were more predictive for the small number of smokers at the lower yield part of the range.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

To date, however, no studies have examined whether menthol in cigarettes has central pharmacological effects. OBJECTIVE: We investigated psychophysiological and subjective effects of smoking menthol versus non-menthol cigarettes in both menthol and non-menthol smokers. To assess these effects independently of the immediate effects of nicotine, all cigarettes employed were ""denicotinized"" (FTC nicotine yield = 0.06 mg). METHODS: The psychophysiological measures were EEG and heart rate (HR). The subjective measures assessed mental alertness, muscular relaxation, anxiety/nervousness, and how much a participant wanted to smoke one of his usual brand of cigarettes. Menthol and non-menthol smokers participated in a single session in which each participant smoked both a menthol and a non-menthol denicotinized cigarette (order balanced across participants). The psychophysiological and subjective measures were recorded before and after smoking each cigarette. RESULTS: Out of 48 F-ratios spanning 22 analyses of variance involving the critical interaction between pre-/post-smoking and menthol/non-menthol cigarette, only one unambiguously fit a ""pharmacological"" pattern, a result indistinguishable from a type-I statistical error. We report evidence that menthol smokers may be chronically less aroused and more sensitive to the effects of nicotine than non-menthol smokers.

Detailed insights on nicotine use remain limited but are essential for effective prevention and intervention strategies. This study provides recent school-based data to enhance understanding of nicotine use among Dutch secondary school students. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among students from five Dutch secondary schools participating in a prevention programme (Vaping #yourchoice). Self-reported data were collected via a school-wide survey and a targeted survey among students identified by school staff as likely nicotine users. Results presented here combine data from both recruitment strategies. Measures included demographics, nicotine use patterns (e.g. age at first use, product type and frequency), perceived parental awareness, perceived addiction, quit attempts, and self-reported health complaints. Of all 978 respondents (mean age 14.5 years), 457 reported ever using nicotine of whom 90% reported past-year use. Median initiation age was 13 years. E-cigarettes were the predominant initial product (80%), followed by tobacco cigarettes (18%) and nicotine pouches (2%). Ever use was dominated by e-cigarettes (93%) and tobacco cigarettes (78%), while one-third (32%) reported ever using nicotine pouches. Nearly half (47%) of past-year users reported daily use, 70% reported dual use of e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes, the majority (77%) used nicotine during school hours, and over one-third (35%) used nicotine upon waking at night. Among these past-year users, 32% perceived parental unawareness, 41% perceived themselves as addicted, 60% reported quit attempts, of which approximately three quarters (77%) were unsuccessful, and 61% reported health complaints attributed to nicotine use. CONCLUSION: This school-based study provides detailed, real-world insights into adolescent nicotine behaviour and dependence within Dutch secondary schools. Adolescent nicotine use is characterised by frequent daily use, including dual use, use during school hours and nighttime awakenings, limited parental awareness, perceived addiction, largely unsuccessful quit attempts, and notable health complaints. These findings emphasise the urgent need for school-based cessation programmes involving parents, combined with policies to limit tobacco industry influence and reduce youth nicotine access. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Adolescent nicotine use has increased recently. • National surveys provide prevalence estimates but lack detailed data on usage patterns. WHAT IS NEW: • Frequent daily use (47%), dual use of e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes (70%), and nicotine use during nighttime awakenings (35%), together with perceived addiction (41%), quit attempts (60%), and self-reported health complaints (61%), indicate substantial nicotine dependence among adolescents. • E-cigarettes were the predominant initiation product (80%), while past-year use involved both e-cigarettes (83%) and tobacco cigarettes (74%), consistent with the gateway effect. • High school-hour use and limited perceived parental awareness highlight the need for school-based cessation interventions. • Most adolescents initiate nicotine use around age 13, often progressing to regular use, underscoring policymakers' responsibility to limit the tobacco industry's influence and reduce youth access to nicotine products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Here, we characterized tobacco root exudates (TREs) by GC-MS and nicotine, scopoletin, and octadecane were identified as three main components of TREs. Qualitative and quantitative chemotaxis assays revealed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa NXHG29 with antagonistic activity displayed positive chemotactic responses towards TREs and their three main components (nicotine, scopoletin, octadecane) and its enhanced chemotaxis were induced by these substances in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, following GC-MS and chemotaxis analysis, nicotine was selected as the target for evaluation of the effect on NXHG29 regarding antagonism, growth, root colonization and biocontrol efficiency. Results of in vitro studies showed that nicotine as a sole carbon source could enhance growth of NXHG29 and significantly increased the antagonism of NXHG29. We also demonstrated that nicotine exerted enhancing effects on the colonization ability of NXHG29 on tobacco roots by combining CLSM observations with investigation of population level dynamics by selective dilution plating method. Results from greenhouse experiments suggested nicotine exhibited stimulatory effects on the biocontrol efficiency of NXHG29 against bacterial wilt and black shank on tobacco. The stimulatory effect of nicotine was affected by the concentration and timing of nicotine application and further supported by the results of population level of NXHG29 on tobacco roots. This is the first report on the enhancement effect of nicotine from TREs on an antagonistic bacterium for its root colonization, control of soil-borne pathogens, regarding the chemotaxis and in vitro antagonism and growth.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Because of its potential functional significance, the non-synonymous variant rs1799971 (A118G, Asn40Asp) in OPRM1 has been extensively studied, yet its role in addiction has remained unclear, with conflicting association findings. To resolve the question of what effect, if any, rs1799971 has on substance dependence risk, we conducted collaborative meta-analyses of 25 datasets with over 28,000 European-ancestry subjects. We investigated non-specific risk for ""general"" substance dependence, comparing cases dependent on any substance to controls who were non-dependent on all assessed substances. We also examined five specific substance dependence diagnoses: DSM-IV alcohol, opioid, cannabis, and cocaine dependence, and nicotine dependence defined by the proxy of heavy/light smoking (cigarettes-per-day >20 vs. ≤ 10). The G allele showed a modest protective effect on general substance dependence (OR = 0.90, 95% C.I. [0.83-0.97], p value = 0.0095, N = 16,908). We observed similar effects for each individual substance, although these were not statistically significant, likely because of reduced sample sizes. We conclude that rs1799971 contributes to mechanisms of addiction liability that are shared across different addictive substances. This project highlights the benefits of examining addictive behaviors collectively and the power of collaborative data sharing and meta-analyses.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

However, the lack of strong evidence to date of a measurable, population-level effect on reducing smoking has generated skepticism about ENDS' potential benefits. This study examines whether increased US ENDS sales have been associated with reduced cigarette sales. Retail data on weekly per-capita cigarette and ENDS purchases in the USA during 2014-2019 were obtained from a national sample of brick-and-mortar retail outlets. Trends in cigarette sales were modeled before (2014-2016) ENDS had a substantial market share, and, after adjusting for macroeconomic factors, projected into the post-period (2017-2019). Actual cigarette sales were lower than projected sales (by up to 16% across the post-period), indicating a substantial ""cigarette shortfall"" in the post-period. To explore whether general (i.e., inclusive of potentially many mechanisms) substitution by ENDS can explain the cigarette shortfall, its association with per-capita ENDS volume sales was examined. Higher ENDS sales were significantly associated with a greater cigarette shortfall: for every additional per-capita ENDS unit, cigarette sales were 1.4 packs-per-capita lower than expected (B = 1.4, p < .0001). Error correction models which account for spurious correlation yielded similar results. These findings support ENDS serving as a substitute for cigarettes (through potentially many mechanisms including cigarette price), causing cigarette consumption to decline. Since ENDS potentially pose lower risk than cigarettes, this general substitution effect suggests that risk-proportionate tobacco regulation could mitigate the tobacco-related health burden.

The World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, ratified by 183 parties, includes Articles 9 and 10, which regulate the contents and emissions of tobacco products. Like many other WHO-FCTC articles, the implementation of these provisions faces significant challenges. These hurdles include tobacco industry interference, the proliferation of novel tobacco and nicotine products, the complexity of regulating product attractiveness, addictiveness, and toxicity, inadequate testing infrastructure, legal and political barriers, and coordination challenges among the regulatory authorities of different countries. Overcoming these impediments is crucial, as robust enforcement of Articles 9 and 10 holds the potential to reduce the substantial global burden of over 7 million annual deaths attributable to tobacco use. Effective implementation will require integrating these articles into domestic tobacco control legislation, establishing well-equipped testing facilities, fostering multi-sectoral coordination, and bolstering international research collaborations and capacity-building efforts. By surmounting these challenges, countries can harness the full power of the WHO-FCTC to curb the tobacco epidemic.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, little is known about neighborhood characteristics of point-of-sale (POS) e-cigarette advertising among tobacco stores. The purpose of this study was to examine socio-demographic characteristics of POS e-cigarette advertising among tobacco stores in the Omaha metropolitan area of Nebraska, USA. Between April and June 2014, trained fieldworkers completed marketing audits of all stores that sell tobacco (n = 463) in the Omaha metropolitan area and collected comprehensive e-cigarette advertising data of these stores. Based on the auditing information, we categorized tobacco stores based on e-cigarette advertising status. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between neighborhood socio-demographic factors and e-cigarette advertising among tobacco stores. 251 (54.2%) of the 463 tobacco stores had e-cigarette advertisements. We found that neighborhoods of stores with POS e-cigarette advertising had higher per capita income (p < 0.05), higher percentage of non-hispanic whites (p < 0.005), and higher percentage of individuals with high school education (p < 0.005) than neighborhoods of stores without POS e-cigarette advertising. There were negative associations between e-cigarette advertising and number of adolescents or number of middle/high school students. After adjusting for covariates, only percentage of non-Hispanic Whites remained a significant factor for e-cigarette advertising. POS e-cigarette advertising among tobacco stores is related with neighborhood socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Future studies are needed to understand how these characteristics are related with e-cigarette purchasing and e-cigarette prevalence among social groups.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The sample of the descriptive study was composed of family physicians working in 408 family health centers serving Samsun, Turkey. The data were obtained by distributing a questionnaire prepared by the researchers to volunteer family physicians during in-service trainings organized by the Samsun Provincial Directorate of Health in February and March 2019. In all, 322 (79%) family physicians who participated in the trainings were included in the study. The average age of the participating physicians was 45.0 ± 7.6 years; 61.5% of them were male. More than one third (36.0%) of family physicians said that they had never smoked, while 23.6% of them were current smokers. Most (85.0%) said that they knew what an electronic cigarette was, 94.7% of them were familiar with hookahs, and 9.0% knew about I Quit Ordinary Smoking (IQOS). It is important to inform all healthcare professionals, and especially family physicians, about those products marketed by the tobacco industry as ""less harmful"" than cigarettes. It is thought that providing appropriate counseling services to these professionals will contribute to the fight against tobacco use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Therefore, they need to be understood as cultural products invested with cognitive and emotional salience as well as nicotine delivery devices engineered to create a population of dependent users. In this paper, we look at the symbolism of cigarettes, but unlike many researchers examining this topic, we attend as much to what tobacco users do with cigarettes as to what smoking means to them cognitively. Based on interviews with low-level smokers conducted on two college campuses, we suggest that students use tobacco in order to accomplish interactional goals and to structure social time and space that would otherwise be ambiguously defined. By conceptualizing this structuring activity as play, we gain valuable insights into early stages and trajectories of tobacco use among college students. Our conceptualization of smoking as play is not meant to trivialize low-level tobacco use. Much the opposite, we caution that the contexts in which low-level smoking takes place and the utility functions of such smoking must be taken seriously by researchers in light of current increases in tobacco use among college students.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The sample for this study was drawn from the 1996 and 1999 California Tobacco Surveys. The rate of unsuccessful and successful quit attempts and the rate of abstinence were calculated for each month of the 14-month period preceding each survey administration. We combined the monthly rates for both surveys and used multiple regression modeling to test whether the proportion of smokers reporting a quit attempt and the proportion of smokers reporting abstinence increased during the period following the price increases. We included several covariates in our models to control for factors other than the price increases that could account for any increases observed in quit attempts and abstinence. Because smokers recall quits occurring closer to the date of the survey better than quits occurring further back in time, we included a term in the models representing the number of months elapsed between the survey administration and the reported quit. We also included terms in the models representing the months before and after the over-the-counter (OTC) availability of the nicotine patch and nicotine gum in 1996 to control for the increase in smoking cessation observed following the availability of OTC nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Lastly, in order to control for increased quits made in January as a result of New Year's resolutions, we included a term in our models for quit attempts and successful quits (abstinence) made during this month. Results of the regression analyses indicated a significantly greater proportion of smokers reported quit attempts (p < 0.05) in the months immediately following the cigarette price increases (after November 1998); however, a significant increase in abstinence was only observed from December 1998 through March 1999 (p < 0.05) relative to abstinence occurring before the price increases.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The fresh tobacco waste is not easily collected and transported, resulting in its centralized treatment is expensive. This study is to clarify whether it is feasible to treat fresh tobacco wastes by co-composting of them and soil in farmland and applied the obtained compost product into the soil instead of a part of tobacco-specific fertilizer. The results showed that, compared with that in original soil, the relative abundance of Pseudomonas, Azotobacter, and Coprinus of the co-composted products increased by roughly 244%, 323%, and 675%, respectively, and effective nitrogen and available potassium increased by roughly 157% and 132%, respectively. In addition, the nicotine content in co-composted products decreased dramatically compared with the discarded tobacco leaves. The application of the co-composted products and 20% fertilizer amount (15 g/plant) (YD5) exhibited the highest relative abundance of beneficial microbial communities in the soil and the best growth of tobacco plants. The co-composting of fresh tobacco waste and soil in farmland is an effective measure to treat the fresh tobacco waste, and its products increased beneficial microorganisms and stimulate the growth of tobacco plants by replacing an amount of the fertilizer.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In the present study, the feasibility of immobilization of Lipozyme TL 100L (LPZM) on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) modified poly-(GMA-co-EGDMA) (PEGDMA) was investigated for adsorption and biosorption of nicotine from aqueous solution. Characterization tests confirmed successful immobilization of lipozyme which significantly altered thermal behavior, surface characteristics, and surface morphology of PEGDMA and PEGDMA/APTES. In addition, the immobilization yields were calculated as 85.0% and 72.0% onto PEGDMA/APTES using physical adsorption and covalent immobilization methods, respectively. The nicotine removal efficiencies were calculated to be 66.4%, 79.0%, 98.9%, and 85.7%, using raw PEGDMA, PEGDMA/APTES, PEGDMA/APTES@LPZM, and PEGDMA/APTES/GU@LPZM, respectively. For the raw PEGDMA, the Langmuir isotherm was best fitted to the adsorption data, while Langmuir-Freundich model described well the adsorption process on PEGDMA/APTES and PEGDMA/APTES@LPZM. The maximum adsorption capacities of Langmuir-Freundlich model increased from 8.118 to 17.32 mg/g after enzyme immobilization. The negative enthalpy value, ΔH° (- 10.37 kJ/mol), revealed that the nicotine adsorption on PEGDMA/APTES@LPZM was exothermic in nature, which was corroborated by the decrease observed in the number of adsorbed molecules with increasing temperature. In the kinetic experiments, the adsorption on PEGDMA and PEGDMA/APTES@LPZM reached equilibrium with the removal percentages as 66.4% and 98.9% at the end of 3 h, respectively. The nicotine adsorption performances in real water matrices were also investigated, and PEGDMA/APTES@LPZM showed satisfactory reusability with removal percentage decreased from 98.9% (1st cycle) to 83.0% (6th cycle).","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, cigarette smoke contains thousands of harmful components, and the effects of only tar and nicotine cannot be used to represent TSP. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of cigarette grade/price and size on TSP by measuring PM2.5 concentrations for three different grades/prices and two sizes of popular cigarettes in China. The results showed that cigarette grade/price did not significantly affect PM2.5 levels in regular (R) or slim (S) cigarettes in either sidestream or mainstream smoke. However, cigarette size had a significant effect on PM2.5 levels, with R cigarette PM2.5 being 116% higher than S cigarette PM2.5 in sidestream smoke. In mainstream smoke, this difference decreased to 31%, although R-cigarette PM2.5 levels remained higher. While S cigarette PM2.5 levels were lower than those of R cigarettes, this did not necessarily mean that S cigarettes were less harmful. The harmfulness of smoke is not only manifested in PM2.5 but also in other particulate matter such as PM10 and PM1.0. At the same time, it is also affected by smoking habits. Therefore, further experiments are required to evaluate the potential harmfulness of S cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study aims to determine the effects of prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) on brain metabolite levels in young (3-4 years old) children, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS). Twenty-six children with PNE and 24 nicotine-unexposed children (controls) were evaluated with a structured examination, a battery of neuropsychological tests, and MRI/(1)H MRS (without sedation). Concentrations of N-acetyl compounds (NA), total creatine (tCR), choline-containing compounds (CHO), myo-inositol (MI), and glutamate+glutamine (GLX) were measured in four brain regions. Children with PNE had similar performance to controls on neuropsychological testing. However, compared to controls, the PNE group had lower MI (repeated measures ANOVA-p = 0.03) and tCr levels (repeated measures ANOVA-p = 0.003), especially in the basal ganglia of the girls (-19.3%, p = 0.01). In contrast, GLX was elevated in the anterior cingulate cortex of the PNE children (+9.4%, p = 0.03), and those with the highest GLX levels had the poorest performance on vocabulary (r = -0.67; p < 0.001) and visual motor integration (r = -0.53; p = 0.01). The amount of prenatal nicotine exposure did not correlate with metabolite concentrations. These findings suggest that PNE may lead to subclinical abnormalities in glial development, especially in the basal ganglia, and regionally specific changes in other neurometabolites. These alterations were not influenced by the amount of nicotine exposure prenatally. However, the effects of PNE on energy metabolism may be sex specific, with greater alterations in girls.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

OBJECTIVE: To identify baseline smoker characteristics beyond the history of mental illness that predict which participants were more likely to experience moderate to severe NPSAEs in EAGLES. DESIGN: A prospective correlational cohort study in the context of a multinational, multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial. PARTICIPANTS: Smokers without (N = 3984; NPC)/with (N = 4050; PC) histories of, or current clinically stable, psychiatric disorders including mood (N = 2882; 71%), anxiety (N = 782; 19%), and psychotic (N = 386; 10%) disorders. INTERVENTIONS: Bupropion, 150 mg twice daily, or varenicline, 1 mg twice daily, versus active control (nicotine patch, 21 mg/day with taper) and placebo for 12 weeks with 12-week non-treatment follow-up. MAIN MEASURES: Primary safety outcome was the incidence of a composite measure of moderate/severe NPSAEs. Associations among baseline demographic/clinical characteristics and the primary safety endpoint were analyzed post hoc via generalized linear regression. KEY RESULTS: The incidence of moderate to severe NPSAEs was higher among smokers in the PC (238/4050; 5.9%) than in the NPC (84/3984; 2.1%). Three baseline characteristics predicted increased risk for experiencing clinically significant NPSAEs when quitting regardless of carrying a psychiatric diagnosis: current symptoms of anxiety (for every ~ 4-unit increase in HADS anxiety score, the absolute risk of occurrence of the NPSAE endpoint increased by 1% in both PC and NPC); prior history of suicidal ideation and/or behavior (PC, 4.4% increase; P = 0.001; NPC, 4.1% increase; P = 0.02), and being of White race (versus Black: PC, 2.9% ± 0.9 [SE] increase; P = 0.002; and NPC, 3.4% ± 0.8 [SE] increase; P = 0.001). Among smokers with psychiatric disorders, younger age, female sex, history of substance use disorders, and proxy measures of nicotine dependence or psychiatric illness severity also predicted greater risk. There were no significant interactions between these characteristics and treatment. Smokers with unstable psychiatric disorders or with current, active substance abuse were excluded from the study. CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of cessation pharmacotherapy use, smokers attempting to quit were more likely to experience moderate to severe NPSAEs if they reported current anxiety or prior suicidal ideation at baseline and were White. In smokers with a psychiatric history, female sex, younger age, and greater severity of nicotine dependence were also predictive.

A randomised, open-label, cross-over clinical study was conducted in 15 healthy US adult smokers. Five different e-cigarette products were evaluated consecutively on different days after use of own brand conventional cigarette. Plasma nicotine pharmacokinetics, subjective effects, and tolerability were assessed following controlled use of the products. The rate of nicotine absorption into the bloodstream was comparable from all e-cigarettes tested and was as rapid as that for conventional cigarette. However, in all cases, nicotine delivery did not exceed that of the conventional cigarette. The pharmacokinetic profiles of nicotine salt emissions were also dependent upon the properties of the e-cigarette device. Subjective scores were numerically highest after smoking a conventional cigarette followed by the myblu 40-mg nicotine salt formulation. The rise in nicotine blood levels following use of all the tested e-cigarettes was quantified as 'a little' to 'modestly' satisfying at relieving the desire to smoke. All products were well tolerated with no notable adverse events reported. These results demonstrate that, while delivering less nicotine than a conventional cigarette, the use of nicotine salts in e-cigarettes enables cigarette-like pulmonary delivery of nicotine that reduces desire to smoke.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Imperial Brands'],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

This randomized, multi-centre, controlled clinical study will test the hypotheses that following a switch from combustible cigarettes to a THP for 1 year, participants will experience a sustained reduction in exposure to tobacco-related toxicants that will lead to favourable changes in health effect indicators associated with smoking-related disease development. Changes in such indicators will be contextualized against smoking cessation and never-smoker cohorts. Up to 280 participants who do not intend to quit smoking will be randomized to continued combustible smoking (arm A, up to n = 80) or a commercially available THP (arm B n = 200). Furthermore, up to 190 participants with a high intent to quit smoking will undergo smoking cessation (arm D), and 40 never smokers will serve as a control group (arm E). Recruitment numbers were determined to be sufficient to achieve n = 50 in arms A, B and D, at study end. Enrolment started in March 2018 and the trial is scheduled to be completed in March 2020. Data from this study will be a valuable addition to the growing body of evidence in the field of understanding the individual and public health impact of THPs.Clinical Trial Registration: https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN81075760.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['British American Tobacco'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The never smoker group typically had lower levels of the measured BoEs than either of these groups, and much lower levels than participants who continued to smoke. Several BoPHs were found to change in a favourable direction (towards never smoker levels) over the year study for participants who completely switched to THP or quit, while BoPHs such as soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 were found to change in an unfavourable direction (away from never smoker levels) in participants who continued to smoke. Our findings, alongside chemical and toxicological studies undertaken on the THP used in this study, lead to the conclusion that smokers who would have otherwise continued to smoke and instead switch entirely to the use of this THP, will reduce their exposure to tobacco smoke toxicants and as a consequence are reasonably likely to reduce disease risks compared to those continuing to smoke.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Yes,Yes,['British American Tobacco'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Nationally representative Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey data from the 2022 National Health Interview Survey (N = 27,651) were used to analyze populations of US adults who self-reported having stopped smoking cigarettes for 6 months or longer in the last year and the methods they used, or who did not stop smoking but tried in the last year (N = 1735). In 2022, an estimated 2.9 million [95% CI 2.5 million-3.2 million] US adults had stopped smoking in the past year. Most were male, non-Hispanic White, aged < 55 years, college-educated, identified as straight, were not depressed, and currently drank alcohol. The most popular methods used to stop smoking were nicotine products (53.9% [47.4-60.3%]; 1.5 [1.3-1.8] million adults), especially e-cigarettes in combination with other methods (40.8% [34.4-47.5%]; 1.2 [0.9-1.4] million) and e-cigarettes alone (26.0% [20.4-32.3%]; 0.7 [0.6-0.9] million).

This Points of View article considers the effectiveness of MPOWER and questions the feasibility of nicotine eradication as a public health goal. Drawing on global and regional smoking prevalence data, we argue that the exclusive focus on cessation of nicotine use has reached diminishing returns. In contrast, countries where people who smoke have embraced safer nicotine products such as e-cigarettes, heated tobacco, and oral nicotine have seen accelerated reductions in smoking. We highlight the ethical and practical implications and propose an updated approach to tobacco control that incorporates harm reduction into FCTC governance, enabling clinicians and public health practitioners to provide cessation and risk-reduction advice tailored to individual needs. The issues raised in this article are particularly relevant for internists and general practitioners who encounter the clinical consequences of smoking every day in primary care and internal medicine settings. As the article highlights, without reform, the global target of meaningfully reducing the number of people who smoke will remain out of reach this century. A shift toward pragmatic, science-based strategies is urgently needed to reduce the global burden of smoking-related disease. By framing smoking not only as a public health challenge but also as a pressing clinical concern, the paper underscores the importance of integrating harm reduction perspectives into everyday patient care.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

The purpose of this study is to examine factors associated with smoking among LGBTQI + cancer survivors during the pandemic. METHODS: We used a secondary data analysis of OUT: The National Cancer Survey. We conducted logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between psychological distress, binge drinking, and socio-demographic factors with ever use and current use of cigarettes, other tobacco, and nicotine products. RESULTS: Of the 1629 participants in our sample, 53% used in their lifetime and 13% reported current use. Correlates of increased ever use included being of older age (AOR = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.03) and binge drinking (AOR = 2.47; 95% CI: 1.17, 5.20) while correlates of decreased ever use were among those with a graduate or professional degree (AOR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.71). Correlates of increased current use included being of Latine descent (AOR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.07, 3.36), binge drinking (AOR = 3.18; 95% CI: 1.56, 6.48), without health insurance (AOR = 2.37; 95% CI: 1.10, 5.10), and being disabled (AOR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.26) while correlates of decreased current use were among cisgender women (AOR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.77), being of younger age (AOR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96, 0.99), and having a graduate or professional degree (AOR = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that a proportion of LGBTQI + cancer survivors continue to smoke during the pandemic despite the increased risk involved with smoking. Furthermore, individuals with intersecting marginalized identities experience additional stressors that may have been further exacerbated by the conditions of the pandemic that encourage them to smoke. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Quitting smoking after a cancer diagnosis can decrease the chances of recurrence and a new primary malignancy. In addition, practitioners and researchers should advocate towards examining and addressing systemic forms of oppression in institutions that LGBTQI + cancer survivors navigate during the pandemic.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

As a consequence of the First Surgeon General's Report on Tobacco in 1964, tobacco control interventions on part of the government led to a significant decline in conventional tobacco product usage over the last few decades. However, more recently, a new entity in the form of electronic cigarettes has risen rapidly and has exposed a younger population to a plethora of dangerous consequences. Looking at e-cigarettes from the perspective of tobacco control however raises a lot of challenges. There is little doubt that existing smokers of combustible cigarettes who switch to e-cigarettes will be switching to a less harmful product. However, if the younger generation begins using e-cigarettes as a result of targeted marketing, appealing flavors and 'safer alternative' perception, decades of progress made in conventional tobacco control will be negated. Governments at the federal, state, and local levels have a mandate to once again implement new public health policies to ensure that non-conventional tobacco products like e-cigarettes are available as smoking cessation tools for existing smokers but at the same time do not play a role in ruining the health of future generations through addiction and disease. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the present scenario of regulations and policies impacting public health with respect to electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) with the objective of providing a meaningful and balanced view of the challenges at hand with plausible recommendations. RECENT FINDINGS: Nicotine in tobacco is known to cause addiction and dependence. It is particularly potent in children and young adults. E-cigarettes can deliver high concentrations of nicotine, and these concentrations can vary depending on the numerous constituents within the e-cigarette which vary greatly from one another. Use of e-cigarettes is implicated as a risk factor for future cigarette use in young adults. Moreover, e-cigarette usage patterns also depend on several sociodemographic factors. Banning tobacco products has shown to reduce smoking risk in youth and as such, strong e-cigarette regulation measures are needed for prevention. Effective regulation of ENDS faces a multitude of challenges. One such challenge is to prevent youth and non-smokers from getting habituated to nicotine through e-cigarettes. The intention of tobacco companies to sustain sales through harmful marketing strategies that tone down the risks and highlight e-cigarettes as a ""much safer alternative"" while promoting flavors appealing to children should be immediately prohibited. Another hazard is the endorsement of ENDS as devices meant for enhancing social interaction which opens a path for youth to make erroneous choices under peer pressure. On the other hand, several studies have reported that e-cigarettes significantly reduce an existing smoker's risk of being exposed to toxic tobacco smoke constituents that are normally present in cigarette smoke. This leads to the conclusions that e-cigarettes can be a tool for smoking cessation for current smokers. Public policy must take a multi-dimensional approach to balance these two extremes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Butt litter as an environmental and public health hazard is a relatively new field of study, but recent research and findings have clear global implications. While this article focuses specifically on the situation in Australia, where cigarette butts are consistently the most littered item identified in national clean-up campaigns, the material reviewed has clear international environmental implications. The article first reviews existing literature on filter composition and toxicology, clean-up costs, regulatory response, and key policy actors. It then describes the scale of the butt litter problem in Australia using existing data, and analyses potential remedies at both the domestic and international levels.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

With 8 million deaths worldwide annually, smoking remains one of the major causes of disability and premature death. However, nicotine also plays an important role in smoking cessation strategies. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive, whole-body, physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) model of nicotine and its major metabolite cotinine, covering various routes of nicotine administration, and to simulate nicotine brain tissue concentrations after the use of combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes, nicotine gums, and nicotine patches. METHODS: A parent-metabolite, PBPK/PD model of nicotine for a non-smoking and a smoking population was developed using 91 plasma and brain tissue concentration-time profiles and 11 heart rate profiles. Among others, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2A6 and 2B6 enzymes were implemented, including kinetics for CYP2A6 poor metabolizers. RESULTS: The model is able to precisely describe and predict both nicotine plasma and brain tissue concentrations, cotinine plasma concentrations, and heart rate profiles. 100% of the predicted area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) values meet the twofold acceptance criterion with overall geometric mean fold errors of 1.12 and 1.15, respectively. The administration of combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes, nicotine patches, and nicotine gums was successfully implemented in the model and used to identify differences in steady-state nicotine brain tissue concentration patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Our PBPK/PD model may be helpful in further investigations of nicotine dependence and smoking cessation strategies. As the model represents the first nicotine PBPK/PD model predicting nicotine concentration and heart rate profiles after the use of e-cigarettes, it could also contribute to a better understanding of the recent increase in youth e-cigarette use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

METHODS: In combination with TOB, nicotine toxicity and diffusion across human mucosal cells were measured using a 3-D human mucosal tissue model. RESULTS: Nicotine was delivered 2.1 times more quickly in combination with TOB than in combination with saline (p < 0.05). Despite the increased diffusion, nicotine in combination with TOB significantly increased mucosal cell survival (p < 0.05) by reducing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytoplasm when compared with nicotine without TOB. The average percentage distribution of cytochrome c in the cytosolic fraction over time of nicotine + 79% ethyl alcohol (ETOH) versus nicotine plus TOB (79% ETOH) was significantly different over 120 min (60.0 ± 29.9% cytosol, 16.1 ± 9.4% cytosol, p = 0.03). Related to the reduction of cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm, TOB suppressed caspase-3 and -9 activity, thereby preventing intrinsic apoptosis and providing cytoprotection of the mucosal cells (ETOH + nicotine vs ETOH + nicotine + TOB: p = 0.008 for caspase 3, p < 0.001 for caspase 9). CONCLUSION: Two hours of TOB (17-24% benzoin, 79% ETOH) plus nicotine promotes diffusion of nicotine across human mucosal cells and simultaneously prevents human mucosal cell toxicity by inhibiting cytochrome c release into the cytosol, thereby preventing caspase 3 and 9 activity and subsequent intrinsic apoptosis.",['Nicotine/NRT'],Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

AIMS: This study compared the impact of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes (EC+) versus nicotine-free (EC-) on BP, HR and endothelial markers, and assessed if EC+ posed fewer risks than tobacco cigarettes (TC). METHODS: Electronic databases were searched from inception until November 2023 for studies reporting changes in systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP) and HR and endothelial parameters before and after the use of EC+, EC- and TC. Data were analyzed using weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Fifteen studies (n = 752) were included in our meta-analysis. We demonstrate that EC+ significantly increased systolic BP (WMD = 3.41, 95% CI [0.1,6.73], p = 0.04], diastolic BP (WMD = 3.42, 95% CI [1.75, 5.09]; p < 0.01], and HR (WMD = 5.36 BPM, 95% CI [1.87, 8.85]; p < 0.01) compared to EC-. However, EC+ was observed to cause less detrimental effect on SBP (WMD = - 4.72 mmHg, 95% CI [- 6.58, - 2.86], p < 0.01), and HR (WMD = - 3.11 BPM, 95% CI [- 4.54, - 1.68]; p < 0.01) as compared to TC with no difference on DBP (WMD = - 1.14 mmHg, 95% CI [- 2.38, 0.1]; p = 0.07). EC+ also led to greater deterioration of endothelial parameters as compared to EC- but to a lesser degree as compared to TC. CONCLUSION: EC+ shows greater impairment in hemodynamic and endothelial parameters than EC- but less than TC.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of E-cigarettes on the oral microbiome and to describe the difference of oral community profiles between E-cigarette smokers and tobacco smokers. 16S rRNA V4 gene sequencing was performed to investigate the oral microbial profiles of 5 E-cigarette smokers, 14 tobacco smokers, 8 quitting tobacco smokers, and 6 nonsmokers. The Chao1, ACE, and Shannon diversity indexes increased significantly in saliva samples collected from E-cigarette smokers and tobacco smokers compared to the non-smokers, and no significant difference was found in alpha diversity between E-cigarette smokers and tobacco smokers. The main phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria and major genera Neisseria, Streptococcus, Prevotellaceae, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas dominated in the smoking groups, while Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria became the dominant phyla along with the genera Corynebacterium, Neisseria, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, and Porphyromonas in the nonsmokers. The differences in the phylum Actinobacteria and genus Corynebacterium contributed to various functional differences between smokers and nonsmokers. The difference on oral microbial and composition between E-cigarettes and common tobacco were associated with increased Prevotellaceae and decreased Neisseria. Additionally, smoking cessation could lead to re-establishment of the oral microbiome to that of nonsmokers. Our data demonstrate that E-cigarette smoking had different effects on the structure and composition of the oral microbial community compared to tobacco smoking. However, the short- and long-term impact of E-cigarette smoking on microbiome composition and function needs further exploration.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The objective of this study was to determine whether the absence of mutagenic activity observed in the in vitro assays would be reflected in the urine of smokers of the test cigarette. 72 subjects (31 smokers and 41 non-smokers) were enrolled in a 6-week study, with the smokers randomly divided into 2 groups. The study was designed as a double crossover, with each smoker smoking both test (tobacco-heating) and reference (tobacco-burning) cigarettes. This design allowed each smoker to serve as his or her own control while at the same time allowing comparisons between groups of non-smokers and smokers of both test and reference cigarettes. 24-h urine samples were collected twice a week and concentrated using XAD-2 resin. Urine concentrates were tested in Ames bacterial strains TA98 and TA100, with and without metabolic activation and with and without beta-glucuronidase/aryl sulfatase. Individuals who smoked the test cigarette voided urine which was significantly less mutagenic than that voided when they smoked reference cigarettes. The mutagenicity of urine from smokers who smoked the test cigarette and non-smokers did not differ under any of the assay conditions used in this study.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Diet and cigarette smoking have both been reported to affect the mutagenicity of human urine, but the relationship between smoking status and the expression of diet-related urinary mutagenicity is unknown. It has been reported that some promutagens are more active in in vitro assays when tested in the presence of urine from smokers than when tested in the presence of urine from non-smokers. We aimed to determine whether the differences in urinary mutagenicity between smokers and non-smokers result from increased urinary mutagenicity from dietary heterocyclic amine mutagens in smokers compared with non-smokers. Groups of smokers and non-smokers (6-12) were given identical diets, previously shown to be low in heterocyclic amines and very low in mutagenicity. The diet consisted exclusively of raw food and of food cooked in boiling water. After a 2-day dietary stabilization period, 24-hour urine samples were collected for three consecutive days. The regimen was repeated in the following week. For comparison, both groups were also placed on a ""western"" diet, consisting of a variety of foods prepared by several cooking methods, designed to reflect what a typical United States family might consume. Urine was concentrated using XAD-2 resin and then assayed for mutagenic activity in the Ames test. The urine of smokers was significantly more mutagenic than that of non-smokers when on both the raw/boiled and the ""western"" diets. These results indicate that the increased urinary mutagenicity observed in smokers compared with non-smokers is not due to enhanced mutagenicity of diet-related heterocyclic amine mutagens in the urine of smokers.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Dietary nicotine would give rise to cotinine in urine and compromise estimates of exposure to tobacco smoke that depend on urinary cotinine. All foods were homogenized, extracted and analysed for nicotine and cotinine by gas chromatography with nitrogen-sensitive detection (GC) and/or GC/MS (mass spectrometry). Weak acid and aqueous extracts of the teas were analysed in a similar manner. Nicotine was not detected (less than 1 ng/ml of extract) in egg plant or green pepper. The average values for nicotine in tomato and potato were 7.3 ng/g wet weight and 15 ng/g wet weight, respectively. Black teas, including regular and decaffeinated brands, had nicotine contents ranging from non-detectable to greater than 100 ng/g wet weight. Instant teas yielded the highest nicotine contents observed (up to 285 ng/g wet weight). The possible sources of nicotine in these foods are discussed. A range of potential values for urinary cotinine concentrations (0.6 to 6.2 ng/ml) was calculated based upon estimated average and maximal consumptions of these foods and beverages. Because of the potential for exposure to nicotine by way of these routes, the use of urinary cotinine as a biomarker of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke may be compromised.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The issue of cigarette flavor has received a great deal of study by cigarette manufacturers but relatively little by academic investigators. The paucity of literature is particularly acute in terms of the importance of flavor in cigarette substitutes, which are used to help people to reduce or quit smoking. In the current study, five different types of flavors added to a plastic cigarette substitute were assessed in experienced smokers. There were two menthol-like flavors and three tobacco-like flavors. Two groups of smokers were tested: menthol smokers and ""regular"" (non-menthol) smokers. Both types of smokers liked the two menthol flavors significantly more than placebo and rated the menthol flavors and the cigarette flavor as significantly more satisfying than placebo. Craving was differentially reduced in the two groups of smokers. Menthol smokers showed a small reduction in craving with the placebo, with a significant enhancement of this reduction seen with the addition of the ""EZ Quit"" menthol flavor.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

DESIGN: Item Response Theory (IRT) is used to analyze the Health Information National Trends Survey sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration (HINTS-FDA). The survey was fielded in 2015. IRT allows the pattern of product use to be described and help assess whether the new tobacco products (i.e., e-cigarettes, hookahs) serve as gateway to other products or act in harm reduction modality. FINDINGS: The results indicate that the new product alternatives have changed the how tobacco products are adopted in the U.S. In particular, younger respondents were more likely to have engaged in cigar, e-cigarette and water-pipe use than the older cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of nicotine products previously unavailable in the U.S is creating new modes for smoking initiation in the age groups most likely to begin a new habit. There is little evidence that smokers in the older HINTS cohorts are using the e-cigarette as a smoking cessation tool. The rise of cigar use in the younger cohort may indicate that legal products are being mixed with illicit substances (i.e., 'blunting').","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Smoking is associated with unemployment and a harder time finding re-employment. The current study examined job-seekers' prioritization of smoking over other discretionary items. METHODS: Adult, unemployed job-seekers smoking daily ranked items from 1 (highest) to 13 (lowest) for prioritization of their discretionary spending. The online survey randomly ordered the presentation of items. The Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI, time to first cigarette and cigarettes per day) assessed severity of nicotine addiction. RESULTS: The sample (N = 290) was 70% men, 42% African American and 30% non-Hispanic Caucasian, with mean age of 43 (SD = 11), smoking an average of 12 cigarettes per day (SD = 6), and 67% smoking within 30 min of waking. Overall, cigarettes (M = 4.7, SD = 3.1) ranked second in importance behind only food (M = 2.5, SD = 2.7); 45% of the sample ranked tobacco in their top 3 spending priorities, and 26% ranked cigarettes as a higher priority than food. Cellular charges, transportation, grooming, and clothing ranked third through sixth, respectively. Higher HSI scores significantly correlated with greater prioritization of cigarettes (r = -0.25), and lower prioritization of food (r = 0.16) and transportation (r = 0.13), p's < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate cigarettes were highly prioritized, second only to food among job-seekers who smoke. Cigarettes were prioritized over job-seeking resources and health care, particularly among those who were more heavily addicted. Tobacco addiction can preempt basic life needs and reduce resources for finding re-employment.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Nicotine in e-cigarettes, as well as vaping behaviour, may support smoking cessation by reducing weight gain. This study explored the factors that influence attitudes towards, and awareness of, e-cigarettes and weight control post smoking cessation. METHODS: Qualitative study involving focus groups with adults in the UK (n = 58) who were either exclusive vapers or dual users. RESULTS: There was limited awareness and/or inclination to vape to prevent weight gain after stopping smoking. Reasons for this centred on: the health gains of stopping smoking outweighing any potential weight gain; a lack of understanding of the appetite supressing effects of nicotine; a belief that vaping could not suppress appetite like a cigarette and could result in craving for certain flavours; concerns about the longer-term effects of e-cigarettes on health and the ethics of promoting vaping as way to support smoking cessation by limiting weight gain, especially for young women. CONCLUSION: Participants in this study do not appear inclined to use e-cigarettes to prevent weight gain after smoking cessation. There is a lack of understanding about why nicotine might help prevent weight gain and a concern that e-cigarette flavours could provoke cravings and that vaping may be unsafe in the long-term.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Longitudinal study of smokers in the US using the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) waves 1 to 5.,"INTRODUCTION: Most adult cigarette smokers have tried unsuccessfully to quit. We followed participants in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study through five waves (2013-2019), comparing smoking, quit behaviors and other characteristics between persistent smokers and those who became and stayed former smokers. METHODS: The main analysis employed treatment effects to estimate mean differences in smoking and quitting behaviors among smoker groups. Logistic models were used to estimate predicted means based on continuing smokers' demographic characteristics to ensure that any differences in outcomes did not come from differences in demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Among smokers enrolled in PATH Wave 1, 68 % persisted in all subsequent waves. Compared with smokers who quit after Wave 1, persistent smokers had remarkably stable smoking behaviors, including significantly higher proportions of everyday smokers, consuming 10+ cigarettes per day, and smoking within 30 min of waking up. Persistent smokers were also less likely to try to quit completely, and experienced more negative symptoms from nicotine withdrawal. They also showed less interest in quitting and were less confident of being successful than smokers who quit by the next wave. Neither electronic nicotine delivery systems nor menthol played a role in continued smoking or quitting. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics and behaviors of persistent smokers in this study were stable over five waves of data collection during a six-year period, suggesting that these smokers need new cessation options.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

The term TFN and claims about its properties can mislead consumers about the harms and addictiveness of TFN e-cigarettes, which may increase initiation of these products among non-smokers or influence current smokers' decisions to adopt TFN e-cigarettes as a harm reduction measure. METHODS: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional survey of 777 adolesc aged 13-17 and 655 current adult cigarette smokers residing in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, or Vermont about their TFN e-cigarette awareness, use, perceptions, and susceptibility. We examined the association between prior awareness of TFN and use, perceptions, and susceptibility. RESULTS: One-third of adolescents and adults reported being aware of TFN. TFN e-cigarette use was less common than tobacco-derived nicotine (TDN) e-cigarette use among adolescents (8.9 % vs. 30.5 %) and adults (21.1 % vs. 79.4 %). Compared to unaware adolescents, adolescents who were aware of TFN more frequently reported being more likely to use TFN compared to TDN e-cigarettes and that TFN e-cigarettes are more addictive than those containing TDN. Aware adult smokers more frequently reported that TFN e-cigarettes are more addictive than TDN e-cigarettes, TFN e-cigarettes cause some harm, TDN e-cigarettes cause little harm, and that TFN and TDN e-cigarettes are equally harmful than those who were unaware previously. CONCLUSION: Public health education campaigns are needed to educate consumers about the harms and addictiveness of TFN e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We used descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models to assess cross-sectionally risk perceptions for severe Covid-19 symptoms and their health behaviour correlates among 2206 UK adults from the HEBECO study. The great majority (89-99%) classified age 70+, having comorbidities, being a key worker, overweight, and from an ethnic minority as increasing the risk. People were less sure about alcohol drinking, vaping, and nicotine replacement therapy use (17.4-29.5% responding 'don't know'). Relative to those who did not, those who engaged in the following behaviours had higher odds of classifying these behaviours as (i) decreasing the risk: smoking cigarettes (adjusted odds ratios, aORs, 95% CI = 2.26, 1.39-3.37), and using e-cigarettes (aORs = 5.80, 3.25-10.34); (ii) having no impact: smoking cigarettes (1.98; 1.42-2.76), using e-cigarettes (aORs = 2.63, 1.96-3.50), drinking alcohol (aORs = 1.75, 1.31-2.33); and lower odds of classifying these as increasing the risk: smoking cigarettes (aORs: 0.43, 0.32-0.56), using e-cigarettes (aORs = 0.25, 0.18-0.35). Similarly, eating more fruit and vegetables was associated with classifying unhealthy diet as 'increasing risk' (aOR = 1.37, 1.12-1.69), and exercising more with classifying regular physical activity as 'decreasing risk' (aOR = 2.42, 1.75-3.34). Risk perceptions for severe Covid-19 among UK adults were lower for their own health behaviours, evidencing optimism bias. These risk perceptions may form barriers to changing people's own unhealthy behaviours, make them less responsive to interventions that refer to the risk of Covid-19 as a motivating factor, and exacerbate inequalities in health behaviours and outcomes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Undergraduates (N=424) rated 12 brands of cigarettes on multiple attributes based on manufacturer advertisements. This paper focused on two brands with flavored and non-flavored versions (Camel and Salem). Despite brand, regular smokers and those susceptible to smoking initiation had higher positive expectancies and lower negative expectancies about smoking than nonsmokers. Flavored cigarettes elicited higher positive expectancies than non-flavored counterparts across all groups, including nonsmokers. Indeed, the degree to which flavored Camels had higher positive expectancies than Camel Lights was at least as large in a group of susceptible nonsmokers and experimenters (susceptible/experimenters). Despite being present in nonsmokers and susceptible/experimenters, negative expectancies were significantly lower for flavored versus non-flavored brands. Logistic regressions revealed that positive expectancies predicted ""intention to try"" each brand for regular smokers and susceptible/experimenters.

Although TID beliefs have been noted in adult smokers and associated with intent to quit, research has not evaluated whether they are affected by smokers' level of nicotine dependence. The present article sought to concurrently examine how attitudes towards the tobacco industry and tobacco control groups may differ among smokers of varying levels of nicotine dependence. In addition, it evaluated how these attitudes and beliefs may be associated with smokers' intentions to reduce or quit smoking. METHODS: A random digit dialing telephone survey was conducted of 889 Canadian current daily smokers, 18 years and older. RESULTS: Attitudes towards the tobacco industry were mixed among the entire cohort and differences in beliefs towards the tobacco industry were not found among smokers of varying levels of nicotine dependence. However, smokers that held strong TID beliefs were 5 times more intent to quit smoking than those without such beliefs. Compared to smokers with low level of nicotine dependence, heavy smokers were more likely to report strong overall displeasure with the tobacco control community (OR=1.98, 95% CI=1.23-3.19, p=0.005), however there were no differences with regards to future intent to quit. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of strong negative sentiment toward the tobacco industry among smokers as a whole suggests that more targeted anti-industry messages are needed, raising greater awareness of tobacco industry practices within smokers and non-smokers alike. As heavier smokers' discontent with the tobacco control community highlights increasing social disapproval and pressure to quit smoking, future educational and media strategies used for smoking cessation purposes may benefit from emphasizing more of the positive attributes associated with quitting smoking, as opposed to the negative features of smoking itself.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

The majority of participants correctly identified smoking as being a potential cause of various smoking-related conditions and correctly identified constituents in cigarette smoke. However, a majority of participants also misattributed nicotine as being a potential cause of smoking-related illness. Accurate knowledge about nicotine was low. These misperceptions are of particular concern for vulnerable populations, such as persons living with HIV, who are disproportionately burdened by the prevalence of smoking and associated morbidities and mortality. These misperceptions could have unintended consequences in the wake of a potential nicotine reduction policy, such that reduced nicotine content products are perceived as safer than normal nicotine content products currently available for sale. Additionally, incorrect knowledge about nicotine has implications for the uptake and continued use of nicotine replacement therapy.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study aimed to determine the feasibility and reliability of a mobile application for the measurement of tobacco and e-cigarette marketing and message exposure using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). METHODS: Young adults from Austin, TX (n=181, ages 18-29) were instructed to use a mobile application to record all sightings of marketing or social media related to tobacco (including e-cigarettes) in real-time for 28days (Event EMAs). Tobacco product use and recall of message encounters were assessed daily using an app-initiated EMA (Daily EMAs). RESULTS: The mobile app was a feasible and acceptable method to measure exposure to tobacco messages. The majority of messages (45.0%) were seen on the Internet, and many were user-generated. Thirty-day recall of messages at baseline was poorly correlated with messages reported via Event EMA during the study period; however, the correlation between post-study 30-day recall and Event EMA was much stronger (r=0.603 for industry-sponsored messages, r=0.599 for user-generated messages). Correlations between Daily EMAs and 30-day recall of message exposure (baseline and post-study) were small (baseline: r=0.329-0.389) to large (post-study: r=0.656-0.766). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that EMA is a feasible and reliable method for measuring tobacco message exposure, especially given the prevalence of messages encountered online and on social media. Recall measures are limited in their ability to accurately represent marketing exposure, but might be improved by a period of priming or clearer response categories.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: In a smoking cessation clinical trial of varenicline, we compared pill counts collected over 4 different time periods to varenicline salivary levels taken after 2weeks of treatment, as well as evaluated predictors of adherence to varenicline. RESULTS: Using a binary measure of adherence based on salivary varenicline levels, adherence was higher among older, white, and more educated participants. Relative to 3, 7, and 14-day pill count, 12-week pill count was the only significant measure able to discriminate adherence as defined by salivary varenicline levels (assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; AUC=0.59, p=0.004). Seventy-two percent of participants who indicated adherence on 12-week pill count were classified as adherent based on varenicline saliva levels (sensitivity=0.80; specificity=0.40). There was modest variability in the relationship between 12-week pill count and varenicline levels across race and rate of nicotine metabolism. Lastly, General Estimating Equation models demonstrated that longitudinal changes in withdrawal, craving, negative and positive affect, and side effect count and severity were not related to adherence based on salivary varenicline levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that 12-week pill count was the best, albeit a relatively weak, measure of varenicline adherence; additional factors associated with treatment adherence need to be identified.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Although tobacco company websites are ostensibly targeted to adults, some youth access these websites and are exposed to tobacco-related content. METHODS: This study analyzed data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) survey to estimate the prevalence of exposure to tobacco websites and the associations between website exposure and tobacco product use and susceptibility among adolescents in the United States. RESULTS: Although only 2.3% of youth had ever visited a tobacco company website, youth who visited tobacco company websites were 3.2 times more likely to have used cigarettes and 3.0 times more likely to have used e-cigarettes in the past month, relative to those who had not visited a tobacco website. Among never-users, those who had visited tobacco company websites were 2.4 times more likely to be susceptible to cigarettes and 2.9 times more likely to be susceptible to e-cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that more effective regulations are needed to prevent youth from accessing tobacco websites. Stricter age verification procedures on websites could minimize exposure to tobacco websites by youth.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This pilot study investigated the effects of asking smokers to switch to e-cigs for 6weeks on smoking, exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) concentration, dependence, and motivation to quit smoking. METHODS: Non-treatment seeking daily smokers (n=18) were given free e-cigs and instructed to use them instead of smoking cigarettes for 6weeks. Smokers were assessed at baseline, weekly for 6weeks, and at 8 and 10weeks for cigarettes/day, e-cig use, CO, cigarette dependence, and Contemplation Ladder. RESULTS: All participants completed 6weeks; 17 completed 10weeks. At Week 6, cigarettes/day were reduced by two-thirds and CO by 45% from baseline (p's<.001), with reductions maintained at Week 10 (p's<.005). Cigarette dependence scores were a third lower at Weeks 6 (p<.002) and 10 (p<.001) than at baseline. Contemplation Ladder scores were higher at Weeks 6 and 10 (p's<.001) than at baseline. All these statistical effect sizes were large. At Week 6, number of reasons not to use e-cigs increased (p<.011). CONCLUSIONS: Results show preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of short-term switching to e-cigs by non-treatment seeking smokers in terms of reduced smoke toxicant exposure and cigarette dependence, and increased motivation to quit, all maintained at least 4weeks after free e-cigs were no longer provided.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

We assess whether these populations report more engagement with online tobacco marketing compared with heterosexual and non-Hispanic white youth. METHODS: Data were from 8015 adolescents sampled between 2014 and 2015 in the nationally-representative Population Assessment for Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. Engagement with online tobacco marketing within the past year was assessed through eight forms of engagement. A weighted logistic regression model was fit with engagement as outcome and socio-demographic and psychosocial characteristics, internet-related and substance use behavior, tobacco-related risk factors, tobacco use status, and prior engagement with online tobacco marketing as covariates. RESULTS: Accounting for other covariates including tobacco use status and prior engagement with online tobacco marketing, the odds of past-year engagement were higher for sexual minority males (aOR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.05-2.35) compared to straight males and higher for sexual minority females (aOR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.13-1.87) compared to straight females. The odds of past-year engagement were also higher for Hispanics (aOR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.11-1.56) and non-Hispanic Blacks (aOR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.14-1.77) compared to non-Hispanic Whites.

METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of tobacco 827 ads run in the US in 2016. Ads were double coded by trained coders across ten domains: promotions, web/social media presence, use cues, warnings and disclaimers, descriptors, claims, activities, setting, imagery, and themes. RESULTS: Cigarette ads relied on promotional tactics like discounts and sweepstakes and featured links to websites and mobile apps, all of which can increase brand loyalty and customer engagement. E-cigarette ads used tactics that appear to target new consumers, such as highlighting the product's qualities and modeling product use. Little cigar/cigarillo ads often positioned the product as social and featured music, urban and nightlife settings. Smokeless tobacco ads frequently featured themes, activities and settings stereotypically thought of as masculine. CONCLUSIONS: The tactics used to advertise tobacco products can help generate new consumers, encourage product/brand switching, and escalate use among current users. Understanding how different products are advertised can inform the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory efforts, and tobacco counter-marketing campaigns.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study aimed to assess whether dual e-cigarette users have lower smoking cessation rates than (i) exclusive cigarette smokers or (ii) dual users of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and cigarettes. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 1,498 smokers in England. The independent variable was dual use of e-cigarettes (n = 292), dual use of NRT (n = 117), or exclusive smoking (n = 1089), assessed at baseline. Outcomes were overall quit rate, past-year quit attempts, and success of quit attempts at 12-month follow-up. Baseline sociodemographic and smoking-related covariates were included. RESULTS: Overall quit rates were not lower in dual e-cigarette users than exclusive smokers (OR = 1.31, 0.90-1.89). Dual users of e-cigarettes were more likely than exclusive smokers to make a quit attempt, but this difference was not significant after adjustment for covariates (OR = 1.27, 95%CI 0.95-1.69). Among those attempting to quit, success rates did not differ significantly. Dual users of e-cigarettes were less likely to make a quit attempt than dual users of NRT (OR = 0.61, 95%CI 0.38-0.98) but the success rate of quit attempts and overall quit rates did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: In England, dual use of e-cigarettes is not associated with reduced overall quit rates compared with exclusive smoking or dual use of NRT. However, dual use of e-cigarettes is associated with a slightly higher quit attempt rate than exclusive smoking but lower than dual use of NRT.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Coincident with expanded legalization, young adults' use of cannabis (marijuana) has also steadily increased in recent years. Use of tobacco products can increase the chances of later cannabis initiation among youth. However, most longitudinal investigations of tobacco and cannabis use patterns have focused on tobacco cigarettes, included adolescents as opposed to young adults, and have only employed two timepoints. The current study examined prospective associations between e-cigarette and cannabis use in a large, diverse college sample assessed over four timepoints (freshman - senior year; N = 4,670). E-cigarette use and cannabis use were modelled in a four-wave cross-lagged model. The results showed significant bidirectional associations between both substances, even after controlling for time-varying levels of depressive symptoms, alcohol use, and polysubstance use, sensation seeking, demographic variables, concurrent associations and previous levels of use. Moreover, the significance of the predictive path from e-cigarette use to later cannabis use remained unchanged when we ran the same model, but restricted the sample to e-cigarette-only users (i.e., never cigarette smokers), whereas only one prospective path from cannabis to e-cigarette use was significant in this subsample. The current findings suggest that the association of e-cigarette use and cannabis use is likely bidirectional, with stronger support for the link from e-cigarette use to later cannabis use, above and beyond cigarette use. As e-cigarettes gain further hold of the tobacco product market share and cannabis legalization continues to expand, data such as these will be critical for informing regulatory decisions for e-cigarettes and cannabis, particularly involving their accessibility to youth and young adults.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Data are from the adult sample (18+) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a nationally representative longitudinal cohort survey conducted September 2013-December 2014 (Wave 1 (W1) n = 32,320) and October 2014-October 2015 (Wave 2 (W2) n = 28,362). RESULTS: Wave 1 users and non-users of e-cigarettes, filtered cigars, cigarillos, and pipes, who perceived these products as less harmful had greater odds of using the product at W2. For the other products, there was an interaction between W1 perceived harm and W1 use status in predicting W2 product use. At W2, a smaller percentage of U.S. adults rated e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes compared to W1 (41.2% W1, 29.0% W2). Believing non-cigarette products to be less harmful than cigarettes was more strongly associated with subsequent product use in the oldest age group (55+ years) while weaker effects were observed in the youngest age group (18-24 years). This moderating effect of age was significant for e-cigarettes, hookah, traditional cigars, and cigarillos. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to prevent initiation and promote cessation of these products may benefit from understanding and addressing perceptions of these products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

We aimed to assess associations between SES indicators and three distinct aspects of the smoking cessation process: attempting to quit; use of evidence-based cessation treatments; and success. METHODS: We analysed data of 12,161 last-year smokers (i.e., current smokers and recent ex-smokers who quit ≤ 12 months) from 20 waves (June/July 2016 to August/September 2019) of the German Study on Tobacco Use (DEBRA) - a representative household survey. Associations between indicators of SES (income and education) and (1) last-year quit attempts; (2) use of evidence-based cessation treatment or electronic cigarettes during the last attempt; and (3) short-term self-reported abstinence were analysed using multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Of all last-years smokers, 18.6% had attempted to quit, of whom 15.2% had successfully stopped. Higher income (OR 0.82, 95%CI = 0.77-0.88 per 1000€) but low vs. high education (OR 0.83, 95%CI = 0.73-0.95) were associated with lower odds of quit attempts. In smokers with quit attempts, higher income but not education was associated with higher odds of using cessation medication (OR 1.31, 95%CI = 1.08-1.59 per 1000 €). Neither income nor education were associated with using behavioural support or success. CONCLUSIONS: In the German healthcare system without free access to evidence-based cessation therapy, low-income smokers are more likely to make a quit attempt but less likely to use cessation medication than high-income smokers. Equitable access to such medication is crucial to reduce SES-related health disparities.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

A qualitative study of youth's and parents' reactions to e-cigarette prevention advertisements.","INTRODUCTION: Growing rates of e-cigarette use among youth have reached epidemic proportions. Media messages have been deployed to counteract this trend, but their evaluations are lacking. We assessed youth's and parents' reactions to various existing e-cigarette prevention messages. METHODS: In 2019, 12 focus groups were conducted with youth (n = 63) and parents (n = 27). Participants discussed their reactions to 9 existing messages with various topics. RESULTS: Information on chemicals in e-cigarettes was seen as new and scary, but unknown chemical names created confusion. Youth appreciated novel ways to visualize health effects of e-cigarettes (parasites in the body) and nicotine's effect on behavior (mood swings), but they cautioned that some of these effects (irritability) are not always caused by nicotine. Some participants did not know if e-cigarette companies were ""Big Tobacco."" Some found it hard to argue with the financial costs of vaping, but others did not think they were too great. Participants recommended messages featuring testimonials from diverse adolescents and messages aimed at youth who are struggling with addiction to e-cigarettes. CONCLUSION: Messages would be particularly effective if they featured real youth and did not look like adults created them for youth. Another area that is currently not covered in media messages is talking to youth who are using e-cigarettes and might be already addicted but do not know where to turn for help. These adolescents need to be referred to resources for cessation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Potential disclosure strategies need to be tested to confirm whether users recognize such posts as commercially sponsored. METHODS: Between July - August 2019, young adult (ages 16-24; n = 200) participants were recruited to view their native Instagram feed on a laboratory mobile device. Posts from e-cigarette influencers were manipulated to add either #ad or #sponsored while eye tracking software measured visual attention. Participants self-reported their interpretation of the hashtags in open-ended responses. Logistic regression analyses compared recognition of commercial content by condition, and qualitative content analyses summarized the key themes related to the hashtags. RESULTS: The #ad condition had nearly twice the odds of commercial recognition compared to #sponsored (OR = 1.98, CI: 1.14-3.38). Every second of attention paid to the hashtag significantly increased the odds of commercial recognition by 22% (OR: 1.22, CI: 1.00-1.33). CONCLUSION: The #ad disclosure attracted visual attention and significantly increased recognition of commercial sponsorship from young social media users. Labeling commercially sponsored content on social media is a promising strategy to better inform users about paid social media influence.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, little is known how these restrictions may impact adult vapers. This study describes the level of support and predictive behavioral responses to a hypothetical NVP ban on non-tobacco flavors among regular adult vapers who only use flavors that would be banned. METHODS: Data came from 851 regular vapers (all current or ex-smokers) participating in the 2020 ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey in Canada, England, and the United States (US). A random sample of respondents in each country received and completed the questions about flavor bans: (1) do you support or oppose a ban on all non-tobacco flavors; and (2) what would you do if all flavors were banned, with the exception of tobacco in the US, and tobacco and menthol in Canada and England. Those who used tobacco-flavored or unflavored NVPs were excluded from all analyses, and additionally, vapers of menthol flavor in Canada and England were excluded from Aim 2. RESULTS: Overall, 53.6% of vapers were strongly opposed to flavor bans, 28.2% were opposed, 9.3% were in support, 3.6% were in strong support, and 5.2% did not know. Predicted behavioral responses were: 28.8% would continue vaping an available flavor, 28.3% would find a way to get their banned flavor(s), 17.1% would stop vaping and smoke instead, 12.9% said that they would stop vaping and not smoke, and 12.9% do not know what they would do. Responses to a potential flavor ban largely varied by smoking and vaping status, and by the level of support of a flavor restriction policy. CONCLUSIONS: At this time, it is not clear what net population-level consequences would occur if non-tobacco flavored NVPs were prohibited. While a majority of vapers in this study opposed this policy, and many vapers would not be willing to switch to available flavors, there was considerable variability in predicted behavioral responses.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We assessed smokers' and non-smokers' cognitive, affective, and sensory responses to Camel Snus (CS) and Nicotine gum (NG) to gauge future intentions to use. METHOD: In a single laboratory session, 348 participants (including current smokers and nonsmokers in Buffalo, NY and Boston, MA) were exposed to CS and NG products in counterbalanced order. Exposure involved a cumulative set of 3 steps in which participants i) viewed an advertisement; ii) viewed the packaging, and iii) touched and smelled the product, without actual use. Current daily and non-daily smokers were invited to undertake a fourth exposure step by sampling the product. Following product exposure, participants completed perception measures and reported future intentions to use either product at the end of the survey. After each exposure, participants' reported feelings of valence and arousal. RESULTS: Smokers reported greater preference to try NG (63.8%) compared with CS (17.4%) or neither (18.8%), whereas majority of nonsmokers preferred neither product (64.3%) (p < 0.01). Of those offered to sample the products, 78.3% daily smokers and 68.4% non-daily smokers opted to sample. When asked about intentions to try, a greater proportion of smokers stated a preference to try NG over CS, as did the small number of nonsmokers who expressed a preference. CONCLUSION: Intentions to try CS were low despite different levels of exposure to product, and this low product appeal and interest in use may translate to limited potential of CS to serve as a reduced harm product for smokers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Thus, this study describes differences on sociodemographic, cigarette-dependence, health and behavioral variables, and risk perceptions associated with smoking cannabis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 6941 respondents from the 2020 ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey (US, Canada, Australia, England). Adult daily cigarette smokers were included and categorized as: cigarette-only smokers (never used cannabis/previously used cannabis, but not in the past 12 months, n = 4857); occasional co-consumers (cannabis use in the past 12 months, but < weekly use, n = 739); or regular co-consumers (use cannabis ≥ weekly, n = 1345). All outcomes were self-reported. Regression models were conducted on weighted data. RESULTS: Overall, 19.9 % of respondents reported regular cannabis co-use and 10.1 % reported occasional co-use. Regular co-use was highest in Canada (27.2 %), followed by the US (24.4 %), England (12.7 %) and Australia (12.3 %). Compared to cigarette-only smokers, regular co-consumers were more likely to be male and report chest/breathing problems (p < 0.001). All co-consumers were more likely to be younger, have lower income, be experiencing financial stress, reside in Canada, have depressive symptoms, use alcohol more frequently and binge drink, use other tobacco/nicotine products, and perceive smoking cannabis as low health risk and less harmful than smoking cigarettes (all p < 0.001). Cigarette dependence measures were similar between co-consumers and cigarette-only smokers (all p ≥ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although there were no differences on cigarette dependence measures between daily cigarette smokers who do and do not use cannabis, there are several other risk factors that may affect tobacco use and abstinence among co-consumers (e.g., greater depression, high-risk alcohol consumption). Thus, tobacco cessation treatment may require multi-pronged strategies to address other health behaviors. Continued surveillance is needed to determine the nature and health implications of co-use considering changing policies, markets, and products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

METHODS: 1,045 adult (≥18y) smokers in England provided data at baseline (April 2015-November 2020) and reported a serious past-year quit attempt at 12-month follow-up. Our outcome was smoking cessation, defined as self-reported abstinence at 12 months. Independent variables were use in the most recent quit attempt of: varenicline, prescription NRT, over-the-counter NRT, e-cigarettes, and traditional behavioural support. Potential confounders were age, sex, social grade, alcohol consumption, and level of dependence (measured at baseline), variables relating to the most recent quit attempt (measured at 12-month follow-up), and survey year. RESULTS: Participants who reported using varenicline in their most recent quit attempt had significantly higher odds of abstinence than those who did not, after adjustment for potential confounders and use of other aids (OR = 2.69, 95 %CI = 1.43-5.05). Data were inconclusive regarding whether using prescription NRT, over-the-counter NRT, e-cigarettes, or traditional behavioural support was associated with increased odds of abstinence (p > 0.05; Bayes factors = 0.41-1.71, expected effect size OR = 1.19), but provided moderate evidence that using e-cigarettes was more likely associated with no effect than reduced odds (Bayes factor = 0.31, expected effect size OR = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Use of varenicline in a quit attempt was associated with increased odds of successful smoking cessation. Data were inconclusive regarding a benefit of e-cigarettes for cessation but showed use of e-cigarettes was unlikely to be associated with reduced odds of cessation.

METHODS: Young adults (n = 175) were instructed to record all sightings of marketing (both in-person and online) related to tobacco for 28 days. Tobacco product use and recall of message encounters were assessed daily using app-initiated EMA. RESULTS: Participants who reported exposure to tobacco messages were significantly more likely to report using tobacco, adjusting for gender, age, race/ethnicity, baseline use of any tobacco product, and having friends who use tobacco and e-cigarettes (p <.001). For each industry-sponsored message viewed, the odds of using tobacco or e-cigarettes in a given day increased by a factor of 1.77 (95 % CI = 1.41, 2.23). For each user-generated message viewed, the odds of using tobacco or e-cigarettes in a given day increased by a factor of 1.52 (95 % CI = 1.27, 1.83). DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically examine the association between exposure to user-generated messages and daily tobacco use. The findings suggests that there is a unique element to user-generated messages that distinguishes them from both traditional marketing and from simple peer influence.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study describes the average amount of time using e-cigarettes before dependence milestones emerge and the differences in developing dependence between e-cigarette users who smoke cigarettes compared to those who do not. METHODS: Adolescents and young adults aged 16-25 living in Canada were recruited into an online survey in 2021. Current (past-month) e-cigarette users completed 15 items assessing dependence from the Penn-State Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index and the E-cigarette Dependence Scale for a total of 12 behavioural (e.g., difficulty refraining from vaping) and 3 frequency (e.g., using e-cigarette daily, weekly, or monthly) indicators of dependence milestones. Number of years after e-cigarette onset at which the cumulative probability of attaining each milestone was 25 % was computed. RESULTS: Among 1205 participants, most (80.6 %) were female, 73.7 % were Caucasian, and 49.7 % resided in Ontario. Ten of the 12 e-cigarette use milestones were attained by 25 % of respondents 2 years after starting vaping except for daily cigarette use (2.5 years after onset) and waking at night to vape (5.6 years after onset). Within the entire study population, frequency milestones (weekly, monthly, daily e-cigarette use) were attained faster by ever-smokers (hazard ratio compared to attainment by never-smokers: 1.12, 1.21, and 1.28 respectively), whereas for at least monthly users, behavioural milestones were attained faster by never-smokers. DISCUSSION: Many current e-cigarette users developed symptoms of e-cigarette dependence between two and five years since onset. Never smokers may be at higher risk of becoming e-cigarette dependent since they attained e-cigarette dependence milestones faster than smokers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

Adding features to pro-vaping Instagram influencer posts, such as a nicotine warning label and vaping cessation resources, could help counteract posts' negative influence. METHODS: Young adults (N = 2,179; Mage = 22.6 [SD = 0.4]; 53.0 % cisgender women, 45.1 % Hispanic) completed an online experiment in 2021-2022 through an ongoing prospective cohort study. Participants viewed three simulated pro-vaping Instagram influencer posts in a four-group, between-subjects design. Post features differed by experimental condition: ""label-only"" (nicotine warning label on post), ""link-only"" (link to vaping cessation resources under post), ""L&L"" (label and link), or ""control"" (neither). Participants rated each influencer's traits (honest, trustworthy, informed, smart, attractive, popular; 0-100 %). After viewing all three posts, participants reported use intentions, susceptibility, positive and negative expectancies, and harm perceptions around the fictitious advertised vaping product. Past-month vapers additionally reported their desire and self-efficacy for quitting. RESULTS: L&L (versus control and link-only) participants viewed influencers as more honest, trustworthy, and informed. L&L (versus control) participants had lower odds of susceptibility to using the advertised product, lower positive expectancies, and greater negative expectancies. The label and link did not significantly affect participants' intentions to use the product, perceived harm of the product, or desire or self-efficacy for quitting vaping. CONCLUSIONS: Providing a nicotine warning label and link to vaping cessation resources on influencers' Instagram posts may have the unintended effect of increasing positive perceptions of the influencer. However, they may reduce susceptibility to product use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

To assess if messaging can correct these misperceptions, we tested factsheets that manipulated presences vs absence of (1) a causal alternative (i.e., combustion, not nicotine, causes disease) and/or (2) a reason for the misinformation (i.e., nicotine is the focus of many health messages). METHODS: We used an online 2 × 2 factorial experiment of n = 193 adults who smoke and believe nicotine causes cancer to assess the effect of different message strategies on perceptions of tobacco products and switch intention. Pre-post differences and between-condition differences were assessed. RESULTS: Strength of agreement with the statement that nicotine is a major cause of cancer decreased and switch intentions increased after message exposure. The proportion of participants with low relative harm perceptions increased for e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (p <.0001) and decreased for very low nicotine cigarettes compared to cigarettes. The message with both strategies decreased agreement that nicotine causes cancer more than the message with only the causal alternative. There was no significant effect of condition on relative harm beliefs or switch intentions. CONCLUSIONS: Messages with both corrective strategies can reduce the belief that nicotine causes cancer to a greater extent than messaging that only contains a causal alternative. Belief accuracy increased after any message exposure, but these findings should be interpreted cautiously given the study design. Combined strategies should be further investigated in larger samples.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

METHODS: Associations between measures of social media engagement (daily social media use and liking/following tobacco brands) and tobacco initiation risk were examined using data from Waves 2 and 3 (2014-2015) of the US Population Assessment for Tobacco and Health study. Separate log-binomial models, accounting for missing data via multiple imputation and using propensity score adjustment to address confounding, estimated the adjusted relative risk (aRR) of any tobacco initiation and poly-use (2 + products) initiation at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Among the 8,672 youth with no prior tobacco use (49.3% female, mean [SD] age 14.1 [1.7]), 63.5% used social media at least daily, and 3.3% reported liking/following ≥ 1 tobacco brands on social media. Those reporting daily or more frequent social media use (compared to less) were at increased risk for tobacco (aRR 1.67; 95% CI 1.38-2.02) and polytobacco initiation (aRR 1.32; 95% CI 0.98-1.78). Although results were imprecise, liking/following ≥ 1 tobacco brands on social media (versus none) was associated with tobacco (aRR 1.34; 95% CI 0.95-1.89) or polytobacco initiation (aRR 1.60; 95% CI 0.99-2.60). In sensitivity analyses, liking/following cigarette or cigarillo brands was associated with polytobacco initiation. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to a growing evidence-base describing the exposure of youth to tobacco-related social media content.

Earlier HID initiation is associated with high-risk alcohol use in young adulthood. Less is known about when HID initiation occurs relative to other substances and how it is associated with subsequent substance use. This study examined survey data from 468 respondents (35.5% female, 65.5% non-Hispanic white) who reported initiating HID by age 20. Weighted descriptive statistics of year of initiation for HID, marijuana, and nicotine were obtained. Weighted linear and logistic regressions examined associations between year and order of HID initiation and age 20 substance use (i.e., nicotine vaping, cigarette use, other tobacco use, marijuana use, marijuana vaping, simultaneous alcohol and marijuana use, and other illicit drug use) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms. Over half of participants initiated HID after marijuana (54.6%) and nicotine (54.4%). Later HID initiation was associated with fewer AUD symptoms and lower odds of all outcomes except marijuana and other illicit drug use. Initiating HID before marijuana was associated with lower odds of marijuana use outcomes and other illicit drug use at age 20. Initiating HID before nicotine was associated with lower odds of all substance use outcomes at age 20. Earlier HID initiation was associated with risk for subsequent substance use, but initiating HID earlier than other substances was not. Given its association with both alcohol-related outcomes and other substance use in young adulthood, earlier HID initiation is an important target for screening and intervention.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The purpose of this secondary analysis was to assess the impact of e-cigarette flavoring choice on e-cigarette uptake and changes in cigarette smoking in a large nationwide trial of e-cigarette provision in the United States. METHODS: A free four-week supply of e-cigarettes was provided with minimal instructions to use to adults who smoke (N = 427). Participants selected from five flavor options: tobacco, menthol, blue/blackberry (one flavor), apple melon, or iced fruit. Participants could choose up to two flavors for each of two, two-week provisions of e-cigarettes. RESULTS: Participants who received an e-cigarette were 52 % female, 32 % non-white, and smoked an average (SD) of 14.8 (7.2) cigarettes per day at baseline. Only 5 % (n = 22) of participants chose to exclusively receive tobacco flavor. Compared to participants who exclusively received the tobacco flavor, participants who received any other flavor combination had greater e-cigarette uptake at the end of product provision (74 % vs. 55 %), were more likely to reduce cigarette smoking by at least 50 % at the end of product provision (34 % vs. 14 %) and at the final 6-month follow up (29 % vs. 5 %), and numerically, but not statistically, more likely to be abstinent from cigarettes at the end of product provision (11 % vs. 5 %) and the final 6-month follow-up (14 % vs. 5 %). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that non-tobacco e-cigarette flavors may be more appealing than tobacco flavors, and better promote uptake of e-cigarettes and cigarette smoking reduction. Large-scale randomized trials in which participants are assigned to either tobacco or non-tobacco flavors are critical.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Despite the emerging link between pouch risk perceptions and use, few studies have examined product perceptions. Accordingly, this study explored perceptions and attitudes towards nicotine pouches among Australian adolescents, young adults, and adults. We also sought to identify correlates of risk perceptions and attitudes. METHODS: An online survey was administered to 1,598 Australians aged 16-39 years, of whom 1,230 reported being aware of nicotine pouches and were the focus of this study. The survey assessed absolute and relative risk perceptions; attitudes towards nicotine pouch use; use of nicotine and tobacco products; exposure to pouch advertising; and use of pouches among family and friends. Regression analyses assessed correlates of risk perceptions and attitudes towards pouch use. RESULTS: Respondents generally perceived nicotine pouches to be less harmful and addictive or equivalent in harm and addictiveness compared to tobacco cigarettes, smokeless tobacco products, and e-cigarettes. A substantial minority (38-40%) believed pouches to be equivalent to nicotine replacement therapy in terms of harm and addictiveness. Positive perceptions were more likely among men, adults, those who currently use pouches, and those who had a greater number of family members and close friends who use pouches. CONCLUSIONS: Favourable perceptions of nicotine pouches appear to be forming in the community. Efforts are needed to ensure the public is informed of the considerable unknowns in relation to this novel product. Ensuring regulatory frameworks are agile enough to capture new products being developed by the tobacco industry may assist with minimising product uptake.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

An understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which chronic alcohol consumption promotes carcinogenesis is important for development of appropriate strategies for prevention and treatment of alcohol-associated cancers. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, Office of Dietary Supplements, Office of Rare Diseases, National Cancer Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, sponsored an international symposium on Mechanisms of Alcohol-Associated Cancers in Bethesda, Maryland, USA, October 2004. The following is a summary of the symposium. Chronic ethanol consumption may promote carcinogenesis by (1) production of acetaldehyde, which is a weak mutagen and carcinogen; (2) induction of cytochrome P450 2E1 and associated oxidative stress and conversion of procarcinogens to carcinogens; (3) depletion of S-adenosylmethionine and, consequently, induction of global DNA hypomethylation; (4) induction of increased production of inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins and components of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling; (5) accumulation of iron and associated oxidative stress; (6) inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 and increased estrogen responsiveness (primarily in breast); and (7) impairment of retinoic acid metabolism.

In order for the product to appeal to smokers, tobacco companies have been manufacturing new noncombusted oral tobacco (i.e., moist snuff) that is lower in moisture content and nitrosamine levels, packaged in small sachets and ""spitless."" While the primary motives of the major tobacco companies are to maintain or increase tobacco use, some members of the public health community perceive the use of noncombusted oral tobacco products as a harm reduction tool. Because cigarette smoking is associated with greater toxicant exposure compared to noncombusted oral tobacco, reduced mortality and morbidity are hypothesized to ensue, if cigarette smokers switched completely to these products. However, variability exists in levels of nicotine and toxicants and potential health consequences from use within and across countries. Therefore, promulgating noncombusted oral tobacco products as a safer alternative to smoking or as a substitute for smoking may engender more rather than less harm. To date, limited research is available on the effects of marketing noncombusted oral tobacco products to smokers, to support the use of these products as a harm reduction tool, and to determine the effects of varying levels of tobacco toxicants including nicotine on health. The need exists for manufacturing standards to lower toxicant levels of all noncombusted oral tobacco products, for the formulation of appropriate tobacco-product regulations and for the development of a strategic plan by the public health community to address this controversial topic.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Despite consensus that smokeless tobacco products as sold in the United States are less dangerous than cigarettes, there is no consensus on how to proceed. Diverse factions have different policy concerns. While the tobacco industry is exempted from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight, the pharmaceutical industry whose nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) medicines compete with smokeless tobacco as noncombustible nicotine-delivery systems are regulated by the FDA. Some public health experts support smokeless tobacco use to reduce population harm from tobacco; other public health experts oppose promoting smokeless tobacco for harm reduction. Adult consumers can freely purchase currently-marketed smokeless tobacco products and even more-deadly cigarettes. Concerns with and advantages of smokeless tobacco products are discussed. In that noncombustible medicinal nicotine-delivery systems have been proven to be effective smoking-cessation aids, smokeless tobacco, as another source of psychoactive doses of nicotine, could be used similarly, in a dose-response fashion as a smoking-cessation aid (consistent with FDA principles for evaluating generic versions of drugs). Price measures should be used on tobacco products to make costs to consumers proportional to product health risks (which would make smokeless tobacco much cheaper than cigarettes), and smokeless tobacco should be encouraged as an option for smoking cessation in adult smokers, particularly for those who have failed to stop smoking using NRT or other methods.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

A consortium of eight governmental and nonprofit organizations sponsored the update. EVIDENCE: Approximately 8700 English-language, peer-reviewed articles and abstracts, published between 1975 and 2007, were reviewed for data that addressed assessment and treatment of tobacco dependence. This literature served as the basis for more than 35 meta-analyses. CONSENSUS PROCESS: Two panel meetings and numerous conference calls and staff meetings were held to evaluate meta-analyses and relevant literature, to synthesize the results, and to develop recommendations. The updated guideline was then externally reviewed by more than 90 experts, made available for public comment, and revised.

The extent to which these workers have coverage for tobacco-dependence treatments (TDTs) through their employer-sponsored health care is unknown. METHODS: This research used the 2000 and 2005 data from the California Employer Health Benefits Surveys to determine coverage for TDTs by private firms. The overall response rates of firms to the survey were 41% and 36%, respectively. The samples used in this analysis are limited to private firms in California that offered employee health benefits in 2000 (n=729) or in 2005 (n=745). RESULTS: This research found that among private firms offering health insurance coverage, there was a significant increase from 2000 to 2005 in the percentage of workers covered for any TDTs (44% to 57%). Rates of coverage for all three forms of TDTs (nicotine replacement therapy, Zyban, counseling) doubled from 11% to 22% over the 5-year time period. CONCLUSIONS: Although coverage levels have improved, they still fall short of the recommendations made in the U.S. Public Health Service guidelines as well as in the Healthy People 2010 objectives. Given the effectiveness, cost effectiveness, public demand for coverage, and relatively low cost of covering TDTs--estimated to be $3-$6 per member per year--it is difficult to understand why such coverage is not more widely available in California.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Tobacco companies conducted extensive research on social smokers long before health authorities did and marketed products to promote this smoking behavior. PURPOSE: Research is described and mechanisms identified that are used to promote social smoking to help improve cessation strategies in this growing group. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Searches from 2006 to 2008 of previously secret tobacco industry documents using keywords social smoker, light smoker, casual smoker, youth smoker, and occasional smoker, followed by snowball searching. Data analysis was conducted in 2008. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Tobacco industry research identified characteristics of social smokers that include: (1) denial of personal nicotine addiction; (2) self-categorization as a nonsmoker; (3) propensity for decreased tobacco use in response to smoke-free laws; (4) variations in age, education, ethnicity, and socioeconomic backgrounds; and (5) a perceived immunity to personal health effects of tobacco but fear of consequences to others. Tobacco companies developed marketing strategies aimed at social smokers, including ""non-habit forming"" cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: Previously considered a transient behavior, social smoking is also a stable consumption pattern. Focused clinical questions to detect social smoking are needed and may include, ""Have you smoked any cigarettes or used any tobacco products in the past month?"" as opposed to ""Are you a smoker?"" Clinicians should recognize that social smokers might be motivated to quit after education on the dangers of secondhand smoke rather than on personal health risks or with pharmacotherapy.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, experience from countries that have removed these descriptors suggests that different terms, colors, or numbers communicating the same messages may replace them. PURPOSE: The main purpose of this study was to examine how cigarette pack colors are perceived by smokers to correspond to different descriptive terms. METHODS: Newspaper advertisements and CraigsList.org postings directed interested current smokers to a survey website. Eligible participants were shown an array of six cigarette packages (altered to remove all descriptive terms) and asked to link package images with their corresponding descriptive terms. Participants were then asked to identify which pack in the array they would choose if they were concerned with health, tar, nicotine, image, and taste. RESULTS: A total of 193 participants completed the survey from February to March 2008 (data were analyzed from May 2008 through November 2010). Participants were more accurate in matching descriptors to pack images for Marlboro brand cigarettes than for unfamiliar Peter Jackson brand (sold in Australia). Smokers overwhelmingly chose the ""whitest"" pack if they were concerned about health, tar, and nicotine. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers in the U.S. associate brand descriptors with colors. Further, white packaging appears to most influence perceptions of safety. Removal of descriptor terms but not the associated colors will be insufficient in eliminating misperceptions about the risks from smoking communicated to smokers through packaging.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess current popularity of several noncigarette tobacco products in the U.S. METHODS: In 2009, a total of 10,587 adults completed a consumer mail-in survey (ConsumerStyles). Based on survey results, the weighted percentages of adults who heard and tried snus, dissolvable tobacco products, flavored little cigars, and flavored cigarettes were computed in 2010. A subset of this sample (n=4556) completed the HealthStyles survey, which included items about health perceptions of these products and use in the past 30 days. RESULTS: The percentage of U.S. adults in the sample who were aware of these products ranged from 10.4% (dissolvable tobacco) to 44.6% (flavored little cigars). One third of adults who had heard of flavored little cigars tried them and 10.1% had used them in the past 30 days; among those who had heard of them, 27.4% tried flavored cigarettes and 12.6% tried snus. In general, young adults, men, and smokers were most likely to have heard of each product. At least one third of adults were uncertain if these products were as harmful as cigarettes (range=37.3% [snus] to 50.3% [dissolvable tobacco]). CONCLUSIONS: The awareness of these tobacco products in this sample varied.

EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Research during the years 2010-2011 revealed that the federal regulation of other tobacco products lags behind the regulation of more ""traditional"" tobacco products, such as cigarettes and moist snuff. Federal regulatory options to expand regulation of these products were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The article highlights several federal policy interventions that would address gaps in the regulation of other tobacco products. The FDA must determine whether these interventions will benefit public health and, if so, to what extent--the legal criteria for intervention under the federal Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

PURPOSE: To estimate expenditures for e-cigarette advertising in magazines, TV, the Internet, newspapers, and radio in the U.S. from 2011 to 2012. METHODS: E-cigarette advertising data were obtained from leading media intelligence companies, Kantar Media and Nielsen. Estimated e-cigarette advertising expenditures were summarized across media channels for 2011 and 2012. Additional information on brands advertised and market-level buys (i.e., local versus national) also was examined. RESULTS: Overall, e-cigarette advertising expenditures across media channels tripled from $6.4 million in 2011 to $18.3 million in 2012. Expenditures were highest in magazines and TV and lowest in newspapers and on the Internet. More than 80 unique brands were advertised, but blu eCigs dominated ad spending, comprising 76.7% of all e-cigarette advertising expenditures in 2012. National markets were increasingly targeted from 54.9% of ad buys in 2011 to 87.0% of ad buys in 2012. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette advertising expenditures are increasing, with a greater focus on national markets and TV ads, which will likely increase consumer awareness and use of e-cigarettes in the future. Federal-level efforts are needed to mandate that e-cigarette companies report their advertising expenditures. Future studies should examine how e-cigarette advertising expenditures and message content influence consumer awareness of, interest in, and use of e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

As patterns of product adoption are frequently driven and reinforced by marketing, it is important to understand the marketing claims encountered by consumers. PURPOSE: To describe the main advertising claims made on branded e-cigarette retail websites. METHODS: Websites were retrieved from two major search engines in 2011 using iterative searches with the following terms: electronic cigarette, e-cigarette, e-cig, and personal vaporizer. Fifty-nine websites met inclusion criteria, and 13 marketing claims were coded for main marketing messages in 2012. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of the websites made explicit or implicit health-related claims, 64% had a smoking cessation-related claim, 22% featured doctors, and 76% claimed that the product does not produce secondhand smoke. Comparisons to cigarettes included claims that e-cigarettes were cleaner (95%) and cheaper (93%). Eighty-eight percent stated that the product could be smoked anywhere and 71% mentioned using the product to circumvent clean air policies. Candy, fruit, and coffee flavors were offered on most sites. Youthful appeals included images or claims of modernity (73%); increased social status (44%); enhanced social activity (32%); romance (31%); and use by celebrities (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Health claims and smoking-cessation messages that are unsupported by current scientific evidence are frequently used to sell e-cigarettes. Implied and overt health claims, the presence of doctors on websites, celebrity endorsements, and the use of characterizing flavors should be prohibited.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The tobacco industry has targeted youth, women, and racial minorities with menthol cigarettes, and these groups smoke menthol cigarettes at higher rates. The tobacco industry has also targeted the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities with tobacco product marketing. PURPOSE: To assess current menthol cigarette smoking by sexual orientation among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2009-2010 National Adult Tobacco Survey, a national landline and cellular telephone survey of non-institutionalized U.S. adults aged ≥18 years, to compare current menthol cigarette smoking between LGBT (n=2,431) and heterosexual/straight (n=110,841) adults. Data were analyzed during January-April 2014 using descriptive statistics and logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, race, and educational attainment. RESULTS: Among all current cigarette smokers, 29.6% reported usually smoking menthol cigarettes in the past 30 days. Menthol use was significantly higher among LGBT smokers, with 36.3% reporting that the cigarettes they usually smoked were menthol compared to 29.3% of heterosexual/straight smokers (p<0.05); this difference was particularly prominent among LGBT females (42.9%) compared to heterosexual/straight women (32.4%) (p<0.05). Following adjustment, LGBT smokers had greater odds of usually smoking menthol cigarettes than heterosexual/straight smokers (OR=1.31, 95% CI=1.09, 1.57).

PURPOSE: To understand how FDA tobacco regulation beliefs are associated with judgments about tobacco product-related risks. METHODS: The Health Information National Trends Survey is a national survey of the U.S. adult population. Data used in this analysis were collected from October 2012 through January 2013 (N=3,630) by mailed questionnaire and analyzed in 2013. Weighted bivariate chi-square analyses were used to assess associations among FDA regulation belief, tobacco harm judgments, sociodemographics, and smoking status. A weighted multinomial logistic regression was conducted where FDA regulation belief was regressed on tobacco product judgments, controlling for sociodemographic variables and smoking status. RESULTS: About 41% believed that the FDA regulates tobacco products in the U.S., 23.6% reported the FDA does not, and 35.3% did not know. Chi-square analyses showed that smoking status was significantly related to harm judgments about electronic cigarettes (p<0.0001). The multinomial logistic regression revealed that uncertainty about FDA regulation was associated with tobacco product harm judgment uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco product harm perceptions are associated with beliefs about tobacco product regulation by the FDA. These findings suggest the need for increased public awareness and understanding of the role of tobacco product regulation in protecting public health.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Our objective is to assess state-specific annual sales and average prices for e-cigarettes in the U.S. METHODS: Commercial retail scanner data were used to assess total dollar sales and average price per unit for disposable e-cigarettes, starter kits, and cartridge refills for selected states and the total U.S. during 2012-2013. Data were analyzed in 2014. Data were available for convenience stores (29 states) and food, drug, and mass merchandisers (44 states). RESULTS: In convenience stores, dollar sales increased markedly during 2012-2013: 320.8% for disposable e-cigarettes, 72.4% for starter kits, and 82% for cartridges. In food, drug, and mass merchandisers, dollar sales increased 49.5% for disposable e-cigarettes, 89.4% for starter kits, and 126.2% for cartridges. Average prices across all product categories increased in convenience stores and decreased in food, drug, and mass merchandisers. Sales and prices varied substantially across states included in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Sales of all e-cigarette device types grew considerably in convenience stores and food, drug, and mass merchandisers during 2012-2013. The market for e-cigarettes is growing rapidly, resulting in dynamic sales and price changes that vary across the U.S. Continued state-specific surveillance of the e-cigarette market is warranted.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study sought to characterize openness to using non-cigarette tobacco products and associated factors among U.S. young adults. METHODS: In 2014, National Adult Tobacco Survey data (2012-2013) were analyzed to characterize openness to using the following tobacco products among all young adults aged 18-29 years (N=5,985): cigars; electronic cigarettes (""e-cigarettes""); hookah; pipe tobacco; chew, snuff, or dip; snus; and dissolvables. Among those who were not current users of each product, multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between demographics, cigarette smoking status, lifetime use of other non-cigarette products, perceived harm and addictiveness of smoking, and receipt of tobacco industry promotions and openness to using each product. RESULTS: Among all young adults, openness to using non-cigarette tobacco products was greatest for hookah (28.2%); e-cigarettes (25.5%); and cigars (19.1%). In multivariable analyses, which included non-current users of each product, non-current ever, current, and former smokers were more likely than never smokers to be open to using most examined products, as were men and adults aged 18-24 years. Receipt of tobacco industry promotions was associated with openness to using e-cigarettes; chew, snuff, or dip; and snus. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial openness to trying non-cigarette tobacco products among U.S. young adults. Young adults are an important population to consider for interventions targeting non-cigarette tobacco product use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking project (2012-2015) promoted modest financial and medication incentives to encourage Medi-Cal smokers to utilize the California Smokers' Helpline (Helpline). This article describes the implementation and impact of two different direct-to-member mailing approaches. METHODS: Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking promotional materials were mailed directly to members using two approaches: (1) household mailings: households identified through centralized membership divisions and (2) individually targeted mailings: smokers identified by medical codes from Medi-Cal managed care plans. Mailings included messaging on incentives, such as gift cards or nicotine patches. Number of calls per month, calls per unit mailed, and associated printing costs per call were compared during and 1 month after mailings. Activated caller response was based on reporting a household mailing promotional code or based on requesting financial incentives for individually targeted mailings. Analyses were conducted in 2018. RESULTS: Direct-to-member mailings, particularly with incentive messaging, demonstrated an increase in call volumes during and 1 month after mailing, and increased Medi-Cal calls to the Helpline per unit mailed. Mailings with only counseling messages had the lowest percentage of activated calls per unit mailed, whereas the incentive messaging mailings were consistently higher. Although household mailings demonstrated lower printing costs per call, individually targeted mailings had a higher percentage of activated calls per unit mailed. CONCLUSIONS: Household and individually targeted mailings are feasible approaches to increase Medi-Cal calls to the Helpline, particularly with incentive messaging. Choosing an approach and messaging depends on available resources, timing, and purpose.

The current study with California Medicaid members used a 2 × 2 design to directly assess the effects of offering free patches and incentives on calls to a quitline. The hypotheses were that offering either would make members more likely to call, and that offering both would increase demand even further. METHODS: Flyers were inserted into a mailing sent to 4,268,696 Medicaid households, with one of four offers: (1) free counseling; (2) counseling plus patches; (3) counseling plus a $20 gift card; and (4) counseling plus patches and gift card. Ninety percent received the first offer and 10% received one of the other three offers, in equal proportions. The mailers shipped late 2013 to early 2014. Data were collected 2013-2015 and analyzed 2018. RESULTS: Response rates were 0.029% for counseling, 0.115% for counseling plus patches, 0.122% for counseling plus gift card, and 0.200% for counseling, patches, and gift card. Both patches and gift cards had statistically significant effects (both p<0.001). Promotional costs were 59%-75% lower with an incentive. Non-whites responded more strongly than whites to a gift card offer. CONCLUSIONS: Offering either free patches or a $20 gift card quadrupled the likelihood of Medicaid smokers calling a quitline; offering both had a nearly additive effect. Incentive offers dramatically increased the cost-effectiveness of promotions. Piggybacking on existing Medicaid communications to promote cessation proved very successful.

This study examines whether more modest incentives to encourage engagement, non-contingent on outcomes, also increase cessation; whether sending medications directly to participants boosts quitting; and whether these strategies are effective in Medicaid. STUDY DESIGN: Three-group RCT of usual care (UC); nicotine patch (NP); and NP and financial incentive (NP+FI). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Medicaid beneficiaries calling the California Smokers' Helpline, 2012-2013 (N=3,816). Data were analyzed in 2017. INTERVENTION: All participants enrolled in evidence-based, multisession telephone counseling. All received proof of enrollment with which they could obtain free quitting aids at their pharmacy. NP and NP+FI also received nicotine patches sent to their homes. NP+FI received up to $60 for completing counseling calls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quit attempt rate, 7-day and 30-day abstinence at 2 and 7 months, and 6-month prolonged abstinence (primary outcome). RESULTS: In both complete-case and intention-to-treat analyses, outcomes trended upward from UC to NP to NP+FI. Differences between NP and UC were generally nonsignificant. By contrast, the NP+FI group significantly outperformed the other groups on all measures. In intention-to-treat analysis, compared with UC, NP+FI was more likely to make a quit attempt (68.4% vs 54.3%, p<0.001); be abstinent for 7 days at 2 months (36.1% vs 25.5%, p<0.001) and 7 months (21.2% vs 16.1%, p=0.002); be abstinent for 30 days at 2 months (30.0% vs 18.9%, p<0.001) and 7 months (21.5% vs 16.7%, p=0.004); and achieve 6-month prolonged abstinence (13.2% vs 9.0%, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Financial incentives increased treatment engagement and short- and long-term smoking cessation, despite being modest and non-contingent on outcomes. The study found that incentives can be effective in a Medicaid population, and can feasibly be integrated into existing quitline services.

The Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking program provided incentives to adults on Medi-Cal to call the California Smokers Helpline (Helpline) from March 2012 to July 2015. This analysis examined reach of the Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking program among pregnant and parenting women. METHODS: This study examined caller data from the Helpline from 2010 to 2015 among women of reproductive age (18-45 years) enrolled in Medi-Cal (n=32,691; analyzed in 2017/2018). The authors calculated the annual percentage of the target population reached who called the Helpline by pregnancy status and used adjusted prevalence ratios to examine the associations between Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking incentive period, pregnancy/parenting status, Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking incentives ($20 gift card and nicotine patch), and counseling. RESULTS: Over the study period, the percentage of the target population reached increased for women of reproductive age (2.1% in 2011 to 3.0% in 2014) and pregnant women (2.1% in 2011 to 3.3% in 2014). The percentage of women who asked for the $20 gift card (13.6%) was not substantially different by pregnancy status, and WIC and nonprofits were important referral sources. Pregnant women were less likely to receive nicotine patches, but there was a 3- to 4-fold increase during the Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking incentive period for both pregnant and nonpregnant women. Among nonpregnant women, counseling decreased 14% during the Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking incentive period. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the nicotine patch incentives motivated women to call the Helpline, even pregnant women who needed a physician's approval consistent with current American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists cautions about the appropriateness of the patch during pregnancy.

The goal of the California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) Incentives to Quit Smoking Program was to facilitate successful cessation by promoting modest financial and cessation medication-related incentives to increase engagement with the California Smokers' Helpline counseling services. Differences in the response to incentives and outreach on engagement with Helpline services among racial/ethnic groups within the Medi-Cal population were examined. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of Helpline caller data. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: African American (n=18,656); English-speaking Latinx (n=12,792); Spanish-speaking Latinx (n=3,254); and white (n=45,907) Medi-Cal callers. INTERVENTION: The Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking team conducted statewide and community-based outreach and facilitated direct-to-member all-household mailings about the Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking program to engage with Medi-Cal callers and promote Helpline services between March 2012 and July 2015 (analyzed 2017/2018). Medi-Cal callers could ask for a $20 gift card incentive after having completed a counseling session; in September 2013, callers were offered free nicotine replacement therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three behavioral outcomes are reported that reflect activated callers and callers who engaged in treatment that is proven to improve chances of quitting smoking: receipt of the $20 incentive, receipt of nicotine replacement therapy, and receipt of counseling. RESULTS: African Americans and English-speaking Latinx had higher engagement with the financial incentive than whites (African American APR=1.66, 95% CI=1.59, 1.73, English-speaking Latinx APR=1.29, 95% CI=1.22, 1.36). Spanish-speaking Latinx had lower initial engagement with the financial incentive (APR=0.75, 95% CI=0.66, 0.85), but higher engagement with Medi-Cal's all-household mailing (Spanish-speaking Latinx 30.6% vs whites 18.2%, p<0.001). Although African Americans and English-speaking Latinx had similar rates of completing counseling and receiving nicotine replacement therapy as whites, Spanish-speaking Latinx had higher rates than whites. CONCLUSIONS: The promotion of modest financial and cessation medication incentives through multiple outreach channels increased callers' engagement with the Helpline and appeared to promote ethnic and linguistic equity with respect to the receipt of counseling and nicotine replacement therapy. Targeted community-based outreach may resonate particularly for African Americans, and language-concordant Medi-Cal insurance plan mailings may have reached newly covered Spanish-speaking Latinx.

This study evaluates the impact of outreach through health channels on California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) quitline caller characteristics, trends, and reach. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Medi-Cal quitline callers. INTERVENTION: Statewide outreach was conducted with health providers, Medi-Cal plans (all-household mailings with tracking codes), and public health organizations (March 2012-July 2015). For incentives, Medi-Cal callers could ask for a $20 gift card; in September 2013, callers were offered free nicotine patches. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Caller characteristics were compared with chi-square analyses, joinpoint analysis of call trends was performed accounting for Medi-Cal population growth, referral source among Medi-Cal and non-Medi-Cal callers was documented, and the annual percentage of the population reached who called the Helpline was calculated. Analyses were conducted 2016-2018. RESULTS: Total Medi-Cal callers were 92,900, a 70% increase from prior annual averages: 12.4% asked for the financial incentive, 17.3% reported the mailing code, and 73.3% received nicotine patches while offered. Among the two thirds of callers who completed counseling, 15.5% asked for the financial incentive, and 13.6% reported the mailing code. A joinpoint analysis showed call trends increased 23% above expected for the Medi-Cal population growth after mailings to providers and members began, and decreased after outreach ended. Annual reach increased from 2.3% (95% CI=2.1, 2.6) in 2011 to peak at 4.5% (95% CI=3.6, 5.3) in 2014. Among subgroups with higher reach rates, some also had higher rates of asking for the financial incentive (African Americans, American Indian), reporting the tracking code (whites), or both (aged 45-64 years). Medi-Cal callers were more likely than non-Medi-Cal callers to report providers (32.3% vs 23.8%) and plans (19.7% vs 1.4%) as their referral source, and less likely to cite media (20.2% vs 44.4%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Statewide outreach through health channels incentivizing Medi-Cal members increased the utilization and reach of quitline services.

For novel health behaviors, such as the use of emerging tobacco products, limited empirical research on beliefs about these behaviors exists. A multimethod approach was applied to generate potential campaign beliefs for emerging behaviors. Three methods were conducted in this investigation in order to generate a list of potential testable campaign beliefs, using youth e-cigarette use as a case study: (1) a search of published and unpublished literature including gathering measures from several national surveys (through 2016), (2) an online elicitation survey (conducted in 2016), and (3) unsupervised topic modeling of media texts (from 2014 to 2015, analyzed in 2016). Details are provided on how each method was employed to both generate and prioritize beliefs related to youth e-cigarette use into a final set of 115 beliefs across 23 belief themes. This multimethod approach can provide four utilities when thinking through a health campaign for novel health behaviors: (1) developing an exhaustive and complementary list of beliefs, (2) generating overarching themes and distilling larger themes into more nuanced beliefs, (3) identifying language most relevant to the target population, and (4) prioritizing beliefs for message pilot testing with members of the target audience.

However, there is limited research exploring youth responses to addiction messages. This study assesses youths' responses to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's ""The Real Cost"" campaign messaging depicting addiction as a ""loss of control."" METHODS: Between 2013 and 2016, three focus group studies and four copy testing studies were conducted to assess reactions to advertising concepts and near-final videos. Participants were aged 12-17 years and ethnically and geographically diverse. Researchers conducted a thematic secondary analysis of focus group transcripts and open-ended survey questions from the copy testing studies. Data analysis for this study took place in 2017. RESULTS: Youth responded favorably to loss of control messages showing real, often short-term, consequences of addiction, such as choosing to spend money on cigarettes instead of going to a movie, and depictions of scenarios that were relatable to youth. Youth also responded favorably to messages describing how nicotine changes the brain. A portion of youth remained skeptical, stating they felt the consequences depicted were unrealistic. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that by framing addiction as a loss of control and tying that loss of control to short-term health and social consequences, addiction becomes more concrete and understandable, and the consequences feel more relatable and relevant to youth.

In the trial, alternative cessation treatment strategies were embedded in the state's ongoing quitline services. It found that modest financial incentives of up to $60 per participant and sending nicotine patches induced significantly higher cessation rates compared with usual care alone and usual care plus nicotine patches. Building upon that study, this study assessed potential population-level costs and benefits of integrating financial incentives and nicotine patches in a quitline setting for Medicaid smokers. A cost-benefit analysis was undertaken from the Medicaid program's perspective. The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model was used to simulate future healthcare expenditures over a 10-year horizon for each treatment strategy for a study cohort of California Medicaid enrollees who were aged 35-64 years in 2014 (n=2,452,000). To simulate potential population-level benefits under each treatment strategy, each treatment was applied to all active smokers in the study cohort (n=478,300). Sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying key parameters, such as cessation costs, discount rate, relapse rates, and time horizon. Adding both financial incentives and nicotine patches to usual quitline care would result in $15 million net savings over 10 years, with a benefit-cost ratio of 1.30 compared with the usual care plus nicotine patches strategy. It would yield $44 million net savings, with a benefit-cost ratio of 1.90 compared with usual care alone. The strategy of providing financial incentives and mailing nicotine patches directly to Medicaid smokers who call the quitline is cost saving.

It also presents 2014-2018 registration data (vaping in the past 30 days, number of use days, use for quitting smoking, and intentions to quit vaping) from 24 public quitlines (23 states and District of Columbia) and 110,295 enrollees to employer-sponsored quitlines. Trends in vaping rates over time, by state, and by age group are described. Approximately 57,000 adult public quitline enrollees in the U.S. reported vaping at registration in 2018 (14.7% of enrollees). Most quitline participants who vape also smoke cigarettes and contact the quitline for smoking cessation support. Rates of reporting vaping and no combustible or smokeless tobacco use in the past 30 days are 0.5% of all public quitline participants (<3% of public quitline vaping product users). Data are not systematically available regarding the number of quitline participants who are seeking help quitting vaping and only vape (do not use combustible or smokeless tobacco). Few quitline participants (<1%) are youth aged <18 years, but more than a third (35%) report vaping. This paper outlines research and evaluation priorities to inform the future quitline treatment landscape with respect to vaping. The quitline community is positioned to increase the likelihood that vaping has a positive impact for adults who smoke through harm reduction or supporting cessation and has opportunities to expand impacts on youth and young adult vaping prevention and cessation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

However, data on heated tobacco product awareness and use from population-based probability surveys are limited. This study examines heated tobacco product awareness and ever use among U.S. adults. METHODS: This study used data (n=42,477) from the 2019 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey, analyzed in 2020. Descriptive statistics, including a weighted prevalence of heated tobacco product awareness and ever use, were estimated. The awareness and ever use of heated tobacco products were also estimated by age, sex, cigarette smoking status, E-cigarette use status, and other tobacco product use status. Multivariable logistic regression examined the individual characteristics associated with the awareness and ever use of heated tobacco products. RESULTS: Overall, approximately 8.6% of U.S. adults were aware of heated tobacco products. Awareness was higher among participants who were younger, male, cigarette smokers, E-cigarette users, and other tobacco product users. Ever use of heated tobacco products was uncommon among U.S. adults (0.51%) but more prevalent among E-cigarette users and cigarette smokers. In the general adult populations, the odds of ever use of heated tobacco products were significantly higher among cigarette smokers (AOR=2.19, 95% CI=1.63, 2.94), E-cigarette smokers (AOR=2.70, 95% CI=1.71, 4.25), and other tobacco product users (AOR=1.69, 95% CI=1.30, 2.20). CONCLUSIONS: Although the ever use of heated tobacco products is uncommon among U.S. adults, recent regulatory approval of the marketing of IQOS as modified risk tobacco products may increase use. Therefore, ongoing monitoring of heated tobacco products use and their long-term health consequences are important for informing future decision making.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study assessed whether limiting characterizing flavors in combusted products only or across all tobacco products produces differential impacts on the tobacco use behaviors of African American/Black individuals who use menthol cigarettes. METHODS: Adult African American/Black individuals who use menthol cigarettes in the U.S. were recruited through Qualtrics (n=373) and in Richmond, VA (n=206) for an online experiment from September 2021 to August 2022. Participants reported how their tobacco use behaviors would change under 3 scenarios: maintenance of the status quo, limited flavor ban (ban characterizing flavors in cigarettes and cigars), and comprehensive flavor ban (ban characterizing flavors in all tobacco products). Seemingly unrelated regressions compared differences in expected responses to policy scenarios (p<0.05). RESULTS: Both flavor ban scenarios resulted in higher quitting intentions for cigarettes and all tobacco products than the status quo (p<0.05). The comprehensive ban resulted in greater intentions to quit all tobacco products and lower intentions to switch to certain alternative products (e.g., E-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, heated tobacco products) than the limited ban (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: African American/Black individuals who use menthol cigarettes appear more likely to quit smoking if characterizing flavors in combusted products (e.g., menthol cigarettes) are banned, regardless of if characterizing flavors are available in noncombusted alternative tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Accordingly, emergency department visits are an ideal time to initiate tobacco treatment and aftercare for this vulnerable and understudied population. This research estimates the costs per quit of emergency department smoking-cessation interventions and compares them with those of other approaches. METHODS: Previously published research described the effectiveness of 2 multicomponent smoking cessation interventions, including brief negotiated interviewing, nicotine replacement therapy, quitline referral, and follow-up communication. Study 1 (collected in 2010-2012) only analyzed the combined interventions. Study 2 (collected in 2017-2019) analyzed the intervention components independently. Costs per participant and per quit were estimated separately, under distinct intervention with dedicated staff and intervention with repurposed staff assumptions. The distinction concerns whether the intervention used dedicated staff for delivery or whether time from existing staff was repurposed for intervention if available. RESULTS: Data were analyzed in 2021-2022. In the first study, the cost per participant was $860 (2018 dollars), and the cost per quit was $11,814 (95% CI=$7,641, $25,423) (dedicated) and $227 per participant and $3,121 per quit (95% CI=$1,910, $7,012) (repurposed). In Study 2, the combined effect of brief negotiated interviewing, nicotine replacement therapy, and quitline cost $808 per participant and $6,100 per quit (dedicated) (95% CI=$4,043, $12,274) and $221 per participant and $1,669 per quit (95% CI=$1,052, $3,531) (repurposed).

Smoking, alcohol use, and illicit drugs are routinely documented in electronic health records, but less is known about screening for E-cigarette use and the prevalence of E-cigarette use in primary care settings. METHODS: Data include 134,931 adult patients who visited 1 of 41 primary care clinics within a 12-month period (June 1, 2021-June 1, 2022). Data on demographics, combustible tobacco, alcohol, illicit drug, and E-cigarette use were extracted from electronic medical records. Logistic regression was utilized to examine the variables associated with differential odds of being screened for E-cigarette use. RESULTS: Rates of E-cigarette screening (n=46,997; 34.8%) were significantly lower than that of tobacco (n=134,196; 99.5%), alcohol (n=129,766; 96.2%), and illicit drug (n=129,766; 92.6%) use. Of those assessed for E-cigarette use, 3.6% (n=1,669) reported current use. Of those with documented nicotine use (n=7,032), 17.2% (n=1,207) used mono E-cigarettes exclusively, 76.3% (n=5,364) used combustible tobacco exclusively, and 6.6% (n=461) reported dual use (both E-cigarette use and combustible tobacco use). Those who used combustible tobacco or illicit substances as well as younger patients were more likely to have been screened for E-cigarette use. CONCLUSIONS: Overall rates of E-cigarette screening were significantly lower than those of other substances. The use of combustible tobacco or illicit substances was associated with an increased likelihood of being screened. This finding may be because of the relatively recent proliferation of E-cigarettes, the recent addition of E-cigarette documentation to the electronic health record, or a lack of training on screening for E-cigarette use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study assessed differences in the substitution feasibility of menthol- and regular/tobacco-flavored IQOS for menthol cigarettes. STUDY DESIGN: This was an unblinded 2-week, parallel-group randomized pilot clinical trial. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Thirty adults who smoked menthol cigarettes in Richmond, VA completed clinical laboratory sessions (Monday and Friday) and reported at-home tobacco consumption. Data were collected from November 2022 to September 2023 and analyzed from October 2023 to February 2024. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to use IQOS 2.4 with fresh menthol (IQOS-M) or regular tobacco (IQOS-T) HeatSticks (1:1) during Week 2 of the study in the clinical laboratory and throughout the second week while they were at home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory visits involved 10-puff directed use bouts with puff topography, plasma nicotine measurement, subjective effects questionnaires, and the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace task. The primary outcome was the cross-price elasticity of IQOS in the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace at the final clinical laboratory session. Electronic daily diaries measured tobacco consumption at home. RESULTS: In the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace, the average (SD) cross-price elasticity for IQOS was 0.67 (0.09) when IQOS-M and IQOS-T were available concurrently versus 0.14 (0.03) when only IQOS-T was available (p<0.05). At home, participants reduced their typical cigarette consumption by 80% when they had access to IQOS-M versus 37% with IQOS-T (p<0.05). Differences in puff topography and nicotine delivery across IQOS flavors were not significant (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Access to menthol-flavored heated tobacco products is an important determinant of potential substitution for people who smoke menthol cigarettes but may not be sufficient to promote complete substitution. Tobacco regulatory policies that restrict access to menthol-flavored heated tobacco products could promote complete tobacco cessation but may reduce attempts to substitute with heated tobacco products among people who smoke menthol cigarettes.

The study goal was to assess U.S. adults' public opinions about health warning label policies on social media in general and for commercial tobacco/nicotine products specifically in response to a call from the U.S. Surgeon General on health warning label policies on social media. This study examined support by political party affiliation. METHODS: A nationally representative online survey was conducted in September 2024 among U.S. adults. Respondents indicated how much they strongly agreed (5) or strongly disagreed (1) with 5 statements about social media health warning labels, including mental health, influencer promotions, and tobacco/nicotine products. Log binomial regression models were constructed to estimate relative support prevalence by political affiliation. Analyses were conducted in 2024-2025. RESULTS: U.S. adults, regardless of political affiliation, generally supported social media health warning label policies, including agreeing/strongly agreeing that social media platforms should be required to have warning labels on posts promoting any tobacco product (81.2% of Democrats, 74.8% of Republicans). Democrats and Republicans were also closely aligned in support of influencer disclosures generally (82.9% and 80.5%, respectively) and in their support that social media platforms should do more to warn youth about the harms of vaping (82.4% and 77.2%, respectively). Democrats generally expressed the highest levels of support, whereas those who identified as independent or with no affiliation generally expressed the lowest levels of support. CONCLUSIONS: Adding sponsored content disclosures and health warning labels to social media platforms and related posts is generally supported by U.S. adults, showing promise for policy adoption and implementation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

They are designed to simulate smoking by heating a nicotine-containing solution producing an aerosol that the user inhales. The short- and long-term effects of e-cigarette use are still unclear, but their use is increasing. Some acute effects of e-cigarettes on heart rate, blood pressure, and airway resistance are reported. Although there are some reports of improved cessation in a subset of users, there are also studies reporting decreased cessation in dual users of regular and e-cigarettes. Additionally, there is no current regulation of these devices, and this allows virtually anyone with a form of online payment to obtain them.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) products are effective aids that improve rates of tobacco cessation. Many smokers interact with the medical system, such as during hospitalization, without their tobacco use addressed. Hospitalization is a teachable moment for patients to make health-related changes, including tobacco cessation. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of adult patients in a university-based patient-centered medical home from 2012 to 2021 evaluating the proportion of adults who smoke who received at least one prescription for NRT. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the association of being hospitalized and receipt of a NRT prescription. RESULTS: Of the 4,072 current smokers identified, 1,182 (29%) received at least one prescription for NRT during the study period. Hospitalization was associated with increased odds of receiving a NRT prescription (OR 1.68). Of 1,844 current smokers with a hospitalization during the study period, 1,078 (58%) never received a prescription for NRT at any point. Only 87 (5%) of the smokers received a prescription for NRT during hospitalization or at the time of hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Despite hospitalization being associated with NRT prescribing, most patients who use tobacco and are hospitalized are not prescribed NRT. Hospitalization is an underutilized opportunity for both hospitalists and primary care physicians to intervene on smoking cessation through education and prescription of tobacco cessation aids.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, trials typically use multicomponent interventions, making it difficult to distinguish specific components that are effective. In addition, interactions between components cannot be assessed. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy allows investigators to identify these effects. METHODS: We conducted a full-factorial, 24 or 16-condition optimization trial in a busy hospital ED to examine the performance of 4 tobacco dependence interventions: a brief negotiation interview; 6 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy with the first dose delivered in the ED; active referral to a telephone quitline; and enrollment in SmokefreeTXT, a free short-messaging service program. Study data were analyzed with a novel mixed methods approach to assess clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and qualitative participant feedback. The primary endpoint was tobacco abstinence at 3 months, verified by exhaled carbon monoxide using a Bedfont Micro+ Smokerlyzer. RESULTS: Between February 2017 and May 2019, we enrolled 1,056 adult smokers visiting the ED. Odd ratios (95% confidence intervals) from the primary analysis of biochemically confirmed abstinence rates at 3 months for each intervention, versus control, were: brief negotiation interview, 1.8 (1.1, 2.8); nicotine replacement therapy, 2.1 (1.3, 3.2); quitline, 1.4 (0.9, 2.2); SmokefreeTXT, 1.1 (0.7, 1.7). There were no statistically significant interactions among components. Economic and qualitative analyses are in progress. CONCLUSION: The brief negotiation interview and nicotine replacement therapy were efficacious. This study is the first to identify components of ED-initiated tobacco dependence treatment that are individually effective. Future work will address the scalability of the brief negotiation interview and nicotine replacement therapy by offering provider-delivered brief negotiation interviews and nicotine replacement therapy prescriptions.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: This case study profiled 10 authors' (identified by expert panel) COIs pertaining to the tobacco industry; identified the 10 authors' publications (2010-2021); and assessed the transparency of the COI declarations within the publications. RESULTS: All authors received indirect or direct funding from the tobacco industry. On review of the authors' 553 publications, 61% of COI and funding declarations were accessible, 33% were partially accessible and 6% were inaccessible. Overall, 33% of authors provided complete COI declarations, 51% provided incomplete declarations, and 16% provided no declaration. CONCLUSION: This research demonstrates existing guidelines and recommendations for reporting COI declarations are not sufficiently robust to ensure transparency in reporting of COI declarations within the field. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH: Research outcomes have the potential to define public health discourse and influence public opinion, practices, and policy. It is critical that research remains independent and protected from the influence of the tobacco industry. Processes for monitoring and enforcing accurate reporting of COI declarations are needed.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study examines the association between cessation fatigue and duration of abstinence among 1397 adult former smokers who participated in the 2016 International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Smoking and Vaping Wave 1 Survey (4CV). We hypothesized lower levels of cessation fatigue will be correlated with longer duration of abstinence. METHOD: Data for this cross-sectional study were collected in a web-based survey which recruited national samples from Australia, Canada, England, and United States. Former smokers were abstinent up to five years. RESULTS: Lower cessation fatigue was associated with longer duration of smoking abstinence. Cessation fatigue was highest in former smokers that had been quit for up to six months, with lower cessation fatigue found in those quit for at least seven months and another drop-off in fatigue observed for those quit for at least two years. CONCLUSIONS: Cessation fatigue is highest soon after quitting smoking but declines over time for those who remain abstinent. Understanding the mechanisms by which cessation fatigue is related to abstinence could potentially offer insights into ways to help individuals sustain quitting.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

There is a large amount of evidence implicating the insula in nicotine addiction. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) directed to the insular cortex with the H11 coil, relative to sham stimulation, on smoking abstinence and smoking outcomes in smokers who are receiving standard varenicline treatment. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, sham controlled trial recruited 42 participants who were randomized to receive either active (n = 24) or sham (n = 18) high frequency rTMS directed to the insula (4 weeks), while receiving varenicline treatment (12 weeks). The primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence abstinence at the end of 12 weeks. RESULTS: Smokers in the active group had significantly higher abstinence rates than those in the sham group (82.4% vs. 30.7%, p = 0.013) at the end of treatment (Week 12). Secondary outcome measures of abstinence rate at the end of rTMS treatment (Week 4), abstinence rate at 6 months, and smoking outcomes (e.g., craving, withdrawal) showed no significant differences between groups. No differences were found in adverse events reported between the groups. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of the potential benefit of having a combined treatment for smoking cessation using insula rTMS with the H11 coil and varenicline. Maintenance rTMS sessions and continuation of varenicline for those in abstinence may induce longer-term effects and should be considered in future studies.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Smokers are disproportionately from lower socioeconomic groups, and may use the hospital emergency department (ED) as an important source of care. A recent clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of a multicomponent intervention to help smokers quit, but the independent contributions of those components is unknown. METHODS: This is a full-factorial (16-arm) randomized trial in a busy hospital ED of 4 tobacco dependence interventions: brief motivational interviewing, nicotine replacement therapy, referral to a telephone quitline, and a texting program. The trial utilizes the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) and a novel mixed methods analytic design to assess clinical efficacy, cost effectiveness, and qualitative participant feedback. The primary endpoint is tobacco abstinence at 3months, verified by participants' exhaled carbon monoxide. RESULTS: Study enrollment began in February 2017. As of April 2017, 52 of 1056 planned participants (4.9%) were enrolled. Telephone-based semi-structured participant interviews and in-person biochemical verification of smoking abstinence are completed at the 3-month follow-up. Efficacy and cost effectiveness analyses will be conducted after follow-up is completed. DISCUSSION: The goal of this study is to identify a clinically efficacious, cost-effective intervention package for the initial treatment of tobacco dependence in ED patients. The efficacy of this combination can then be tested in a subsequent confirmatory trial. Our approach incorporates qualitative feedback from study participants in evaluating which intervention components will be tested in the future trial.

Using telemedicine, this study aims to identify culturally-tailored, theoretically-driven, efficacious interventions for tobacco use and other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk behaviors among AN people in remote areas. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial with two intervention arms: 1) tobacco and physical activity; 2) medication adherence and a heart-healthy AN diet. PARTICIPANTS: Participants are N = 300 AN men and women current smokers with high blood pressure or high cholesterol. INTERVENTIONS: All participants receive motivational, stage-tailored, telemedicine-delivered counseling sessions at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up; an individualized behavior change plan that is updated at each contact; and a behavior change manual. In Group 1, the focus is on tobacco and physical activity; a pedometer is provided and nicotine replacement therapy is offered. In Group 2, the focus is on medication adherence for treating hypertension and/or hypercholesterolemia; a medication bag and traditional food guide are provided. MEASUREMENTS: With assessments at baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, the primary outcome is smoking status, assessed as 7-day point prevalence abstinence, biochemically verified with urine anabasine. Secondary outcomes include physical activity, blood pressure and cholesterol, medication compliance, diet, multiple risk behavior change indices, and cost-effectiveness. COMMENTS: The current study has the potential to identify novel, feasible, acceptable, and efficacious interventions for treating the co-occurrence of CVD risk factors in AN people. Findings may inform personalized treatment and the development of effective and cost-effective intervention strategies for use in remote indigenous communities more broadly.

We demonstrated, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 342 adult smokers receiving inpatient psychiatric care, that an in-person, motivational interviewing (MI)-based, Sustained Care (SusC) intervention vs. Usual Care (UC) resulted in significantly higher rates of confirmed smoking abstinence at 6-months post-hospital discharge and significantly increased smoking cessation treatment utilization. While successful, this SusC intervention would be challenging to implement broadly in psychiatric hospitals. The current efficacy trial will develop and test an MI-based Sustained Care intervention delivered as a mobile app for iPad and will determine whether this approach can produce higher cessation rates compared to usual care for smokers admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit. METHODS: A total of 250 eligible patients hospitalized for psychiatric illness will be randomized to: Tablet-delivered Sustained Care (T-SusC) or Usual Care (UC), and will be followed for six months after discharge. Participants assigned to UC will receive brief, in-hospital tobacco education. Those assigned to T-SusC will receive the brief tobacco education, plus a 40-min, in-hospital MI intervention delivered via a mobile application (app) for iPad use. They will also receive up to 8 weeks of free nicotine patches and a referral to the Texas Tobacco Quitline. Smoking cessation outcomes will be measured at 1-, 3- and 6-months post hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: Results from this efficacy trial may add to our understanding of acceptable and effective smoking cessation approaches for patients hospitalized with SMI.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

A,"Chiral determination of nornicotine, anatabine and anabasine in tobacco by achiral gas chromatography with (1S)-(-)-camphanic chloride derivatization: Application to enantiomeric profiling of cultivars and curing processes.","The alkaloid enantiomers are well-known to have different physiological and pharmacological effects, and to play an important role in enantioselectivity metabolism with enzymes catalysis in tobacco plants. Here, we developed an improved method for simultaneous and high-precision determination of the individual enantiomers of nornicotine, anatabine and anabasine in four tobacco matrices, based on an achiral gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphorus detector (GCNPD) with commonly available Rtx-200 column using (1S)-(-)-camphanic chloride derivatization. The method development consists of the optimization of extraction and derivatization, screening of achiral column, analysis of the fragmentation mechanisms and evaluation of matrix effect (ME). Under the optimized experimental conditions, the current method exhibited excellent detection capability for the alkaloid enantiomers, with coefficients of determination (R2) > 0.9989 and normality test of residuals P > 0.05 in linear regression parameters. The ME can be neglected for the camphanic derivatives. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) ranged from 0.087 to 0.24 μg g - 1 and 0.29 to 0.81 μg g - 1, respectively. The recoveries and within-laboratory relative standard deviations (RSDR) were 94.3%~104.2% and 0.51%~3.89%, respectively. The developed method was successfully applied to determine the enantiomeric profiling of cultivars and curing processes. Tobacco cultivars had a significant impact on the nornicotine, anatabine, anabasine concentration and enantiomeric fraction (EF) of (R)-nornicotine, whereas the only significant change induced by the curing processes was an increase in the EF of (R)-anabasine.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

With smoking rates already high in most of the Third World, however, the projections for the twenty-first century are grim: up to 1 billion tobacco-caused deaths, which raises the issue of what more can be done, particularly to help people who already are addicted to nicotine. Only massive and effective smoking cessation programs could reduce this death toll significantly, at least in the short-term. Tobacco control's existing tools, if widely applied, likely will reduce premature deaths significantly but can be expected to leave unacceptably high levels of tobacco-related mortality. This finding has sparked fierce discussions among anti-tobacco activists about the role of harm reduction in curbing death and disease. This article discusses whether harm reduction is possible with the tobacco industry subject to a largely unregulated environment for tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

An alternative strategy is to adapt pharmacotherapy based on non-response. A handful of studies have examined this approach, but they have adapted pharmacotherapy only once and/or focused on adaptation distal rather than proximal to a failed quit attempt. Few studies have included racial/ethnic minorities who have less success in quitting and bear a disproportionate share of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. METHODS: The current study is comparing the efficacy of optimized (OPT) versus enhanced usual care (UC) for smoking cessation in African Americans (AA) who smoke cigarettes. AAs who smoke (n = 392) are randomized 1:1 to OPT or UC. Participants in both groups receive 7 sessions of smoking cessation counseling and18-weeks of pharmacotherapy with long-term follow-up through Week 26. OPT participants receive nicotine patch and up to two pharmacotherapy adaptations to varenicline and bupropion plus patch based on carbon monoxide verified smoking status (≥6 ppm) at Weeks 2 and 6. UC participants receive patch throughout the duration of treatment. We hypothesize that OPT will be more effective than UC on the primary outcome of biochemically verified abstinence at Week 12. DISCUSSION: If effective, findings could broaden the scope of tobacco dependence treatment and move the field toward optimization strategies that impro ve abstinence for AA who smoke.

Of critical importance are rapid new approach methodologies to enable the screening of next generation products (NGPs) also known as next generation tobacco and nicotine products. In this study, the activity of conventional cigarette (3R4F) smoke and a range of NGP aerosols (heated tobacco product, hybrid product and electronic vapor product) captured in phosphate buffered saline, were screened by exposing a panel of human cell-based model systems using Biologically Multiplexed Activity Profiling (BioMAP® Diversity PLUS® Panel, Eurofins Discovery). Following exposure, the biological activity for a wide range of biomarkers in the BioMAP panel were compared to determine the presence of toxicity signatures that are associated with specific clinical findings. NGP aerosols were found to be weakly active in the BioMAP Diversity PLUS Panel (≤3/148 biomarkers) whereas significant activity was observed for 3R4F (22/148 biomarkers). Toxicity associated biomarker signatures for 3R4F included immunosuppression, skin irritation and thrombosis, with no toxicity signatures seen for the NGPs. BioMAP profiling could effectively be used to differentiate between complex mixtures of cigarette smoke or NGP aerosol extracts in a panel of human primary cell-based assays. Clinical validation of these results will be critical for confirming the utility of BioMAP for screening NGPs for potential adverse human effects.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Imperial Brands'],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

This study examined adoption of tobacco-related policy and practices in six residential programs participating in a California-sponsored, 18-month, tobacco-free policy intervention. METHODS: Directors (N=6) completed surveys of tobacco-related policies before and after the intervention. Staff completed cross-sectional surveys assessing tobacco-related training, beliefs, practices, workplace smoking policy, tobacco cessation program services, and smoking status pre- (n=135) and post-intervention (n=144). RESULTS: Director surveys indicated no programs had tobacco-free grounds, one provided tobacco-related staff training, and two provided nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) pre-intervention. At post-intervention, 5 programs had implemented tobacco-free grounds, 6 provided tobacco cessation training, and 3 provided NRT. Across all programs, staff were more likely to report smoke-free workplaces (AOR = 5.76, 95% CI1.14,29.18) post- versus pre-intervention. Staff positive beliefs towards addressing tobacco use were higher post-intervention (p<0.001). Odds of clinical staff reporting tobacco-related training participation (AOR = 19.63, 95% CI14.21,27.13) and program-level provision of NRT (AOR = 4.01, 95% CI 1.54, 10.43) increased post- versus pre-intervention. Clinical staff reporting they provided tobacco cessation services were also higher post-intervention (p= 0.045). There were no changes in smoking prevalence or quit intention among smoking staff. CONCLUSION: A tobacco-free policy intervention in SUD treatment was associated with implementation of tobacco-free grounds, tobacco-related training among staff, more positive staff beliefs towards and delivery of tobacco cessation services to clients. The model may be improved with greater emphasis on staff policy awareness, facilitating availability of NRT, and reducing staff smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

This is not explained simply by the addictiveness (""abuse liability"") or by enticing product designs (""product appeal"") alone, but rather by both of these factors in combination with marketing and social influences that also influence ""product appeal"". A working meeting of leading experts in abuse liability (AL) and product appeal was convened to examine how these disciplines could be more effectively applied to the evaluation of tobacco products for the purposes of regulation that would include setting standards for designs and contents intended to reduce the risk of initiation and dependence. It was concluded that abuse liability assessment (ALA) is a validated approach to testing pharmaceutical products but has not been extensively applied to tobacco products: such application has demonstrated feasibility, but special challenges include the diverse range of products, product complexity, and the absence of satisfactory placebo products. Consumer testing for product appeal is widely used by consumer product marketers as well as by researchers in their efforts to understand consumer product preferences and use but has not been extensively applied to tobacco products except by the tobacco industry. Recommendations for testing, methods development, and research were developed. A major recommendation was that tobacco products should be tested for AL and product appeal, and the results integrated and evaluated so as to more accurately predict risk of initiation, dependence, and persistence of use.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

METHODS: The objective of this study was to measure serum nicotine levels and ad libitum smoking behavior for 24+2h using the CReSS micro topography device in 75 smokers with schizophrenia (SCZ) and compare these to 86 control smokers (CON) without mental illness. Mean values of repeatedly measured topography variables were compared using three-level nested linear models to adjust for between subject differences and the double nested data. RESULTS: Smokers with SCZ smoked more cigarettes in the 24h period and took an average of 2.8 more puffs per cigarette than CON (p<0.001). The time between puffs, or interpuff interval (IPI), was shorter in SCZ by an average of 6.5s (p<0.001). The peak flow rate was higher in SCZ by an average of 4.9 ml/s (p<0.05). Smokers with SCZ spent an average of 1.0 min less time smoking a single cigarette vs. CON (p<0.001). Smokers with SCZ also had shorter IPI and more puffs per cigarette in an analysis of first cigarette of the day. For all subjects, a decrease in IPI by 1s was associated with an increase in serum nicotine of 0.19 ng/ml and in cotinine of 5.01 ng/ml (both p<0.05). After controlling for diagnosis group, higher craving scores on QSU Factor 2 (urgent desire to smoke) were associated with shorter IPI. DISCUSSION: Smokers with schizophrenia demonstrate more intense cigarette puffing that is associated with greater nicotine intake. This pattern may provide insight into other heavily dependent smokers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Chemosensory cues generated by variations in cigarette product design features may serve as conditioned cues to allow the smoker to optimize nicotine delivery by adjusting puffing topography. Internal tobacco industry research documents were reviewed to understand the influence of sensory cues on puffing topography, and to examine how the tobacco industry has designed cigarettes, including modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs), to enhance puffing behavior to optimize nicotine delivery and product acceptability. METHODS: Relevant internal tobacco industry documents were identified using systematic searching with key search terms and phrases, and then snowball sampling method was applied to establish further search terms. RESULTS: Modern cigarettes are designed by cigarette manufacturers to provide sensory characteristics that not only maintain appeal, but provide cues which inform puffing intensity. Alterations in the chemosensory cues provided in tobacco smoke play an important role in modifying smoking behavior independently of the central effects of nicotine. CONCLUSIONS: An associative learning model is proposed to explain the influence of chemosensory cues on variation in puffing topography. These cues are delivered via tobacco smoke and are moderated by design features and additives used in cigarettes. The implications for regulation of design features of modified risk tobacco products, which may act to promote intensive puffing while lowering risk perceptions, are discussed.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

To inform treatment needs, the current study sought to describe tobacco dependence, motivations to quit and associated sociodemographic factors among young people seen in mental health settings. METHODS: Sixty adolescent and young adult smokers (age mean=19.5 years, range 13-25) receiving outpatient mental health treatment completed measures of tobacco dependence, motivation to quit smoking, mental health, and social environmental factors. RESULTS: Participants averaged 8.0 cigarettes per day (SD=6.6) and moderate nicotine dependence (mFTQ M=4.8, SD=1.6). Participants' mean rating (10-point scales) of perceived difficulty with avoiding relapse during a quit attempt was significantly higher (M=6.7, SD=2.6), than ratings of desire (M=5.1, SD=2.6) and perceived success (M=4.6, SD=2.6) with quitting. Over half (52%) did not intend to quit smoking in the next 6 months, and few (11%) were prepared to quit in the next 30 days. Mental health treatment and symptomatology measures were unrelated to level of dependence or motivation to quit. Among the social environmental factors, having close friends who smoke was associated with greater perceived difficulty with avoiding relapse during a quit attempt (r=0.25, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of adolescent and young adult smokers in mental health treatment, moderate levels of tobacco dependence and motivation to quit were observed and found to be unrelated to mental health measures. Over half of the sample was not intending to quit smoking in the near future, supporting the need for treatment strategies aimed at increasing motivation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

This study sought to determine whether an association between smoking and drinking could be observed at an implicit level using a novel cognitive bias task, as well as characterize the relationship between performance on this task and clinically relevant variables (i.e., heaviness of use/dependence). METHODS: Individuals (N=51) with a range of smoking and drinking patterns completed a modified Stroop task in which participants identified the color of drinking, smoking and neutral words that were each preceded by drinking, smoking or neutral picture primes. Participants also provided information regarding the heaviness of their smoking and drinking behavior and completed self-report measures of alcohol and nicotine dependence. RESULTS: Response times to smoking and drinking words were significantly slowed following the presentation of either smoking or drinking picture primes. This effect did not differ across subgroups. However, the strength of the coupling between smoking and drinking prime effects was greater among heavier drinkers, who also exhibited a concordant looser coupling of the effects of smoking and drinking primes on smoking words. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between smoking and drinking can be observed at an implicit level and may be strongest for heavier drinkers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Behavioral economics, which involves the integration of psychology and consumer demand, can be used to measure individuals' purchase behavior under different marketplace conditions. Our goal was to measure hypothetical conventional cigarette and e-cigarette purchasing among smokers with varying e-cigarette use patterns. METHODS: Daily cigarette smokers were recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing tool. Participants were asked about their frequency of e-cigarette use and to complete hypothetical single and cross-commodity purchase tasks. RESULTS: Frequency of e-cigarette use differentially affected how individuals consumed both conventional and e- cigarettes in different hypothetical marketplace conditions. The present study demonstrates four main findings: 1) the demand for conventional cigarettes was the lowest in those with greater frequency of e-cigarette use, 2) the demand for e-cigarettes was the highest in those with greater frequency of e-cigarette use, 3) when both products were available together, daily e-cigarette users purchased more e-cigarettes, but e-cigarettes served as a substitute for cigarettes in all groups regardless of frequency of use, and 4) the demand for conventional cigarette demand was lower in frequent e-cigarette users when e-cigarettes were concurrently available. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data suggest that price and marketplace conditions will impact purchasing behavior of conventional and e-cigarettes users heterogeneously. Therefore, frequency of use patterns should be considered when implementing novel policies and/or marketplace changes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Despite the high cigarette smoking rates observed in opioid users, no data have been reported on NMR among this population as they has been largely excluded from previous studies that have examined the relationship between tobacco use characteristics and rate of nicotine metabolism. METHODS: A linear regression model was used to examine the relationship between tobacco use characteristics and NMR among smokers taking buprenorphine for opioid dependency (N=141). The relationship between buprenorphine dose and NMR was also examined. All participants were enrolled in an intervention designed to promote cigarette-smoking cessation, though participants did not need to stop smoking to enroll. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Rate of nicotine metabolism assessed using the NMR was positively associated with cigarettes smoked in the past 24h, but was not related to time to first cigarette or past year quit attempts. Dose of buprenorphine was not associated with NMR, suggesting no association with rate of nicotine metabolism. Our results suggest that NMR is related to tobacco use among persons enrolled in opioid treatment, as reported in general population smokers and may be a useful biomarker to include in future research assessing efficacy of tobacco cessation interventions in this population.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Nicotine levels were nominally 18mg/mL in the strawberry (pH 8.29) and tobacco (pH 9.10) e-liquids and ranged between 3-18mg/mL in the usual brands (mean pH 6.80). Each day consisted of a 15-puff session followed by 4h of abstinence, then 90min of ad libitum use. Subjects used a KangerTech mini ProTank 3. RESULTS: After 15 puffs, the amount of nicotine inhaled and systemically retained were not significantly different between the strawberry and tobacco e-liquids but plasma AUC(0→180) was significantly higher with the strawberry e-liquid. While not significantly different, Cmax was 22% higher and various early time point AUCs to measure rate of rise of nicotine in blood ranged between 17 and 23% higher with the strawberry e-liquid compared to the tobacco e-liquid. During ad libitum use, systemic exposure to nicotine (AUC(0→90)) was the same for the tobacco and usual brand e-liquids but were both significantly lower than after using the strawberry e-liquid. The usual flavors were more liked and satisfying than the strawberry and tobacco e-liquids. CONCLUSION: Flavors influence nicotine exposure through flavor liking, may affect rate of nicotine absorption possibly through pH effects, and contribute to heart rate acceleration and subjective effects of e-cigarettes. E-cigarette users titrate their nicotine exposure but the extent of titration may vary across flavors.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, the influence of the two primary ECIG liquid solvents, propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG), on ECIG acute effects is unknown. METHODS: Thirty ECIG-experienced, ≥12-h nicotine- abstinent participants completed four conditions consisting of two ECIG-use bouts (10 puffs, 30 s interpuff-interval) differing only by liquid PG:VG ratio (2PG:98VG, 20PG:80VG, 55PG:45VG, 100PG). Device power (7.3 W) and liquid nicotine concentration (18 mg/ml) remained constant. Nicotine delivery, subjective effects, heart rate (HR), and puff topography were assessed. RESULTS: In the 100PG condition, participants took shorter and smaller puffs but obtained significantly more nicotine relative to the two VG-based conditions. Total nicotine exposure (i.e., area under the curve) was also significantly higher during use of the two PG-based liquids. However, participants reported that the 100 PG liquid was significantly less ""pleasant"" and ""satisfying"" relative to the other liquids (all ps < .05). Increases in HR and decreases in abstinence symptoms (e.g., ""craving"") did not differ across conditions. CONCLUSIONS: PG:VG ratio influenced nicotine delivery, some subjective effects, and puff topography. Lower overall product satisfaction associated with the 100PG liquid suggests factors other than nicotine delivery (e.g., aerosol visibility) may play a role in maintaining ECIG use. Regulating ECIG acute effects such as nicotine delivery and subjective effects may require simultaneous attention to liquid PG:VG ratio as well as device, liquid, and behavioral factors known to influence these outcomes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: 11 males and 3 females participated in a 3-day inpatient crossover study using e-cigarettes with strawberry, tobacco, and their usual brand e-liquid. Nicotine levels were nominally 18 mg/mL in the strawberry and tobacco e-liquids and ranged between 3-18 mg/mL in the usual brands. On each day, participants had access to the study e-cigarette (KangerTech mini ProTank 3, 1.5 Ohms, 3.7 V) and the assigned e-liquid during a 90-minute videotaped ad libitum session. RESULTS: Average puff duration was significantly longer when using the strawberry e-liquid (3.2 ± 1.3 s, mean ± SD) compared to the tobacco e-liquid (2.8 ± 1.1 s) but the average number of puffs was not significantly different (strawberry, 73 ± 35; tobacco, 69 ± 46). Compared to the strawberry- and tobacco-flavored e-liquids, average puff duration was significantly longer (4.3 ± 1.6 s) and the average number of puffs was significantly higher (106 ± 67 puffs) when participants used their usual brand of e-liquid. Participants generally puffed more frequently in small groups of puffs (1-5 puffs) with the strawberry compared to the tobacco e-liquid and more frequently in larger groups (>10 puffs) with their usual brand. The strength of the relationship between vaping topography and nicotine intake and exposure were not consistent across e-liquids. CONCLUSION: Vaping behavior changes across e-liquids and influences nicotine intake. Research is needed to understand the mechanisms that underlie these behavioral changes, including e-liquid pH and related sensory effects, subjective liking, and nicotine effects.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The relationship between varenicline adherence, determined by commonly used indirect (i.e., self-reported pill counts) and infrequently used direct (i.e., varenicline levels) methods, and abstinence outcomes have not been previously examined, nor has their impact on the outcomes of a genetically randomized clinical trial been assessed. METHODS: At Week 1 following target quit date, self-reported pill count and salivary varenicline levels were obtained from participants (N = 376) in a smoking cessation clinical trial (NCT01314001). Point-prevalence abstinence was biochemically-verified by salivary cotinine at Week 1 and by exhaled carbon monoxide at Week 1, end-of-treatment, 6 and 12 months following treatment. Blood nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) was obtained at baseline. RESULTS: Adherent individuals based on varenicline levels were significantly more likely to be abstinent than non-adherent individuals at Week 1 (odds ratios [ORs] 1.92-3.16, p's≤0.006), end-of-treatment (OR = 2.53, p = .004), and six months following treatment (OR = 2.30, p = .03). In contrast, pill counts did not consistently predict abstinence. Including direct measures of adherence enhanced the association between rate of nicotine metabolism (NMR) and end-of-treatment abstinence; normal metabolizers (NMR ≥ 0.31) were significantly more likely than slow metabolizers (NMR < 0.31) to be abstinent at end-of-treatment (OR = 2.00, p = .005). CONCLUSION: Adherence based on salivary varenicline, rather than on pill counts, is predictive of Week 1 abstinence, irrespective of the biomarker of abstinence assessed, and of long-term abstinence. Direct measures of adherence enhance the ability to assess the impact of a biomarker or genetic marker on abstinence outcomes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

This study examined whether ever tobacco use predicted subsequent substance use, and ever substance use predicted subsequent tobacco use among 11,996 U.S. youth (12-17 years) from Waves 1 (2013-2014) and 2 (2014-2015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. METHODS: Ever use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, traditional cigars, cigarillos, filtered cigars, pipe, hookah, snus pouches, smokeless tobacco excluding snus pouches, dissolvable tobacco, bidis, kreteks, alcohol, marijuana, prescription drugs, and other drugs (cocaine and other stimulants, heroin, inhalants, solvents, and hallucinogens) was assessed at Wave 1 followed by past 12-month use assessments at Wave 2. The analyses included covariates (demographics, mental health, sensation seeking, prior use) to mitigate confounding. RESULTS: Ever tobacco use predicted subsequent substance use. The magnitude of the associations was lowest for alcohol, higher for marijuana, and highest for other drugs. Ever substance use also predicted subsequent tobacco use. Specifically, ever alcohol, marijuana, and non-prescribed Ritalin/Adderall use predicted tobacco-product use. Ever e-cigarette and cigarette use exclusively and concurrently predicted subsequent any drug (including and excluding alcohol) use. E-cigarette and cigarette use associations in the opposite direction were also significant; the strongest associations were observed for exclusive cigarette use. CONCLUSION: Tobacco and substance use prevention efforts may benefit from comprehensive screening and interventions across tobacco products, alcohol, and drugs, and targeting risk factors shared across substances.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

However, little work has quantified delay discounting in relation to electronic cigarette (EC) use, a tobacco product that many users believe to pose fewer negative health consequences than cigarettes. METHODS: We assessed discounting of delayed monetary rewards in a web-based sample of 976 participants, stratified by both EC use (current and never) and cigarette use (current, former, and never). RESULTS: Controlling for demographic variance, current EC users generally showed greater discounting than never EC users (p = .019). Current cigarette smokers also showed greater discounting than former and never smokers (p < .001). However, the between-group difference for EC use was much smaller (ηp2 = .006) than for cigarette use (ηp2 = .026). Moreover, differences in discounting in relation to EC use were not statistically apparent in most pairwise comparisons. Most notably, the difference between former smokers who achieved smoking cessation by transitioning to ECs (i.e., exclusive EC users) and those who have never used ECs or cigarettes was nonsignificant and small (ηp2 = .010). CONCLUSIONS: The smaller effect size for the association between delay discounting and current EC use, relative to current cigarette use, suggests that public perception of ECs as a safer alternative to cigarettes attenuates the role of delay discounting in decisions to use ECs.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Here, we examined associations between exposure to e-liquid packaging with cartoons (operationally defined as recognition of actual marketing images) and e-cigarette use, susceptibility to use, and expectations of benefits and risks of use. METHODS: U.S. adults completed online surveys assessing e-cigarette use. In Study 1, participants (N = 778; Mean age = 23.5 years; 62% women) completed a questionnaire assessing expectations about benefits and risks of use. Then they were presented with 22 e-liquid package images (with and without cartoons) and were asked to endorse whether they recognized the products. In Study 2, participants (N = 522; Mean age = 30.4; 55% women) were presented with 24 e-liquid images (with and without cartoons) and asked to rate product appeal. RESULTS: For Study 1, among never users, cartoon recognition was associated with greater likelihood of being susceptible to use e-cigarettes, and with expectations of taste enjoyment and social facilitation. For Study 2, there was no significant difference between cartoon and non-cartoon images on appeal ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Cartoon-based marketing exposure - as measured by recognition of e-liquid package images - was associated with susceptibility to use e-cigarettes, which is consistent with previous research on the use of cartoons to promote combustible cigarettes. These data suggest that restrictions on the use of cartoon-based marketing strategies for e-cigarettes should be similar to those for cigarettes, to reduce susceptibility and perceived benefits among non-users.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Nicotine has a high affinity for melanin, and it has been hypothesized that melanin levels might influence nicotine pharmacokinetics and enhance dependence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that melanin affects nicotine disposition kinetics in humans. METHODS: Forty-four Black participants were administered intravenous infusions of deuterium-labeled nicotine and cotinine. Plasma concentrations of nicotine and cotinine were measured, and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated. The constitutive and facultative melanin indexes were measured using a dermaspectrophotometer. RESULTS: The median constitutive melanin index was 60.7 (32.8-134.7) and the median facultative melanin index 68.1 (38.6-127.1). The mean (±SD) nicotine elimination half-life was 136 min (±33.5), clearance was 1237 mL/min (±331), and Vss was 204 L (±66), or 2.6 L/kg (±0.7). No evidence of significant differences was found in nicotine pharmacokinetic parameters by comparing participants in different melanin index quartiles (outliers with very high melanin index had similar pharmacokinetic values to others). Differences were not statistically significant when adjusted for age, BMI, sex and CYP2A6 genotype or the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), and no evidence of significant correlations were found between melanin (facultative or constitutive) and the pharmacokinetic parameters of nicotine or cotinine or tobacco dependence measures. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our finding in this group of Black smokers, we could not confirm the hypothesis that melanin significantly affects nicotine disposition kinetics or measures of tobacco dependence.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

METHODS: JUUL users participated in a community-based study involving questionnaires, saliva collection and a qualitative interview. RESULTS: Fifteen participants were enrolled (80% male, 53% White) and had an average age of 29.8 (standard deviation = 10) years. Daily exposure to nicotine assessed via salivary cotinine was similar to those reported for other e-cigarette and tobacco cigarette users in general. The majority reported low to moderate nicotine dependence. Qualitative interview themes included: the importance of social networks in adoption and use of the product; device features such as small size and vapor cloud reinforced product use; the product provided satisfaction compared to a tobacco cigarette; and a perceived sense of addiction to the product. CONCLUSIONS: JUUL e-cigarettes expose users to levels of nicotine similar to other e-cigarettes but may be more satisfying due to unique device features. JUUL may be quite acceptable to tobacco cigarette smokers who are seeking to quit. However, it holds addictive potential and can reinforce long-term nicotine use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study aimed to evaluate the extent to which ECIG liquid flavor and nicotine concentration influenced subjective measures of abuse liability among young adult cigarette (cig) smokers. METHODS: Young adult (18-21 y.o.) smokers (M = 10.1 cig/day, no regular ECIG use history) completed 7 Latin-square ordered conditions each preceded by 12 h. nicotine/tobacco abstinence. Conditions were own brand cig (OB) and eGo-style ECIG paired with three liquid flavors (cream, tropical fruit, tobacco/menthol) varying in nicotine concentration (0 or 36 mg/ml). Products were administered in two 10-puff bouts in each condition. Heart rate/blood pressure (HR/BP) and tobacco/nicotine abstinence symptoms, nicotine/general drug effects, and acceptability measures were assessed repeatedly throughout sessions. Mixed linear models were followed-up with Tukey's HSD t-tests. RESULTS: HR/BP indicated nicotine exposure during nicotine-containing conditions. OB and tobacco/menthol 36 mg/ml conditions produced significant decreases in ratings of cig smoking urges. Nicotine/drug effects were elevated significantly for OB and 36 mg/ml ECIG conditions with one exception noted for the tobacco/menthol 0 mg/ml condition. OB had the highest acceptability ratings, and ECIG condition results varied by acceptability item. CONCLUSIONS: Among young adult smokers, ECIG conditions containing nicotine were positively associated with several subjective measures of abuse liability but not all. Flavors did not consistently mask/enhance effects observed. Results reinforce continued examination of ECIG-delivered nicotine and liquid flavors in relationship to abuse liability.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We used biochemical analysis of urine to quantitatively assess exposure to nicotine and delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in adolescents receiving medical care in a public hospital METHODS: Participants were 686 adolescents between 12 and 21 years old seen at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital between 2012 and 2014. Urine samples were assayed using high sensitivity liquid chromatographic assays for cotinine, a major metabolite of nicotine, and 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta 9-THC (THC-COOH), a major metabolite of THC. A commonly used immunoassay screen for THC-COOH was also performed. RESULTS: The THC-COOH immunoassay substantially underestimated THC exposure, as measured with the high sensitivity assay. THC use was detected in 25% of participants, with higher prevalence with increasing age and in non-Hispanic blacks. Active tobacco smokers had an 80% prevalence of THC use (odds ratio for cigarette smoking predicting THC use 13.2). Urine cotinine and THC-COOH were significantly correlated (r = 0.60). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a high sensitivity chromatographic urine assay provides a much more complete picture of adolescent tobacco use compared to a commonly used immunoassay. The immunoassay provides high specificity but moderate sensitivity. We confirm high concordance of tobacco and marijuana use and the high predictive value of cigarette smoking in predicting marijuana use, and provide novel data on the quantitative correlation between level of exposure to nicotine and THC. Quantitative screening of nicotine and THC exposure may enhance our understanding of addiction and harm from single and dual product use.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This is the first study to examine the validity of self-reported nicotine patch adherence relative to saliva cotinine. METHODS: We used data from 198 clinical trial participants who received 11 weeks of nicotine patches, self-reported patch use, had saliva cotinine 1-week after the start of treatment assessed, and were not smoking when saliva was collected (CO < 6). Self-reported patch adherence was defined as: 3-day (before saliva collection), 7-day (before saliva collection), 3-week use (7 days before, and 14 days after, saliva collection), and 11-week use (7 days before, and 10 weeks after, saliva collection). Analyses, including receiver operating characteristic curves, considered differences in nicotine metabolism. Sensitivity, specificity and positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) assessed optimal cotinine cut-point for adherence. RESULTS: Self-reported 7-day (r = 0.13) and 3-week (r = 0.13) patch use marginally correlated with week 1 cotinine (p's = 0.08) but not 3-day or 11-week. Significant area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.67 (95 %CI: 0.55-0.79) and 0.72 (95 %CI: 0.57-0.88) were found using 7-day self-report for the overall sample and for slow metabolizers (p's<0.01), but not for normal metabolizers. Optimal 1-week cotinine cut-points using 7-day self-report were 170 ng/mL (overall) and 184 ng/mL (slow), with sensitivity = 0.56-0.62, specificity = 0.69-0.78, PPV = 0.96-0.97, and NPV = 0.13-0.14. CONCLUSIONS: Among CO-confirmed abstainers, self-reported patch use and saliva cotinine assessed 1-week into treatment, were modestly correlated and optimal cotinine cut-point differed by rate of nicotine metabolism. Seven-day patch use may be a more valid self-report measure of patch adherence based on cotinine than 3-day, 3-week, or 11-week. Rate of nicotine metabolism may affect this relationship.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Whether specific subjective responses to e-cigarettes are associated with extent of smoking reduction and complete switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes is unclear. This study determined whether initial subjective responses to e-cigarettes related to the successful substitution of e-cigarettes for cigarettes and extent of cigarette and e-cigarette use. METHODS: Adult cigarette smokers (N = 58) uninterested in quitting were asked to completely substitute their cigarettes with an e-cigarette (Vuse Solo) for 8 weeks. At week 1, subjective responses to e-cigarettes were measured using the Product Evaluation Scale and Drug Effects/Liking Survey. A Poisson regression examined whether any of these initial subjective responses were associated with smoke-free days, e-cigarette puffs, and cigarettes smoked between weeks 6 and 8 after adjustment for potential confounders. A logistic regression examined the relationship between subjective measures and exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) verified 7-day abstinence at week 8 after adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Following Holm's p-value adjustment, e-cigarette liking and desire were associated with increased e-cigarette use (adjusted p < 0.01) and decreased cigarette use (adjusted p < 0.05). Measures of psychological reward and drug liking were associated with 7-day abstinence, however this association was no longer significant following p-value adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Initial subjective responses were related to cigarette and e-cigarette use at weeks 6-8, but not smoke-free days or CO-verified 7-day abstinence.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Hypotheses suggested high levels of W1 TD would be associated with persistent tobacco use at Wave 2 (W2). PARTICIPANTS: A U.S. nationally representative sample of 32,320 adult W1 and W2 interviews focused on 11,615 W1 adults who were current established tobacco users and completed the W2 interview. FINDINGS: Higher TD scores and greater changes in TD scores were associated with greater quantity and frequency of tobacco use at the W2 interview for Cigarette Only (n = 7068), Smokeless (smokeless or snus pouches) Only (n = 772), Cigarette plus E-Cigarette (n = 592), and Multiple Products (n = 1866) users, although not significantly so for E-Cigarette Only (n = 367), Cigar Only (traditional, cigarillo, or filtered) (n = 584), or Hookah Only (n = 366) users. Higher TD was associated with decreased odds of successful quitting for Cigarette and Multiple Product users. Higher TD was associated with increased odds of a quit attempt for those in the Hookah and Multiple Products user groups and was not associated with quit attempts or deceased odds of quit success among exclusive E-Cigarette, Cigar, Smokeless and Cigarette plus E-Cigarette users. CONCLUSION: Support for the predictive validity of the PATH Study measures of adult TD will enable regulatory investigations of TD across several tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study aims to document the predictors of the appearance of initial ND symptoms and full ND syndrome among adolescent waterpipe (WP) and cigarette smokers. METHODS: A 6-year longitudinal study was conducted among 8th and 9th graders from 38 schools in Lebanon. The analysis sample included exclusive-WP (n = 228) and exclusive-cigarette smokers (n = 139). Weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to characterizing predictors of initial ND symptoms and full ND syndrome. RESULTS: Predictors of experiencing initial ND symptoms among WP smokers included low maternal educational level, having a sibling who smoked WP, low physical activity, high body mass index (BMI), smoking initiation at a younger age. For cigarette smokers these were being male, younger, having lower BMI, having a sibling who smoked cigarettes, living in a crowded household, and smoking daily. Among WP smokers, predictors of developing full ND syndrome include being younger, believing that WP smokers have more friends, depression, high levels of impulsivity, and initiating smoking at a younger age. For cigarette smokers, predictors of full ND syndrome were being younger and initiating smoking at a younger age. CONCLUSION: Smoking cessation and prevention interventions targeting youth should address modifiable, and tobacco use-specific factors that influence the development of ND among young WP and cigarette smokers. They also need to start at a younger age to target those most vulnerable to developing life-long addiction to tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Self-reported product dependence among individuals using cigarettes only, electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) only, and both cigarettes and ENDS (dual users) was compared. METHOD: PATH Wave 3 data were collected between 2015 and 2016. We used 11 Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives items to assess cigarette and ENDS dependence, averaged to generate Cigarette Dependence (CD) and ENDS Dependence (ED) scores. Linear regression models were used to assess the association between tobacco use groups and the two dependence scores. RESULTS: Our analytic sample included 5538 (91.5 %) cigarette only, 399 (6.7 %) ENDS only, and 108 (1.8 %) dual users. There was no difference in CD between cigarette only and dual users. ENDS only users' ED (2.11, SE = 0.05) was higher than dual users' ED (1.67, SE = 0.04) (p < 0.05). Dual users' mean ED (1.70, SE = 0.09) was significantly lower than their CD (3.03, SE = 0.11) (p < 0.001), and ENDS only users' ED (2.34, SE = 0.05) was significantly lower than cigarette only users' CD (2.94, SE = 0.02) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: While there was no difference in CD between dual and cigarette only users, dual users' ED was lower than that for ENDS only users. ENDS appeared to produce less dependence than cigarettes among dual users. Given the high nicotine concentration ENDS products that entered the market after PATH Wave 3 data were collected, future research should examine ED among ENDS only and dual users.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,No,

This study aimed to identify factors that conjointly influenced NVP relative harm perception among smokers and ex-smokers. METHODS: Data (n = 11,838) from adult smokers and ex-smokers (quit < 2 years) who participated in the 2016 ITC 4 Country Smoking and Vaping Surveys in Australia, Canada, England and the US were analyzed. Decision tree models were used to classify respondents into those who perceived vaping as less harmful than smoking (""correct"" perception) versus otherwise (""incorrect"" perception) based on their socio-demographic, smoking and vaping related variables. RESULTS: Decision tree analysis identified nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) harmfulness perceptions relative to smoking, perceived vaping portrayal in the media and other sources as positive, negative or balanced, recency of seeking online vaping information, and age as the key variables that interacted conjointly to classify respondents into those with ""correct"" versus ""incorrect"" harm perceptions of vaping relative to smoking (model performance accuracy = 0.70-0.74). In all countries, NRT relative harmfulness perception and vaping portrayal perception were consistently the two most important classifying variables, with other variables showing some country differences. CONCLUSIONS: In all four countries, perception of NVP relative harmfulness among smokers and recent ex-smokers is strongly influenced by a combination of NRT relative harmfulness perception and vaping portrayal in the media and other sources. These conjoint factors can serve as useful markers for identifying subgroups more vulnerable to misperception about NVP relative harmfulness to benefit from corrective intervention.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore participants' experiences after 72 hours of exclusively smoking very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes. METHODS: We conducted a residential study during which participants who smoked cigarettes (N = 16) stayed in a smoking-friendly hotel for 5 days/4 nights. Participants only had access to VLNC cigarettes and were told the cigarettes had 97% less nicotine compared to conventional cigarettes. We conducted individual interviews with participants to assess their initial expectations about VLNC cigarettes, subjective experiences when smoking VLNC cigarettes, opinions regarding a low-nicotine product standard, and predicted use behavior if only VLNC cigarettes were available. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis methods. RESULTS: Several participants expected, prior to trying VLNC cigarettes, to compensate for the reduced nicotine levels by smoking more cigarettes but were surprised when they did not increase their smoking. A subset of participants reported experiencing minor withdrawal symptoms, such as irritability and fatigue. Several participants reported feeling less dependent after exclusively smoking VLNC cigarettes. Most participants said they would smoke VLNC cigarettes if they were the only cigarettes available to purchase. Some also said that smoking VLNC cigarettes could help people taper down or quit smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Health communication strategies are needed to inform people who smoke about what to expect from a low-nicotine product standard for cigarettes in order to maximize the public health impact of the policy and increase support.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Plasma Nicotine Metabolite Ratio (NMR) is a robust phenotypic biomarker of CYP2A6 activity and nicotine clearance. In urine, the NMR has been calculated as a ratio of free trans-3'-hydroxycotinine to free cotinine (NMRF/F), total trans-3'-hydroxycotinine to free cotinine (NMRT/F), or total trans-3'-hydroxycotinine to total cotinine (NMRT/T). We evaluated these three urinary NMR versions relative to plasma NMR and nicotine clearance and elucidated mechanisms of discrepancies among them. METHODS: Baseline plasma and urine biomarker data were available from two smoking cessation clinical trials and one nicotine pharmacokinetic study (total N = 768). NMRs were compared using Pearson correlations, linear regressions and ANOVA analyses. UGT2B10 and UGT2B17 were genotyped. RESULTS: Urinary NMRT/F was the most highly related to plasma NMR (R2 = 0.70, P <2.2e-16) followed by NMRF/F (R2 = 0.68, P <2.2e-16), while NMRT/T was less strongly related (R2 = 0.60, P <2.2e-16); consistent across study, ethnicity, sex, heaviness of smoking, and analyte analysis. Controlling for cotinine glucuronidation, as a phenotype or UGT2B10 genotype, corrected the NMRT/T discordance with plasma NMR (Panova<0.001). Similar findings were obtained for relationships of nicotine clearance with plasma NMR > urinary NMRT/F > NMRF/F > NMRT/T (R2 = 0.41 > 0.37 > 0.35 > 0.25 respectively). CONCLUSION: Urinary NMRT/F followed by NMRF/F are the best urinary alternatives to plasma NMR or nicotine clearance. NMRT/T has the least utility as it is influenced substantially by variation in cotinine glucuronidation. IMPACT: This work highlighted the variation in urinary NMRs, and identified mechanisms for disparities among them, which facilitates their use in predicting smoking-related outcomes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: Participants ages 13-20 were recruited online September-November 2020 (N = 900, approximately 30 per city). Cities (median population = 688,531) were in 23 states. Ever e-cigarette users were oversampled. A multilevel generalized estimating equations (GEE) model compared past-month nicotine vaping as a function of local e-cigarette retail policy. Among ever-users, multilevel bivariate GEE models examined associations of participant characteristics with past-month vaping (yes/no) and, among past-month nicotine vapers, purchase of vaping products at a retail location (yes/no). RESULTS: The sample (age M = 17.7 [SD = 1.8]) was 60.2% female and 29.3% Black. Minimal city-level variation was observed in e-cigarette risk perceptions or policy attitudes (ICCs < 0.001). Nearly half the sample (44.6%) reported ever e-cigarette use; 11.8% reported past-month nicotine vaping. Past-month nicotine vaping was associated with older age, being non-Hispanic white, living with someone who vapes, having friends who vape, greater exposure to retail e-cigarette ads, lower e-cigarette risk perceptions, and lower perceived efficacy of flavored tobacco policy. Among ever-users, past-month nicotine vaping was not significantly associated with city e-cigarette flavor policy (p = .784). Most participants reporting past-month nicotine vaping purchased products in-store (58.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Among young people surveyed in US cities, e-cigarette risk perceptions and policy attitudes showed minimal between-city variation. Past-month vaping among ever-users did not differ significantly by local flavor policies. A majority of past-month users, regardless of city policies, reported underage access to flavored products in retail locations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: A nationally representative survey of U.S. youth and young adults in Fall 2019 (n = 9554) assessed knowledge that e-cigarette and cigarette companies are the same, belief that e-cigarette companies lie about harm, and belief that tobacco companies want young people to vape. Weighted multivariate logistic regression models estimated odds of current use and susceptibility to use (among ever and never users) by industry knowledge and beliefs. Additional models assess association between industry knowledge and industry beliefs. All models controlled for harm perceptions, friend use, sensation seeking, combustible use, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Disagreement that companies lie about harm (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)= 1.94, 95% CI: 1.43-2.63) and companies want young people to vape (aOR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.36-2.17) was associated with increased odds of current use. Belief that e-cigarette and cigarette companies were different entities was associated with increased odds of current use (aOR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.12-1.88). Disagreement or not knowing that companies are the same was associated with lower odds of believing companies lie about harm (disagreement aOR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.27-0.52; don't know aOR=0.47, 95% CI: 0.35-0.65) and belief that companies want young people to vape (disagreement aOR=0.36, 95% CI: 0.28-0.46; don't know aOR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.42-0.68). CONCLUSION: Similar to cigarettes, e-cigarette industry beliefs were associated with current use among young people.

Many youth who vape indicate interest in quitting; however, few empirically supported vaping cessation interventions exist. This pilot feasibility study adapted an established behavioral intervention, contingency management (CM), delivered via telehealth to promote vaping cessation among young adults. METHODS: Participants (N = 27; ages 17-21) vaping nicotine regularly were recruited via social media and digital advertisements from across the US (June 2020-January 2021). Participants were randomized at approximately 4:1 to CM or Monitoring control (22:5). CM was delivered through DynamiCare Health's smartphone app for 4 weeks, in which financial incentives were delivered contingent on abstinent cotinine samples after the quit day until the end of treatment (EOT; Days 7-28; 10 expected submissions). Control participants earned incentives for submitting cotinine, regardless of abstinence. Feasibility, acceptability, and abstinence was collected throughout treatment, at EOT, and at 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: The majority of enrolled participants completed treatment (Monitoring: 5/5; CM: 20/22), and intervention components were rated favorably overall (> 80%). CM participants submitted 112/220 (55%) abstinent cotinine samples throughout the quit attempt, while the Monitoring group submitted 4/50 (8%) negative samples. There were no differences in abstinence between groups at EOT or follow-up. CONCLUSION: This pilot study of a telehealth-based youth vaping cessation intervention demonstrated preliminary feasibility and acceptability. These results suggest that CM for young adult vaping cessation, delivered remotely, is a promising direction for future work and fully powered trials are warranted to assess intervention efficacy.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

We investigated the maternal nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR; trans-3'-hydroxycotinine/cotinine) - a genetically-informed biomarker of nicotine clearance - as a moderator of links between prenatal cigarette use and birth weight. We also explored the role of race in these associations. METHODS: Participants were 454 pregnant women (Mage = 25 years; 11% Black) who smoked cigarettes and their 537 infants from the Collaborative Perinatal Project. Cigarettes smoked per day were assessed at each prenatal visit; maternal NMR was assayed from third trimester serum. Birth weight was obtained from medical records. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate associations between cigarette smoking, NMR, race, and birth weight. RESULTS: NMR moderated continuous associations between cigarettes per day over pregnancy and infant birth weight (p = .025). Among women who smoked at moderate levels (<15 cigarettes per day), those with slower NMR showed ~50-100 g decrements in birth weight versus those with faster NMR., while there were no significant associations between NMR and birth weight among women who smoked 15+ cigarettes per day. Although effects of NMR on birthweight were similar for Black and white women, Black women showed significantly slower NMR (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration that the maternal nicotine metabolism phenotype moderates associations between maternal smoking during pregnancy and birth weight. Infants of women with slower nicotine metabolism - including disproportionate representation of Black women - may be at heightened risk for morbidity from maternal smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The Cigarette Ratings Scale is an ideal measure for further evaluation because it has been widely used in tobacco regulatory science and tobacco industry research. PURPOSE: This study investigated the construct validity of the Cigarette Ratings Scale and associations with tobacco use and product feature outcomes. METHODS: Using secondary analysis of baseline data from five research trials, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis in one sample and validated the factor solution in a second sample. We then examined the relationship of the averaged subscales with tobacco outcomes and cigarette product features among current adult cigarette smokers (N = 752) who smoked ≥ 5 cigarettes daily for ≥ 5 years. RESULTS: The results supported a three-factor solution: 1. Product harshness evaluation, 2. Smoking satisfaction, and 3. Positive sensory experience. Multivariable general linear models indicated that cigarettes per day was associated with a lower harshness rating b = -0.29 (95% CI: -0.51, -0.07) and higher positive sensory experience b = 0.32 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.56). FTND average dependence scores were associated with a more positive sensory experience b = 1.08 (95% CI: 0.28, 1.89). CO boost was associated with smoking satisfaction b = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.30, 1.26). CONCLUSIONS: The Cigarette Ratings Scale subscales were primarily associated with behavioral outcomes, biological exposure, and nicotine dependence.

Our study examined whether change in risk perception of ECs predicts cigarettes smoked per week (CPW) among Black and Latinx individuals who smoke enrolled in an EC switching randomized clinical trial (RCT). METHODS: We analyzed data from one arm of a 6-week EC RCT of individuals who smoke attempting to switch to nicotine salt pod system ECs (n = 110; Black, n = 57; Latinx, n = 53). Our explanatory variable was change in risk perception of ECs compared to combustible cigarettes (CC) from baseline to week 6. Our outcome was CPW measured by a 7-day timeline follow-back interview. A negative binomial GEE model was conducted to examine the association between risk perception and CPW at baseline and week 6. RESULTS: The mean CPW decreased from 82.8 (SD=49.8) at baseline to 15.8 (SD=29.8) at week 6. A one-level increase in EC risk perception (i.e., EC perceived as riskier than CC from baseline to week 6) was associated with an increase in CPW (IRR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.03; 3.24). Latinx participants were more likely to have higher CPW as EC risk perception increased compared to Black participants (IRR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.09; 3.26). CONCLUSION: We found that CPW at week 6 was significantly higher as change in risk perception of EC relative to CC increased. Given the influence of risk perception on smoking behavior, people who smoke should be educated on the benefits and harms of ECs.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We use the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace to estimate the impact of banning menthol cigarettes (Experiment 1) and decreasing allowable cigarette filter ventilation levels (Experiment 2). METHODS: Crowdsourced participants were randomized into one of four groups (2×2 factorial design). Experiment 1 included menthol availability (yes/no) by purchasing option (legal only vs illegal available). Experiment 2 included filter-vented cigarettes availability (yes/no) by purchasing option (legal only vs illegal available). Participants were given an individualized budget to purchase tobacco. Percent budget spent was the outcome measure. RESULTS: Experiment 1, with a legal marketplace only, non-menthol cigarette purchasing was lower (p=0.010) and electronic-cigarette purchasing was higher (p=0.016), when cigarettes were banned compared to when they were available. With an illegal marketplace, switching to legal non-menthol cigarettes was less likely (p<0.001) and purchasing illegal menthol cigarettes was higher (p<0.001), when cigarettes were banned compared to when they were available. Experiment 2, with a legal marketplace only, cigarette purchasing was lower (p=0.010), when the participant's filtered vented cigarettes were banned compared to when they were available. With an illegal marketplace, purchasing the legal low-ventilated cigarette option was lower (p<0.001) and significant differences in illegal filter-vented cigarette purchasing were not observed, when their filter-vented cigarettes were banned compared to when they were available legally. CONCLUSIONS: Without an illegal option, both restrictions decreased cigarette purchasing, but the menthol ban increased e-cigarette purchasing. With an illegal option, a menthol ban increased illegal cigarette purchasing, but decreasing filter ventilation did not.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The nicotine dose for each puff also is directly proportional to nicotine flux (i.e., dose/puff=nicotine flux*puff duration). This study examines the effect of nicotine form and flux on puffing parameters and mouth-level nicotine exposure. METHODS: Thirty-two dual ENDS and combustible cigarette participants completed five visits that differed by nicotine form (freebase or protonated) and nicotine flux (14 or 35µg/sec); a zero-nicotine condition was a negative control. Participants used a Subox Mini C ENDS, powered at 20W, during a 10-puff directed bout (B1) followed by a one-hour ad libitum bout (B2). Puffing parameters and mouth-level nicotine exposure were assessed using the American University of Beirut REALTIME instrument. RESULTS: Relative to protonated nicotine, freebase nicotine was associated with lower total puff duration (puff duration*number of puffs), lower flow rate in B1, lower liquid consumption, and lower mouth-level nicotine exposure. Increasing nicotine flux from 14 to 35µg/sec was associated with lower total puff duration in both bouts, as well as lower liquid consumption. Increasing nicotine flux was associated with higher mouth-level nicotine exposure in B1 only. CONCLUSION: ENDS with protonated nicotine may enhance nicotine exposure by promoting longer puffing and thus greater dose delivered. This work highlights the importance of accounting for interactions between nicotine form and flux when considering nicotine regulation for ENDS.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Menthol can be added to cigarettes at perceptible levels (so-called flavored cigarettes or characterized flavored cigarettes) or non-perceptible levels (subliminal). Our objective was to understand the reasons that tobacco companies use subliminal menthol. METHODS: We identified previously secret internal tobacco company documents dated 1955-2012 in the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents archive on menthol at subliminal levels. RESULTS: Beginning in at least the 1950s, tobacco companies used subliminal menthol to compensate the flavor loss caused by filters, reduce smoke harshness, reduce dryness, and increase smoke coolness. Varying menthol concentrations were considered to help convert people who smoke non-menthol to menthol brands, possibly because people who use menthol cigarettes have more harship quitting than people who use non-menthol cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: Menthol is an important additive beyond its function as a ""characterizing flavor."" Tobacco companies use menthol in ""non-menthol"" cigarettes at subliminal (non-perceptible by the people who smoke cigarettes) levels to improve taste, make them easier to smoke and facilitate initiation, and possibly convert people who smoke non-menthol cigarettes to menthol cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Additional tobacco control policies and health insurance coverage for tobacco treatment were included as part of the Act. Implementation of these policies occurred between November 2019 and June 2020. This study explored challenges and facilitators during the implementation of the Act experienced by public health officials, school personnel, and healthcare providers. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of 9 public health officials and advocates, 9 school personnel, and 8 healthcare providers from March to December 2021. We conducted thematic analysis of interview transcripts using inductive codes of key themes emerging from the interviews. RESULTS: Interviewees highlighted three key themes that impacted the implementation of the Act: 1) Education of those impacted by the Act, 2) Organizational-level changes to incorporate the Act, and 3) Enforcement challenges. Examples of challenges to the implementation of the Act included COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, navigating tobacco industry tactics around naming flavors, and confusion regarding health insurance coverage for tobacco use cessation programs. Examples of facilitators were enforcement leading to retailer compliance, committed advocacy efforts of leadership/champions, and strong coordination within and between organizations.

The top two that led to seeking medical advice were: mouth irritation (46.8 %) and loss of taste (45.2 %). Those more likely to self-report side effects were younger, male, currently smoking (vs quit), vaping for <6 months (vs >1 year), using disposables or cartridges/pods (vs tanks), using vapes with nicotine (vs without nicotine), using menthol/mint flavour (vs sweet flavour), currently smoking (vs quit), believing vaping causes various diseases (e.g., heart disease), and believing that vaping is equally/more harmful than smoking. CONCLUSION: Negative side effects associated with NVP use were rare and mainly minor in all four countries. Shorter duration of vaping, concurrent smoking while vaping and perceptions of greater vaping harms relative to smoking were associated with more reported negative side effects attributed to vaping.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: Eight (7M, 1F) healthy adults who use both cannabis and tobacco participated in a 3-arm, within-subject study. Participants were administered 3 standardized puffs of cannabis only, tobacco only, or a 50-50 mixture with a PAX-3. Blood was collected and questionnaires were administered before and after the last puff. RESULTS: Average maximum plasma THC concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma THC concentration-time curve (AUC) were significantly higher after vaping the mixture compared to cannabis only [Cmax: 25.7 ± 14.0ng/mL vs. 9.7 ± 6.5ng/mL, p < 0.04 (mean±SD); AUC: 590 ± 555ng/mL•min vs. 306 ± 258ng/mL•min, p < 0.02]. Similarly, plasma nicotine Cmax and AUC(0→360) were significantly higher after vaping the mixture compared to tobacco only [Cmax: 1.6 ± 0.71ng/mL vs. 0.55 ± 0.32ng/mL, p < 0.02; AUC: 135 ± 35.7ng/mL•min vs. 63.1 ± 25.4ng/mL•min, p < 0.01]. Although elevated from use of the mixture, heart rate changes were not significantly different across study conditions. Subjective effects generally did not differ across study conditions, but this may have been due to the small sample size of the study. CONCLUSION: Vaping cannabis and tobacco together leads to greater exposure to THC and nicotine than the substances by themselves. Despite differences in THC exposure, subjective effects and heart rate were not different between the mixture and cannabis only, indicating potential attenuation of THC-related effects by nicotine.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We explore methodological issues when interpreting a narrowly-focused association (typically using a causal-inference framework) vs. a wider approach incorporating many correlated risk factors (using a less-common predictive-inference framework), using the currently-relevant example of adolescent e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking. METHODS: Data were drawn from the Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences (ABES) study, national survey of U.S. youth, and behavioral risks were grouped into categories of e-cigarette use, cigarette smoking, other tobacco use, alcohol and cannabis use, illicit drug use, mental health, violence, other risky behaviors, and parental monitoring. Three exploratory data analyses (Spearman correlation, non-metric multidimensional scaling, and divisive hierarchical clustering) examined clustering/grouping across variables. Logistic regressions examined 1) the association between e-cigarette use and smoking and 2) the reverse-direction association, after successively adjusting for groups of risk factors. Ten-fold cross-validation was performed to evaluate predictive validity. RESULTS: In three exploratory data analyses, e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking were correlated, but each was more closely related to other variables (alcohol and cannabis use vs. other tobacco use and illicit drugs, respectively). Logistic regression models showed similar odds ratios for the forward- and reverse-direction models, but cross-validation testing showed that the reverse-direction model had better classification performance. CONCLUSIONS: A narrow focus on adolescent risk behaviors with a causal-inference framework can result in erroneous interpretation in the presence of many correlated risk factors. A wider predictive-inference perspective can help inform better screening strategies and potential intervention targets.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This can reduce use of banned products and induce substitution towards non-banned products. The net impact must be determined empirically. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impacts of these bans on both use and substitution. SETTING: US tobacco market. PARTICIPANTS: 3220 individuals aged 18-41 in the United States who smoked and/or vaped (past 30-day use) completed an online survey. MEASUREMENTS: Multinomial logistic models regressed changes in tobacco product use between two time periods on: states with and without bans on flavored e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes, individuals' characteristics, and other state-level tobacco policies. Estimated models were used to simulate impacts of flavor bans for people who dual use. RESULTS: Policies' impacts were only observed for those who dual use cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Most who dual use did not change their tobacco product use regardless of state policy. Some significant differences were found by states for those who quit both products. Massachusetts, with bans on both flavored e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes, had the greatest predicted rate of quitting both products (9 %) compared to states without (3 %). States with e-cigarette flavors bans had higher cessation of e-cigarette use among those who dual use. CONCLUSIONS: Flavor bans on cigarettes and e-cigarettes were associated with reduced vaping among those who dual use. Massachusetts saw a higher proportion of quitting all tobacco products, likely because people who smoked in Massachusetts could not substitute with flavored e-cigarettes which had been banned.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This model has been invoked frequently to explain the phenomenon of ""compensation,"" in which people increase puffing intensity when using reduced-nicotine products. However, puffing patterns may also be governed by sensory feedback in the upper airways. This study tests that hypothesis using electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) as a model. DESIGN: Within-subject, double-blind clinical study using a puff-by-puff switching protocol. SETTING: Clinical Aerosol Technology Lab, American University of Beirut; December 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Ten adults who consume both ENDS and cigarettes completed three randomized directed puffing bouts during a single clinical lab visit. In each bout, they alternated puffs between two identical ENDS devices differing by one design factor: (1) power (20W vs 40W, 0mg/ml nicotine); (2) power (20W vs 40W, matched nicotine flux); (3) PG:VG ratio (30:70 vs 70:30). OUTCOMES: Puff topography and sensory feedback (mouthful, draw effort, throat hit) measured on a puff-by-puff basis. RESULTS: Puff duration responded immediately and reversibly to changes in sensory feedback. At higher power, participants reported stronger mouthful, easier draw, and took shorter puffs regardless of nicotine content (p < .05). At matched flux, computed nicotine dose was lower at 40W than 20W (p < .01). PG:VG effects were also significant. CONCLUSIONS: Puffing behavior appears to be driven by sensory cues, not delayed nicotine effects-highlighting an underused regulatory pathway: targeting product design features that shape perception.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

An intensifying pandemic of disease caused or exacerbated by smoking demands more effective policy responses than the current one: demanding that nicotine users abstain. A pragmatic response to the smoking problem is blocked by moralistic campaigns masquerading as public health, by divisions within the community of opponents to present policy, and by the public-health professions antipathy to any tobacco-control endeavours other than smoking cessation. Yet, numerous alternative systems for nicotine delivery exist, many of them far safer than smoking. A pragmatic, public-health approach to tobacco control would recognize a continuum of risk and encourage nicotine users to move themselves down the risk spectrum by choosing safer alternatives to smoking--without demanding abstinence.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The most promising harm reduction products are high dose pharmaceutical nicotine preparations and low nitrosamine smokeless tobacco, such as Swedish snus. However, despite widespread availability, existing pharmaceutical nicotine preparations have not been taken up by smokers as an alternative to smoking. In Sweden, increased snus use was associated with decreased cigarette smoking and mortality from tobacco-related disease. We suggest a graduated series of policies to explore of the public health costs and benefits of encouraging smokers to switch to these less harmful nicotine products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

The article argues that NRT puts into action a medicalised logic of substitution in which dependence on nicotine becomes a route to health as well as a disorder to be treated. NRT thereby enables different performances of the substance nicotine, the identity smoker and the practice of quitting. The article draws on a range of smoking cessation and tobacco control literature, including medical and public health research, government-sponsored stop smoking websites and clinical guidelines to trace the changes produced by the shifting status of most forms of NRT from prescription medication to consumer health product. It also examines less conventional uses of NRT which produce varied practices of quitting and thus support the possibility of tobacco harm reduction based on the circulation of 'good nicotine'.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Tobacco harm reduction alternatives espouse substituting cigarettes with safer nicotine and tobacco products. Policy shifts embracing tobacco harm reduction have increased media attention, yet it remains controversial. Discourse theory posits language as fluid, and socially constructed meaning as neither absolute nor neutral, elevating certain views over others while depicting ""discursive struggle"" between them. While an abstinence-based framework dominates tobacco policy, discourse theory suggests constructions of nicotine and tobacco use can change, for example by positioning tobacco harm reduction more favorably. METHODS: Textual discourse analysis was used to explore constructions of tobacco harm reduction in 478 (308 original) U.S. textual news media articles spanning 1996-2014. Using keyword database sampling, retrieved articles were analyzed first as discrete recording units and then to identify emergent thematic content. RESULTS: Constructions of tobacco harm reduction shifted over this time, revealing tension among industry and policy interests through competing definitions of tobacco harm reduction, depictions of its underlying science, and accounts of regulatory matters including tobacco industry support for harm reduction and desired marketing and taxation legislation. CONCLUSIONS: Heightened salience surrounding tobacco harm reduction and electronic cigarettes suggests their greater acceptance in U.S. tobacco control. Various media depictions construct harm reduction as a temporary means to cessation, and conflict with other constructions of it that place no subjective value on continued ""safer"" tobacco/nicotine use. Constructions of science largely obscure claims of the veracity of tobacco harm reduction, with conflict surrounding appropriate public health benchmarks for tobacco policy and health risks of nicotine use. Taxation policies and e-cigarette pricing relative to cigarettes are key for wider adoption, while concerns are raised for whether their availability will increase initiation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The legal duty of their managers to maximise shareholder wealth means that such companies vigorously fight any new public health measures that have the potential to disrupt their massive profit making, and have the resources to do so. Protecting the public health is therefore made a lot more difficult and expensive. We suggest that one way to counter this would be to actively design future tobacco control policies so that tobacco companies face mechanisms and incentives to develop in such a way that they no longer achieve the greatest shareholder value by focusing on cigarettes. A proper tobacco diversification and exit strategy for the shareholders of the profit-seeking tobacco industry would protect the public health by addressing the current addiction to the continuation of the cigarette market. The increasing popularity of e-cigarettes presents a particular opportunity in this regard, and we therefore suggest a possible policy response in order to start discussion in this area.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Our aim is to assess the research status on e-cigarettes' contribution to 'renormalization' of smoking and to clarify how renormalization of smoking can be appraised at the conceptual and empirical level. Combining conceptual analysis and narrative review, the paper brings out three dimensions of denormalization/renormalization of smoking ('unacceptability/acceptability'; 'invisibility/visibility'; 'phasing out behaviour/maintaining behaviour') and an inherent duality of the e-cigarette as a smoking-like device and a smoking alternative. These analytical dimensions are applied qualitatively to consider the literature identified by searching the Web of Science database for 'e-cigarettes AND renormalization' (and variants thereof). Theoretically, normative changes in smoking acceptability, increased visibility of e-cigarettes and use, and observations of actual use (prevalence, dual use, gateway) can all be applied to illustrate processes of renormalization. However, only acceptability measures and user measures can be said to be empirical tests of renormalization effects. Visibility measures are only based on logical assumptions of a possible renormalization; they are not in themselves indicative of any ""real"" renormalization effects and can just as well be understood as possible consequences of normalization of e-cigarettes. Just as a downward trend in smoking prevalence is the litmus test of whether denormalization policy works, stagnating or rising smoking prevalence should be the main empirical indicator of renormalization.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Regulation and education campaigns aim to protect children from initiating use, yet it is likely that children will be primarily influenced by the behaviour of people in their immediate environment. This is the first known study exploring e-cigarette users' views and reported experiences of vaping around children. METHODS: Following informed consent, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 40 adults who had attempted to give up smoking by vaping. Participants were recruited from England as part of a wider study into e-cigarette use trajectories and smoking relapse (ECtra study). Data were extracted from 28 interviews where participants had spontaneously discussed vaping around children. Extracted data were analysed thematically and situated in previous analysis of vaping identity which distinguished between recreational and medicinal vapers. RESULTS: Vaping behaviour around children was in part a habituated replication of smoking norms but also guided by broad vaping identity; recreational users were more permissive and medicinal users more secretive. Vaping in the home appeared to be determined by caregivers' need to reconcile vaping behaviour so that it was congruent with parental identity as a responsible caregiver. Participant perspectives reflected existing moral discourses applied to e-cigarettes around the use of ""harm reduction for smokers"" and ""potential for youth harm"". CONCLUSION: Vaping is likely to be role modelled within the community and home despite attempts by e-cigarette users to conceal the behaviour. The ambivalent contextualisation of e-cigarettes means that e-cigarette users may lack a clear narrative to draw on when discussing vaping with children. Public health guidance for vaping around children could be helpful, but to be most effective, should take into consideration users' vaping identity.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, most vaping by never-smokers is occasional and transient and frequent vaping by never-smokers is rare. Vaping is not risk-free but there is limited evidence of significant harm so far to young people who vape. There is weak evidence that vaping is a gateway to smoking. In fact, the evidence suggests that vaping is diverting young people away from smoking overall and is displacing smoking at a population level. The risk of nicotine dependence is very low in never-smokers who vape. Vaping is likely to be beneficial to young smokers who switch to vaping. Policy measures to reduce vaping are discussed. A tightly regulated, risk-proportionate consumer model is recommended to restrict vaping by young people while allowing easy access for adult smokers, for whom it is an effective and popular quitting aid.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Using data from the US arm of the 2016-2020 International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey (ITC 4CV), we employed a multinomial logit model with two-way fixed effects to simultaneously estimate the impacts of cigarette/EC taxes on the change in smoking and vaping frequencies. RESULTS: Our benchmark model suggests that a 10 % increase in cigarette taxes led to an 11 % reduction in smoking frequencies (p < 0.01), while EC taxes did not have a significant effect on smoking frequencies. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that increasing cigarette taxes may serve as an effective means of encouraging people who smoke to cut back on smoking or quit smoking. The impact of increasing EC taxes on smoking transitions is less certain at this time.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

This study aimed to understand levels of support for the various policies among vapers aged ≥16 and differences across relevant subgroups. METHODS: Online cross-sectional survey of 548 vapers (mean [SD] age=24.0 [13.5]; range=16-75) recruited via social media in June/July 2024. Participants were asked the extent to which they supported eight potential vaping policies. They could also provide detailed comments in an open-response box. We estimated the level of support for each policy and used logistic regression to examine independent associations with age, gender, financial situation, and smoking status. Open responses were thematically analysed. RESULTS: Banning child-friendly imagery from packaging had the highest support (80.8 % [95 % CI=77.5-84.1 %]), followed by regulating point-of-sale displays in stores (44.2 % [40.0-48.3 %]), limiting flavour descriptors (41.6 % [37.5-45.7 %]), and banning images, colours, and branding from packaging and devices (41.4 % [37.3-45.6 %]). Support was much lower for banning the sale of disposable vapes (19.9 % [16.5-23.2 %]), limiting flavours to tobacco, mint, and menthol (17.0 % [13.8-20.1 %]), introducing a minimum price (15.7 %[12.7-18.8]), or increasing prices via taxation (10.6 % [8.0-13.2 %]). Support for many of these policies was lower among ex-smokers and those in less advantaged financial situations. While some vapers thought certain policies (e.g., banning disposables/restricting flavours) may be effective in reducing appeal of e-cigarettes to young people, others argued they were unlikely to make a difference to youth vaping and may cause some adult vapers to relapse to smoking or turn to the illicit vape market to access products. CONCLUSIONS: Policies that target the packaging, appearance, and marketing of e-cigarettes appear much more popular among vapers than those targeting price or the types of devices and flavours that can be sold. Vapers emphasised the need to balance policy interventions that make e-cigarettes less appealing to young people but do not deter people from using them as an alternative to smoking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Additionally, taxes on tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes (ECs) may influence consumers' perceptions of the relative costs of these products. Understanding the relationship between cigarette and EC taxes, cost perceptions, and smoking abstinence is therefore crucial. METHODS: This study utilized longitudinal data from the US arm of the 2016-2020 International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping (ITC 4CV) Surveys and implemented a survival analysis to explore the impact of cigarette and EC taxes on smoking abstinence. A mediation analysis was also performed to test whether the effects of taxes are influenced by individuals' perceptions about the relative cost differences between ECs and cigarettes. RESULTS: A 10 % increase in cigarette taxes was associated with an 11.1 % increase in smoking abstinence. EC taxes were not associated with smoking abstinence among the overall sample. However, higher EC taxes were associated with greater odds of smoking abstinence among individuals over 40 and lower odds of smoking abstinence among individuals under 40. Relative cost perception did not mediate the effect of taxes on smoking abstinence. Additionally, the odds of quitting were higher among individuals in the high-income group and those who used ECs daily, and lower among individuals in older age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette taxes have a direct impact on smoking abstinence, independent of cost perceptions. To enhance cessation rates, policymakers should implement targeted strategies such as increasing access to cessation programs, providing financial incentives for quitting, and tailoring tax policies to better support older individuals and those with lower incomes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

While most patients with EVALI report vaping tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) oils contaminated with vitamin E acetate, a subset report only vaping with nicotine-containing electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). Whether or not e-cigs cause EVALI, the outbreak highlights the need for identifying long term health effects of e-cigs. EVALI pathology includes alveolar damage, pneumonitis and/or organizing pneumonia, often with lipid-laden macrophages (LLM). We assessed LLM in the lungs of healthy smokers, e-cig users, and never-smokers as a potential marker of e-cig toxicity and EVALI. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using bronchoscopy was conducted in healthy smokers, e-cig users, and never-smokers (n = 64). LLM, inflammatory cell counts, and cytokines were determined in bronchial alveolar fluids (BAL). E-cig users included both never-smokers and former light smokers. FINDINGS: High LLM was found in the lungs of almost all smokers and half of the e-cig users, but not those of never-smokers. LLM were not related to THC exposure or smoking history. LLM were significantly associated with inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in e-cig users, but not smoking-related cytokines. INTERPRETATION: This is the first report of lung LLM comparing apparently healthy smokers, e-cig users, and never-smokers. LLM are not a specific marker for EVALI given the frequent positivity in smokers; whether LLMs are a marker of lung inflammation in some e-cig users requires further study.

FINDINGS: Between November 2018, and February 2020, 114 participants (61 in the varenicline group and 53 in the placebo group) completed the intervention phase at week 12 and 88 participants (52 in the varenicline group and 36 in the placebo group) completed the follow-up phase at week 24. CARs were significantly higher for the varenicline vs placebo at each time-point: 50.0% vs 16.9% (OR = 4.9; 95% CI, 2.3-10.4; P < 0.0001) between weeks 4 and 12; and 48.7% vs 14.3% (OR = 5.7; 95% CI, 2.6-12.3; P < 0.0001) between weeks 4 and 24. The 7-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence was also higher for the varenicline than placebo at each time point. Adverse events were rated as mild or moderate and rarely led to treatment discontinuation. INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that inclusion of varenicline in a cessation programme for adults who smoke and use e-cigarettes with an intention to quit smoking could result in smoking abstinence without serious adverse events. In the absence of evidence from other smoking cessation methods, it could be useful to suggest the use of varenicline in cessation programmes specifically designed to help dual users stop smoking. Further research in larger and more generalisable populations is required to strengthen such a suggestion.

Nicotine stress has an allelopathic inhibitory effect on seeds and a hormesis effect on germinated seeds and seedlings, which has an enhancement effect (<50 mg kg-1) and an inhibition effect (>100 mg kg-1) on the germinated seeds and an enhancement effect (<100 mg kg-1) and an inhibition effect (>200 mg kg-1) on the seedlings. Exogenous nicotine can be absorbed by broad bean roots from nicotine-contaminated soil and accumulated in the main organs of the seedlings, especially the leaves, which exceeded the maximum residue level (0.03 mg kg-1 DW) at 50 mg kg-1. Moreover, nicotine resulted in a bitter taste in the edible broad bean leaves, disrupting the balance of basic nutritional properties, decreasing sucrose, and increasing bitter substances such as choline and procyanidin. These results demonstrated that residual nicotine in the soil not only poses potential risks to sustainable agricultural development but also a food safety risk for consumers.

In this study, we have established a fast and reliable method to achieve specific detection of Nic in natural nicotiana tabacum within 30 s through a miniaturized platform based on screen printed gold electrode (SPE). A simple electrochemical pretreatment mean was employed on gold surface that led to the exposure of Au (111) facet and a convenient sample pretreatment method was adopted to realize the extraction of Nic in tobacco. The present electrochemical sensor exhibits an ample range of sensing from 10 μg/g to 200 μg/g, which is able to compliance with tobacco industry testing standards of actual samples. Over 60 sampling points from different origins in China or other countries were performed with direct analysis using this method and satisfactory results have been obtained. The proposed approach was demonstrated to be a very promising platform for significantly improving analytical efficiency in laboratories as well as for monitoring the source reduction control of Nic in the environment.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Detailed evaluation of the complex factors pertaining to the exposure of smokers to mainstream cigarette smoke was attempted by analysis of discarded cigarette butts. A total of 5475 samples of discarded cigarette butts was collected to investigate the exposure characteristics in relation to Korean smokers. The basic physico-chemical characteristics of cigarettes, including the filter length, filter type, menthol addition, and nicotine and tar content, were determined and the manufacturer and cigarette size were identified. The tobacco-burned percentage (TBP)) and tar staining were used as physical markers, and actual human exposure to cigarette smoke was determined using the part filter method. Multiple linear regression analyses and generalized ordinal logistic regression analysis were conducted to identify the relationship between the socio-demographic factors and the physico-chemical characteristics of the cigarettes themselves and the exposure characteristics. Significant associations were observed between the TBP and age group, occupational group, manufacturer, tar staining, ISO tar content, and filter length. Increased odds of smoking with a heavier tar stain among Korean smokers were associated with blue collar workers vs. other workers, manufacturer B vs. other manufacturers, recess filter vs. other filter types, ISO tar content, and TBP. Finally, significant associations between the log-transformed human-smoked tar and nicotine yields and occupational group, the TBP, tar staining, and physico-chemical properties of cigarettes were found and were used to propose models for predicting the actual exposure to tar and nicotine. The proposed models account for 60-61% and 47-49% of the variance of human exposure to tar and nicotine, respectively. This analysis of discarded cigarette butts revealed that various factors, including socio-demographic factors such as age group and occupational group, as well as the physico-chemical properties of cigarette products such as the filter type and length, cigarette size, ISO tar and nicotine content, and mentholation, affect the characteristics of exposure of Korean smokers to mainstream cigarette smoke.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, neither objective scientific reports, nor the contents of a large number of internal tobacco company documents support this contention. The present review focuses on the hypothesis that addition of ammonium compounds to tobacco enhances global tobacco use due to smoke alkalization and enhanced free-nicotine nicotine exposure. Obviously, ammonia enhances the alkalinity of tobacco smoke. Consequently, the equilibrium shifts from non-volatile nicotine salts to the volatile free base that is more readily absorbed from the airways. The observed change in the kinetics of nicotine (i.e., shorter t(1/2) and higher c(max)) after ammoniation is, however, predominantly due to the higher concentration of nicotine in the smoke, rather than to an increase in the absorption rate of free-base nicotine in the respiratory tract. Although several findings support the hypothesis, additional studies are required and suggested to provide a proper, objective and independent scientific judgment about the effect of tobacco ammoniation on nicotine bioavailability. Scientific and public awareness of the effects of tobacco-specific ammonia compounds may stimulate global control, legislation and restriction of their use in cigarette manufacture.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

This review describes the fate of sugars during tobacco smoking, in particular the effect of tobacco sugars on mainstream smoke composition. In natural tobacco, sugars can be present in levels up to 20 wt%. In addition, various sugars are added in tobacco manufacturing in amounts up to 4 wt% per sugar. The added sugars are usually reported to serve as flavour/casing and humectant. However, sugars also promote tobacco smoking, because they generate acids that neutralize the harsh taste and throat impact of tobacco smoke. Moreover, the sweet taste and the agreeable smell of caramelized sugar flavors are appreciated in particular by starting adolescent smokers. Finally, sugars generate acetaldehyde, which has addictive properties and acts synergistically with nicotine in rodents. Apart from these consumption-enhancing pyrolysis products, many toxic (including carcinogenic) smoke compounds are generated from sugars. In particular, sugars increase the level of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, acrolein, and 2-furfural in tobacco smoke. It is concluded that sugars in tobacco significantly contribute to the adverse health effects of tobacco smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

In the last 25 years cigarette manufacturers have introduced a variety of filter designs to reduce toxic and carcinogenic substances in tobacco smoke (normal filters, NF). However, large quantities of harmful constituents are inefficiently retained by commonly used cigarette filters. Following a patented method we modified commercial cigarette filters (modified filter, MF) by injecting a DNA solution into the filter tips; we then evaluated the reduced polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) levels in mainstream tobacco smoke of MF relative to NF. The PAH measured were: fluoranthene (FLUO), pyrene (PY), benzo(a)anthracene (B(a)A), chrysene (CRY), benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), benzo(b)fluoranthene (B(b)F), benzo(k)fluoranthene (B(k)F), benzo(g,h,i)perylene (BGP), dibenzo(a,h)anthracene (DBA). The levels of PAH in cigarette smoke after MF were significantly reduced (P<0.001) compared to NF, using a variety of cigarette brands in a smoking machine (44.5%+/-8.4 % and 41.8%+/-5% for total and carcinogenic PAH, respectively, means+/-SE). Using B(a)P(TEF) values the reduction in PAH concentrations were similar for all cigarette brands with the exception of Camel, where the reduction was lower considering B(a)P(TEF) values. Amongst carcinogenic PAH, B(a)A, B(b)F and B(k)F) were reduced by 50-58%, CRY, B(a)P and DBA by about 40%. In conclusion MF filters treated with DNA have the potential of decreasing the exposure to PAH in cigarette smoke. Since, unlike some previously proposed biological filters MF do not retain additional nicotine, the main addictive compound of tobacco smoke, these filters may not induce increased smoking to compensate for the reduction in the nicotine delivery to smokers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Two nitrosamines, N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK), present in SLT, listed as group 1 human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, are found to be the prime agents for most of cancers in SLT users. This review illustrates the mechanism of cancer induction by NNN and NNK in humans along with factors influencing the formation of NNN and NNK at various stages of tobacco manufacturing. It reveals the high levels and wide variations of NNN and NNK found among the diverse variety of SLT products sold worldwide. According to a recent report by FDA- Centre for Tobacco Products, reducing levels of nitrosamines in SLT products could greatly enhance the quality of life by reducing mortality, morbidity and medical expenditures due to cancer. For the first time, grass root approaches to minimize the levels of NNN and NNK in tobacco, from plant growth to the finished products, have been systematically compiled as they have the potential to contribute to reducing tobacco related disease burden.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

To compare toxicity levels with that of cigarette smoke (CS) under low toxic concentrations, higher exposure of aerosol collected mass (ACM) from indirectly HTP is required. Conventional ACM extraction with organic solvents, like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) induces solvent toxicity, complicating higher exposure. This study applies a solvent-free squeezing extraction method, to obtain concentrated ACM from indirectly HTPs (IT 3.0a). The solvent-free extract yielded approximately 10 times higher concentration than the DMSO extract, with similar extraction efficiency of main constituents. Ames test results indicated no mutagenicity up to 5000 μg/plate for both extracts. Similarly, micronucleus and neutral red uptake tests showed no additional genotoxicity or cytotoxicity at 5000 μg/mL. By contrast, the DMSO extract from reference CS exhibited significant toxicity at low concentrations. These findings confirm that the non-toxic dose for indirectly HTPs is approximately twice as high as previously reported, with a larger margin than observed in CS toxicity.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,Yes,['Japan Tobacco'],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

To encourage social debate, working groups have been created to put pressure on the film industry through the use of commercials in mainstream media in the hope of making Hollywood accept its responsibility and change its attitude. Smoke Free Movies, an initiative led by the University of California, is making substantial progress toward limiting the appearance of cigarettes in American movies. In Europe, and particularly in Spain, these kinds of initiatives are still fairly new. The Prevention of Nicotine Addiction Movement in Spain should learn from the United States in order to promote similar policies. Some of the proven measures include the following: certification in credits stating no payment was received for the appearance of tobacco in the film, projection of anti-tobacco advertisements before any film that contains scenes with smoking, no brand identification and no subsidies for films that encourage smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The company claims that its intention is for its brand's traditional cigarette smokers to replace these with IQOS has rarely been independently tested. METHOD: Using time series data from September 2016 to June 2020, we analyze whether Heets sales have been accompanied by an improvement in the position of Philip Morris International in the market or if they have merely replaced lost sales of the rest of the brands sold by that tobacco company. RESULTS: Sales of traditional cigarettes of all the brands marketed by PMI have been replaced by IQOS since the introduction of this heated tobacco product in Spain. Almost all of the variations observed in IQOS sales are due to the positioning of this product as a substitute for the range of traditional cigarettes marketed by Philip Morris International. CONCLUSIONS: As there is still no consensus that HTPs are explicitly less harmful to health, health authorities must control messages suggesting improved health outcomes thanks to HTP usage when compared to traditional cigarettes. Such messages could generate a false sense of security and lead to an increase in the consumption of tobacco.

We identified too few studies that examined price differences for cigarillos, chewing tobacco, roll-your-own, and ENDS to reach any conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are in keeping with tobacco industry documents that detailed how manufacturers used race, class, and geography to target vulnerable populations and suggest that regulations that can limit industry price manipulation such as minimum, maximum, and uniform prices, and high specific excise taxes should be considered. More frequent and systematic monitoring of tobacco prices and ENDS is warranted.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

As a fertilizer synergist, polyaspartic acid (PASP) can improve the K content in tobacco leaves, but it is unknown how it affects the K content in different parts of tobacco leaves, and how PASP affects the ratio of total sugar to nicotine in tobacco leaves has not been reported. Therefore, ""Zhongyan 100"" was selected for pot experiments with 5 different PASP addition levels: CK (0.0 %), P1 (0.1 %), P2 (0.2 %), P3 (0.4 %) and P4 (0.6 %), to reveal the effects of PASP on tobacco growth, K content, sugar content, nicotine content and the ratio of total sugar to nicotine in different tobacco parts, and determine the optimal PASP dosage for regulating the K content and the ratio of total sugar to nicotine in tobacco. The results showed that P1 (0.1 %) and P2 (0.2 %) only had slighter effects on tobacco growth and quality, while P3 (0.4 %) and P4 (0.6 %)treatments significantly promoted dry matter accumulation, increased K and nicotine content in leaves, decreased reducing sugar and total soluble sugar content in leaves, thereby reducing the ratio of total sugar to nicotine in tobacco leaves, especially in upper leaves. Considering the economic cost savings, 0.4% PASP was determined as the best application level to improve the growth and quality of tobacco. Thus, proper application of PASP is beneficial to improve tobacco leaf quality and reduce chemical K fertilizer application, thereby decreasing agricultural environmental risks of chemical fertilizer and alleviating the rapid depletion of potash in the world.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In order to clarify the differences of aroma components between domestic and imported cigars and the material basis of the stylistic characteristics of different cigars, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and sensory evaluation were used to compare and analyze the aroma components in the mainstream smoke of four domestic cigars and two imported cigars. The GC-MS results showed that a total of 97 aroma components were measured in the smoke of the six cigars, and the types of aroma components were similar, but there were differences in their contents.

Primary interventions were behavioral. At intake, participants reporting severe withdrawal or smoking > or = 25 cigarettes daily were offered free nicotine replacement therapy. Baseline data were from an in-person interview. Outcome measures included self-reported smoking status; validation of quitting was by salivary cotinine assays. RESULTS: Of 87 participants providing baseline data, 31% (27) did not join the RCT. Proportions quitting in the CG and IAM group were 11.5% and 13.6% at 6 months and 5.3% and 15.8% at 12 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: African Americans in underserved inner-city neighborhoods can be recruited into RCTs with community participatory approaches. Differences between the CG and IAM in proportions who quit were 2.1% and 10.5% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. More than 3 years with adequate funding, high staffing ratios, and intense outreach and follow-up schedules are needed to achieve recruitment and study goals.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, the underlying mechanisms of these symptoms remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence implicates the hippocampus, a key region in the limbic system, involved in emotional regulation. In this study, we employed transcriptome sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, and integrative multi-omics analysis to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying nicotine withdrawal-induced affective symptoms in the hippocampus of male C57BL/6J mice. Our findings corroborate previous research linking nicotine withdrawal symptoms to dysregulation of neuroendocrine pathways and inflammatory processes within the brain. Importantly, we identify impaired glutathione metabolism as a significant contributing factor to the development of these symptoms. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that theobromine, a principal psychoactive compound found in cocoa, exerts a potent therapeutic effect in alleviating nicotine withdrawal affective symptoms through diverse mechanisms. In addition to its modulation of neuroendocrine pathways and inflammation, theobromine's ability to restore glutathione metabolism in the hippocampus emerges as a pivotal aspect of its pharmacological action.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Despite established interventions, outcomes vary due to scalability issues, resource constraints, and limited reach. OBJECTIVE: To systematically explore current artificial intelligence (AI) applications within tobacco control, highlighting their usefulness, benefits, limitations, and ethical implications. METHOD: This scoping review followed the Arksey and O'Malley framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Five major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and PsycINFO) were searched for articles published between January 2010 and March 2025. From 1,172 initial records, 57 studies met inclusion criteria after screening. RESULTS: AI-driven tools, including machine learning and natural language processing, effectively monitor social media for emerging tobacco trends and personalize smoking cessation interventions. Applications were predominantly focused on predictive modelling (using algorithms like XGBoost and SVM to predict e-cigarette use and relapse risk), cessation support (employing chatbots and reinforcement learning to improve accessibility), and social media surveillance (detecting synthetic nicotine promotions and analysing vaping trends). Approximately 22% of studies aligned with WHO FCTC Article 13 (tobacco advertising regulation), while 45% supported Article 14 (cessation services). However, tobacco industry interference remains a critical challenge, with AI technologies exploited to undermine public health initiatives, target vulnerable populations, and manipulate policy discussions. Critical issues including algorithmic bias, privacy concerns, interpretability challenges, and data quality must be addressed to ensure positive impact. CONCLUSION: AI holds considerable promise for extending tobacco control if implemented ethically, transparently, and collaboratively. Future directions emphasize explainable AI development, integration of real-time intervention systems, global data inclusion, and robust cross-sector collaboration. While the current landscape shows a laudable start, it reflects the need for more diverse skill sets to fully harness AI's extensive prospects for tobacco control and achieving tobacco endgame goals.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We investigated whether young e-cigarette users are susceptible to e-cigarette advertisements. METHODS: Estimates of e-cigarette use and exposure to e-cigarette advertisements from the 2014 National Young Tobacco Survey were investigated. Factors associated with the prevalence and levels of e-cigarette use were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Of all respondents (n = 21,491), 19.8% had tried e-cigarettes and 9.4% were current e-cigarette users. Exposure to e-cigarette ads was prevalent among youth, with 38.6%/29.6%/53.2%/35.4% having medium to high exposure to e-cigarette ads from the Internet/newspapers/stores/TV, respectively. Current use of e-cigarettes among youth was associated with frequent exposure (high vs. low) to e-cigarette advertising from the Internet (odd ratio [OR] = 3.1, p < .0001), newspapers/magazines (OR = 2.5, p < .0001), stores (OR = 2.8, p < .0001), and TV/movies (OR = 2.1, p < .0001). In the multivariate analysis that joint analyzed four advertisement channels and covariates, greater exposure to e-cigarette ads on the Internet (adjusted OR = 1.9, p < .0001) and in retail stores (adjusted OR = 1.9, p < .0001) remained to be significantly associated with increased odds of using e-cigarettes. Vaping by other household members significantly increased the risk of adolescent e-cigarette use (OR = 8.7, p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to e-cigarette ads significantly increased susceptibility to e-cigarette use among adolescents. E-cigarette advertising regulations and educational campaigns are critically needed.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Little is known about the relationship between exposure to e-cigarette marketing at the point-of-sale and youth e-cigarette use. METHODS: Research staff collected data on e-cigarette availability and promotion in tobacco retailers within a half-mile of 41 schools participating in the 2014 New Jersey Youth Tobacco Survey. These data were linked with participant responses from the New Jersey Youth Tobacco Survey (n = 3,909) and log-Poisson regression models estimated adjusted prevalence ratios for ever and past-month e-cigarette use. RESULTS: Nearly a quarter of high school students in New Jersey have tried e-cigarettes (24.1%) and 12.1% were past-month users. Prevalence was highest among males, non-Hispanic whites, and students who have used other tobacco products. After controlling for covariates and the clustered nature of the data, e-cigarette retailer density around schools was positively associated with ever and past-month use of e-cigarettes (p < .05). E-cigarette advertising volume significantly increased the probability of being a past-month e-cigarette user (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.03, p = .031). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the point-of-sale environment around schools may contribute to e-cigarette use among youth. Policy efforts to restrict tobacco promotion at the point-of-sale may play a role in reducing the use of e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We examined the associations between tobacco marketing receptivity and other tobacco product (OTP) use among young adult bar patrons (aged 18-26 years). METHODS: Time-location sampling was used to collect cross-sectional surveys from 7,540 young adult bar patrons from January 2012 through March of 2014. Multivariable logistic regression analyses in 2015 examined if tobacco marketing receptivity was associated (1) with current (past 30 day) OTP use controlling for demographic factors and (2) with dual/poly use among current cigarette smokers (n = 3,045), controlling for demographics and nicotine dependence. RESULTS: Among the entire sample of young adult bar patrons (Meanage = 23.7, standard deviation = 1.8; 48.1% female), marketing receptivity was consistently associated with current use of all OTP including smokeless tobacco (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]= 2.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.08-3.16, p < .001), hookah (AOR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.58-2.43, p < .001), cigarillos (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI 2.21-4.08, p < .001), electronic cigarettes (AOR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.93-3.04, p < .001), and multiple tobacco products (AOR = 2.93, 95% CI 2.45-3.51, p < .001). Among current smokers, marketing receptivity was significantly associated with use of smokeless tobacco (AOR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.22-2.18, p < .01), cigarillos (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.22-2.70, p < .01), and multiple tobacco products (AOR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.27-1.97, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: OTP use is common among young adult bar patrons, and it is associated with tobacco marketing receptivity. Efforts to limit tobacco marketing should address OTP in addition to cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The purpose of this study was to identify reasons why nonsmoking young adults transition from e-cigarette use to cigarette smoking. METHODS: The study used concept mapping (CM), a mixed-method participatory approach. Fifty-five college students who endorsed initiation of e-cigarettes before cigarettes (lifetime e-cigarette uses ≥ 100 and ≥ 100 cigarettes in lifetime) completed at least one part of the study. In an online program, participants brainstormed (n = 54) statements describing reasons for transition from e-cigarette use to cigarette smoking, sorted statements (n = 46) into conceptually similar categories, and rated (n = 47) how true each statement was for them. RESULTS: Participants generated 60 unique statements, and multidimensional scaling analysis generated eight thematic clusters characterizing reasons for transition which included the following: ""Sharing with Others,"" ""Psychological Coping,"" ""Cigarette Appeal,"" ""Reinforcing Effects of Cigarettes,"" ""Accessibility,"" ""Social Influence,"" ""Vaping Stigma,"" and ""Vaping Deficiencies."" Participants rated ""Sharing with Others"" and ""Psychological Coping"" highest (most true) and ""Vaping Deficiencies"" lowest (least true). For college students, the ability to share cigarettes with peers and access cigarettes from peers and smoking for stress/anxiety management were among the top reasons for transition. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that tailored prevention efforts aimed at reducing cigarette smoking uptake among college students who use tobacco as a means for psychological coping or social facilitation may be warranted. Furthermore, regulatory decisions aimed at limiting cigarette appeal, reinforcing effects, and accessibility may be relevant to reducing transition.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed-method design was used. Undergraduates aged 18-24 years at a large southwest university who owned and used a JUUL at least once a week completed an online survey (n = 667) in March 2019. Participant reactions to 6 JUUL-specific statements (harm to lungs and brain, tobacco industry ownership, communication device inside JUUL, harm to others and the environment) were assessed. Then, 51 participants completed an in-person interview 1-2 weeks later to explain what influenced their responses. RESULTS: Across beliefs, females were more likely and those who used other tobacco products were less likely to say they would reduce JUUL use. Beliefs about harm to the brain, others, and the environment had the most influence on interview participants. Tobacco industry affiliation with JUUL was not viewed negatively and likely would not affect participant decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Messaging developed for other tobacco products may not have the same impact with young adult JUUL users. These findings provide guidance to tobacco use regulators by informing marketing message regulations to prevent initiation or prolonged use of JUUL and other pod-based products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Implications for public health will depend on trends in use, including overall use, and who is using these products. This study examined differences over time (2017-2019), across countries (Canada, England, the United States (US)), and by smoking and vaping, in use of other tobacco/nicotine products and overall use. METHODS: The study includes online repeat cross-sectional surveys of youth aged 16-19 years in Canada (N = 11,714), England (N = 11,170), US (N = 11,838) in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Past 30-day use of tobacco/nicotine products (any, cigarette, e-cigarette, other combusted [cigars/cigarillos/waterpipe], other non-combusted [smokeless tobacco/nicotine replacement therapies) were examined by country, year, and, for other combusted and non-combusted products, past 30-day cigarette smoking and vaping. Use of emerging products (IQOS, nicotine pouches) was explored in 2018-2019. RESULTS: From 2017 to 2019, use of any product increased in Canada (17.1%-23.2%, AOR = 1.07 [95% CI = 1.04-1.09]) and the US (18.0%-24.0%, AOR = 1.06 [1.04-1.09]) but not England (20.8%-21.7%, AOR = 1.01 [.99-1.03]). Use of other combusted products (cigars/cigarillos/waterpipe) showed little change (Canada: 8.1%-7.8%; England: 6.3%-7.3%; US: 8.6%-8.5%; p ≥ .151). Use of other non-combusted products (smokeless/nicotine replacement therapies) increased in all countries (Canada: 1.5%-3.2%, AOR = 1.02 [1.01-1.02]; England: 1.4%-2.6%, AOR = 1.02 [1.01-1.03]; US: 3.3%-4.9%, AOR = 1.02 [1.01-1.02]). Vaping increased in all countries (Canada: 8.4%-17.8%; England: 8.7%-12.6%; United States: 11.1%-18.5%; all p < .001). Smokers and vapers reported greater use of other combusted and non-combusted products than those who neither smoked/vaped (p < .001). Emerging product use was rare (≤1.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Youth past 30-day tobacco and nicotine product use increased from 2017 to 2019 in Canada and the United States, largely due to increases in vaping and other non-combusted products. ""Other"" tobacco/nicotine products were used predominantly by youth who smoked cigarettes and/or vaped.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This claim could affect adolescents' smokeless tobacco perceptions and its use. METHODS: Students (N = 592; mean age: 15.3 years; 46% male; 32% nonHispanic White; 8% smokeless tobacco ever-users) at seven California high schools were randomized within a survey to view a Copenhagen snuff image, either with or without the proposed reduced risk claim. Participants were then asked about the harm of smokeless tobacco and their willingness to try Copenhagen snuff if a friend offered. Postimage harm rating and willingness were compared between image groups overall, stratified by past 30-day tobacco use (87% of tobacco users were e-cigarette users), and adjusted for participant characteristics using multivariable regression. RESULTS: Participants who viewed the claim were less likely to perceive smokeless tobacco to cause ""a lot"" of harm (56% vs. 64%; p = .03), including after statistical adjustment (risk ratio [RR]: 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75, 0.94), and with a numerically stronger effect among tobacco users (RR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.86). The claim did not increase willingness overall (17% vs. 20%; p = .41) but did increase willingness among tobacco users (RR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.67). DISCUSSION: Brief exposure to a reduced-risk claim decreased adolescents' smokeless tobacco harm perceptions and increased willingness to try among tobacco users. The Food and Drug Administration order permitting this claim could increase some adolescents' susceptibility to smokeless tobacco, particularly those already using other tobacco products like e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Adolescents are at high risk of exposure due to spending substantial time online. We examined the prevalence of adolescent exposure to online tobacco advertisements and promotions. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Global Youth Tobacco Surveys (GYTS; 2013-2018; average response rate = 76.8%). We included 15 countries in four regions that measured self-reported exposure to tobacco advertising on the internet in the past month (N = 111,356, adolescents aged 11-18): Region of the Americas (Argentina, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Panama, Paraguay, Peru), African (Mauritius, Zimbabwe), European (Czech Republic, Turkey), and the Western Pacific (Micronesia, Macao, Papua New Guinea, Samoa). We calculated the prevalence of online exposure to tobacco advertising by past-month cigarette use. RESULTS: Prevalence of adolescent exposure to online advertisements for tobacco products ranged from 18.2%-34.3% and 12.3%-34.4% for tobacco advertisements that ""looked fun or cool"". Exposure to online tobacco product advertisements was prevalent across countries, including those with advertising bans in place, and included adolescents who have never smoked (14.4%-28.4% exposed to any, 9.1%-31.0% exposed to fun or cool advertisements). Reporting seeing tobacco advertising online that looked fun or cool was positively associated with the prevalence of past-month smoking (r = 0.64, p = .010). DISCUSSION: A substantial proportion of adolescents in countries that have banned tobacco advertising are still exposed to advertisements for tobacco products online.

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials involving adult smokers and reporting oral adverse events (e.g., mouth irritation, dry mouth, aphthous ulcers) were included. PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched up to August 2024. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2, and evidence certainty with CINeMA. RESULTS: Thirty-six trials were included, with 21 contributing to the network meta-analysis. Most comparisons with placebo showed no significant differences across four primary outcomes. The odds of developing aphthous ulcers were significantly higher in the nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) gum group compared with standard of care (OR = 2.36; 95 % CI: 1.05-5.30). Higher odds of mouth irritation were also observed for e-cig (OR = 4.06; 95 % CI: 1.67-9.85), NRT mouth spray (OR = 4.36; 95 % CI: 1.14-16.63), NRT gum (OR = 4.25; 95 % CI: 1.51-11.94) and snus (OR = 13.56; 95 % CI: 1.07-171.52) when compared with standard of care. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the main findings. Secondary outcomes revealed isolated associations but were based on limited data. Evidence certainty was low to very low due mainly to imprecision and risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: NCNPs appear to be generally well tolerated. Most placebo comparisons showed no increased risk, although some products exhibited higher odds of aphthous ulcers and mouth irritation compared with standard of care. Better reporting of oral adverse events in RCTs is needed. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Given the current limitations of the evidence base, dental professionals should play an active role in tobacco harm reduction strategies by monitoring oral health during NCNP use and supporting product choice based on safety, tolerability, and individual patient needs.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: This secondary data analysis was based on 36 RCTs included in a previous systematic review. Trials involved adult smokers and included nicotine replacement therapy, electronic cigarettes, heated tobacco, and smokeless tobacco. The OAE reporting was evaluated using an adapted CONSORT Harms checklist. An Adjusted Checklist Score (ACS), representing the proportion of criteria met, was calculated. Univariate linear regressions explored the association between ACS and study-level variables (publication year, country, funding, blinding and product type). RESULTS: OAE reporting was fragmented, with a mean ACS of 0.52 (0.11-0.74). Over 80 % of studies (n=30) provided some quantitative data, but only 53 % (n=19) presented results in a tabulated, arm-specific format. Definitions of OAEs and severity measurement were rarely reported (n=5, 14 % and n=6, 17 % respectively). The method of OAEs collection was described in 50 % of the studies (n=18). OAEs were rarely mentioned in titles (n=4, 11 %) and conclusions (n=13, 36 %). Less than half of the studies reported the reasons for participant withdrawal due to AEs (n=16, 44 %). Only 28 % (n=10) and 44 % (n=16) of the studies reported the analysis approach and statistical methods for AEs, respectively. A weak, non-significant positive correlation was found between ACS and year of publication (r = 0.288, p = 0.09). No study-level variable showed a statistically significant association with ACS. CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of OAEs in clinical trials of NCNPs remains limited and inconsistent, often lacking clear definitions, standardized severity assessments, detailed data collection methods, and predefined statistical plans. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Standardized OAE reporting is critical for tolerability data interpretation. We propose practical recommendations to guide researchers in improving the reporting of OAE and strengthening the role of dental professionals in supporting patients through smoking cessation strategies.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This results in the considerable generation of toxic waste materials from the tobacco industry and daily life. Conventional disposal methods for them (incineration and landfilling) could be a potential hazard for releasing carcinogens and toxins into our eco-system. Accordingly, an eco-friendly disposal platform for converting tobacco waste (TW) into syngas was mainly studied in this present work. To realize this, pyrolysis of two commercial cigarette products (Marlboro and HEETS (electronic cigarette)) was done under the CO2/N2 conditions. One of the main findings from the present study was that CO2 reacted with volatile matters (VMs) obtained from the thermolysis of TW through the gas phase reactions (GPRs), which provided a strategic measure to manipulate carbon rearrangement of all pyrolysates. In particular, the GPRs expedited the carbon rearrangement of harmful chemical species, converting toxic chemicals into syngas. When the fraction of VMs in TWs increased, the GPR were more effective. Therefore, the introduced eco-friendly method using CO2-mediated thermochemical process could be beneficial for energy recovery from TWs while mitigating the formations of harmful chemical species.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

J-6 and its degradation pathways.,"This study isolated a myosmine-degrading bacterial strain J-6 from tobacco-growing soil. The identification of this strain revealed it to be a new species within the genus Sphingopyxis. Analysis of the myosmine degradation products by HPLC, preparative HPLC, and UHPLC-MS/MS identified 8 metabolites, among which 3-pyridylacetic acid (3-PAA), 5-(3-pyridyl)tetrahydrofuranone-2 (PTHF), and 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoic acid (HPBA) were three novel metabolites that were not previously found in microbial degradation of tobacco alkaloids. Interestingly, these metabolites have been observed in the nicotine metabolic pathways of humans and animals. In addition, 3-PAA, which is believed to be the major end product of nicotine metabolism in humans, is also found to be an end product of myosmine degradation in strain J-6. Based on the identified metabolites and genomic analysis, a previously unreported bacterial degradation pathway for tobacco alkaloids was proposed. The downstream part of this pathway for converting SP to 3-PAA resembles the pathway for mammalian metabolism of SP to 3-PAA. Overall, the findings in this study offer novel insights into the degradation pathways and mechanisms of myosmine, which will deepen our understanding on the fate of myosmine both in the environment and within the human body.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We estimated models of smoking cessation during pregnancy at the individual, provider and national levels. The rate of smoking cessation during pregnancy increased from 15.4% in 2007 to 42.7% in 2013. National-level non-price policies had the largest estimated impact on cessation. The price response of the tobacco industry attenuated the effects of tax increases. While provider-level interventions had a significant effect, they were adopted by relatively few health centers. Quitting during pregnancy increased birth weight by an estimated 188 g. Tobacco control measures had no effect on the birth weight of newborns of non-smoking women.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

STUDY DESIGN: As part of the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes Program, we harmonized prenatal substance use data and child behavior outcomes from 2195 women and their 6- to 11-year-old children across 10 cohorts in the US and used latent class-adjusted regression models to predict parent-rated child behavior. RESULTS: Three latent classes fit the data: low use (90.5%; n = 1986), primarily using no substances; licit use (6.6%; n = 145), mainly using nicotine with a moderate likelihood of using alcohol and marijuana; and illicit use (2.9%; n = 64), predominantly using illicit substances along with a moderate likelihood of using licit substances. Children exposed to primarily licit substances in utero had greater levels of externalizing behavior than children exposed to low or no substances (P = .001, d = .64). Children exposed to illicit substances in utero showed small but significant elevations in internalizing behavior than children exposed to low or no substances (P < .001, d = .16). CONCLUSIONS: The differences in prenatal polysubstance use may increase risk for specific childhood problem behaviors; however, child outcomes appeared comparably adverse for both licit and illicit polysubstance exposure.

The purpose of this study was to study the relationship between tobacco abstinence and use of QL services among low-income smokers. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a randomized trial of every- or some-day smokers aged 18 years or older visiting an urban emergency department. Inclusion criteria included self-pay or Medicaid insurance, as a proxy for low-income and low socioeconomic status. Intervention participants received a motivational interview, 6 weeks of nicotine patches and gum, a referral faxed to the state-sponsored QL, a booster call, and a quitline brochure. Control participants received the brochure. Smoking status was assessed by phone at 1 and 3 months, with confirmation via exhaled carbon monoxide testing at 3 months for those reporting abstinence. QL usage was obtained by utilization data from the QL database. RESULTS: Of 778 subjects, 197 (25.3%) reported any use of QL services at 3 months. Participants were trichotomized: no QL usage, 1 call only, and >1 call (583, 99, and 98 participants, respectively). Quit rates at 3 months in these no, low-, and high-use groups were, respectively, 7.2%, 9.1%, and 15.3% (P=0.03). Participants who used the QL had a median of 28 total minutes of telephone contact. CONCLUSION: Among low-income smokers, greater use of QL services is associated with higher abstinence. Whether this resulted from a direct effect of the QL, or greater motivation among smokers using QL services cannot be determined from these data.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Participants were 363 adolescents aged 12-17 (66% male, mean age = 15.5 [SD = 1.3], 46% non-Hispanic white) seen for a specialty addiction intake evaluation between 2017 and 2019 at one of six medical offices of a large, integrated health care system in Northern California. Multivariable logistic regression models tested for associations of sociodemographics, cigarette smoking, and substance use disorders with vaping behaviors. A majority of adolescents reported ever (68%) or current vaping (60%) of nicotine and/or cannabis; current vaping was similar for nicotine (50%) and cannabis (51%); 40% reported current vaping of both. Current smokers (6% of the sample) had higher odds of ever vaping (aOR = 3.95, 95%CI: 1.04-14.95). Black (versus non-Hispanic white) adolescents had lower odds of current nicotine vaping (aOR = 0.08, 95%CI: 0.02-0.37) and current vaping of both nicotine and cannabis (aOR = 0.12, 95%CI: 0.03-0.60). Having an alcohol use disorder was associated with current vaping (aOR = 2.14, 95%CI: 1.06-4.33). Those who endorsed that most friends get drunk/high (aOR = 1.87, 95%CI: 1.02-3.42) or that cannabis was their substance of choice (aOR = 2.36, 95%CI: 1.16-4.81) had higher odds of current cannabis vaping.

METHODS: Between 2016 and 2020, 188 patients were enrolled in a two-phase, sequential, randomized controlled trial. Phase 1 evaluated whether standard of care (SC) (five in-person counseling sessions and 8 weeks of nicotine patch) plus gain-framed messaging (GFM) versus SC would increase 8-week biochemically verified smoking cessation rates. In 143 participants randomized in phase 2, we tested whether feedback on smoking-related biomarkers would reduce 6-month self-reported number of cigarettes smoked per day compared with a no feedback control. Chi-square test and mixed effects repeated measures analyses were used to evaluate group differences. RESULTS: Participants were 62.5 ± 5.6 (mean ± SD) years of age, had a 50.3 ± 21 pack-year smoking history, and were smoking 16.9 ± 9.9 cigarettes per day. At 8 weeks, there was no difference in quit rates between those randomized to SC plus GFM (n = 15 of 93, 16.1%) and those randomized to SC (n = 16 of 95, 16.8%), with p equals to 0.90. At the 6-month post-randomization follow-up, number of cigarettes smoked per day was similar in the feedback (least-squares mean = 7.5, 95% confidence interval: 6.0-9.1) and no feedback arms (7.7, 95% confidence interval: 6.2-9.3), with p equals to 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: Gain-framed messaging and health feedback did not significantly improve quit rates relative to comprehensive standard of care. Nevertheless, the overall program achieved clinically meaningful smoking quit rates in this older high pack-year cohort, highlighting the importance of intensive tobacco treatment for patients undergoing lung cancer screening.

In 2006, we examined intended quit attempts using hypothetical questions. Since then, a price increase for cigarettes has been proposed and has come closer to being realized. OBJECTIVE: To examine attitude changes in intending to quit attempts according to the reinforcement of tobacco control policies and to clarify the attitudes toward the smoking policies under debate. METHOD: In July 2006, a discrete choice experiment was performed in 616 current smokers. In January 2010, we conducted the same discrete choice experiment in 600 current smokers. In addition, we investigated attitudes toward increased cigarette price and amendments to the laws regulating the tobacco industry. RESULTS: In general, between 2006 and 2010, the discrete choice experiment indicated that the smoking continuation rate decreased for highly dependent smokers and increased for low and moderately dependent smokers. Regarding individual measures, increases in tobacco price consistently persuaded smokers of all dependence levels to attempt to quit smoking, whereas factors such as risk information and a smoking ban were effective only for low-dependence smokers. Current smokers show less support for a price increase and legislation of health promotion than nonsmokers. Of current smokers, those with greater nicotine dependence support these policies less. CONCLUSIONS: The shift of preference for intended attempts to quit is diverse according to nicotine dependence. These differences may be derived from the variations of their time and risk preference and their trust in the tobacco price policies.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Americas,Reduced nicotine in cigarettes in a marketplace with alternative nicotine systems: randomized clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: Reducing cigarette addictiveness has the potential to avert millions of yearly tobacco-related deaths worldwide. Substantially reducing nicotine in cigarettes decreases cigarette consumption, but no large clinical trial has determined the effects of reduced-nicotine cigarettes when other nicotine-containing products are available. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of reduced-nicotine cigarettes in the context of the availability of alternative nicotine delivery systems. METHODS: In a U.S. six-site, open-label, parallel-arm study, smokers were randomized for twelve weeks to an experimental marketplace containing cigarettes with either 0.4 mg or 15.8 mg nicotine per gram of tobacco; all had access to non-combusted alternative nicotine delivery systems (e.g., e-cigarettes; medicinal nicotine). Group differences in the primary outcomes (cigarettes per day, number of smoke-free days) were examined using linear and negative binomial regression, respectively (Trial Registration: NCT03272685). FINDINGS: Among 438 randomized participants (mean [standard deviation (SD), range] age, 44.5 [11.9, 20-73] years, 225 [51.4%] women, 282 [64.4%] White and 339 [77.4%] trial completers), those in the 0.4 mg vs. 15.8 mg nicotine cigarette condition experienced significantly lower cigarettes per day at the end of intervention (mean [SD], 7.05 [7.88] vs. 12.95 [9.07], adjusted mean difference, -6.21 [95% CI, -7.66 to -4.75], P < 0.0001) and greater smoke-free days during intervention (mean [SD], 18.59 [27.97] vs. 5.06 [13.77], adjusted rate ratio, 4.25 [95% CI, 2.58-6.98], P < 0.0001).

We examined the impact of standardised vape packaging and flavour names on appeal to youth and adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional (between-subjects) experimental study used data from the 2024 Action on Smoking and Health Youth (n = 2,770, aged 11-18), and a 2024 Prolific Academic (n = 3,947, aged 18+), surveys. Participants were randomised to one condition from: (1) branded packs (control), (2) standardised white with usual descriptors (e.g., blu razz) (3) standardised white with limited flavour descriptors (e.g., blueberry and raspberry), and among adults only (4) standardised white with coded flavour descriptors (e.g., FR248). Youth reported perceived peer interest in trying the products, adults reported their own interest and perceived harm relative to cigarettes. Logistic regression examined associations between packaging and interest or harm perceptions, adjusting for demographics. FINDINGS: Differences between packaging types were small in percentage terms, but some reached significance. Youth reported higher odds of no perceived peer interest in trying vapes in standardised packs (31.5% (n = 292/927); aOR = 1.85 [95%CI = 1.47-2.32], p < 0.001), and standardised packs with limited flavour descriptors (27.2% (n = 252/927); 1.50 [1.19-1.90], p < 0.001), vs. branded packs (24.0% (220/916)). Adults reported higher odds of no interest in trying standardised packs with coded flavour descriptors (76.2% (776/1019); 1.52 [1.18-1.97], p < 0.001), but not usual (75.4% (n = 713/946); 1.28 [0.99-1.65], p = 0.063) or limited (70.1% (n = 657/937); 0.90 [0.70-1.15], p = 0.392) flavour descriptors, compared to branded (71.5% (n = 693/969)).

These products include electronic cigarettes, waterpipes/hookah, cigars/cigarillo, smokeless tobacco, and heat-not-burn cigarettes. The observed increase in the use of ETRPs is multifactorial and complex but appears to be mainly driven by efforts from the major tobacco companies to reinvent themselves, and present more appealing and allegedly safe(r) tobacco products. However, it is becoming apparent that these products produce substantial amounts of toxic chemicals, many of which have been shown to exert negative health effects, including in the context of the cardiovascular system. Thus, there has been research efforts, albeit limited in general, to characterize the health impact of these products on occlusive/thrombotic cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In this review, we will discuss the potential impact of ETRPs on thrombosis-based CVD. Specifically, we will review how these products and the major chemicals they produce and/or emit can trigger key players in the process of thrombosis, namely inflammation, oxidative stress, platelets, coagulation, and the vascular endothelium, and the relationship between these effects.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Although smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, there is still widespread use of conventional cigarettes. Recently, the tobacco industry has been transformed by the introduction of electronic cigarettes (ECs), which have lower levels of carcinogens and may provide a safer alternative. Here, we investigate the ability of EC liquids and aerosols to induce an EMT in A549 lung cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to EC liquids and aerosols from a popular product for 3-8 days. Live cell imaging, EMT biomarker analysis, and machine learning/image processing algorithms were used to characterize changes associated with EMT. RESULTS: Long-term exposure of A549 cells to menthol or tobacco-flavored EC liquids or aerosols induced an EMT that was characterized by acquisition of a fibroblast-like morphology, loss of cell-to-cell junctions, internalization of E-cadherin, increased motility, and upregulation of other EMT markers. The EMT was concurrent with plasma membrane to nuclear translocation of active β-catenin. CONCLUSION: This is the first known study to show an EMT of lung cancer cells during exposure to EC products. Because an EMT is an initial step leading to metastasis, an intractable problem that often leads to patient death, this critical finding has significant implications for former or heavy cigarette smokers who are using EC and may be at risk for lung cancer or who may already have a lung tumor.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

To weaken the link between nicotine reinforcement and the toxicity associated with combusted tobacco, the United States Food and Drug Administration is considering a product standard targeting cigarette nicotine content. In this review, we summarize research assessing the potential impacts of reducing nicotine in cigarettes. Evidence to date suggests cigarette smoking, toxicant exposure and dependence would decline following substantial reductions in nicotine content. However, reduced nicotine content may not eliminate smoking entirely. Regulatory efforts that shape the nicotine and tobacco marketplace should consider that non-nicotine reinforcing factors and decision-making biases can contribute to the value of smoking. The impact of reducing nicotine in cigarettes will likely depend on the alternative nicotine products available to current smokers.

However, these products are addictive and not safe as they contain nicotine. Harm reduction is a false solution as it represents a commercial strategy of the tobacco industry to increase its sales, making it difficult to control smoking, since it keeps smokers from consuming tobacco and prevents them from making serious attempts to quit.

Interindividual variability in nicotine metabolism rate may influence treatment response. This study sought to validate, and extend in a larger sample, our previous finding that the ratio of plasma nicotine metabolites 3'-hydroxycotinine (3-HC)/cotinine, a measure of nicotine metabolism rate, predicts response to nicotine patch. A sample of 568 smokers was enrolled in a study that provided counseling and 8-weeks of 21 mg nicotine patch. Pretreatment 3-HC/cotinine ratio was examined as a predictor of 7-day point prevalence abstinence, verified with breath carbon monoxide (CO), 8 weeks after the quit date. Controlling for sex, race, age, and nicotine dependence, smokers in the upper 3 quartiles of 3-HC/cotinine ratio (faster metabolizers) were approximately 50% less likely to be abstinent vs. smokers in the first quartile (slow metabolizers; 28% vs. 42%; OR=.54 [95% CI:.36-.82], p=.003). Among abstainers, plasma nicotine levels (assessed 1 week after treatment began) decreased linearly across the 3-HC/cotinine ratio (beta=-3.38, t[355]=-3.09, p<.05). These data support the value of the 3-HC/cotinine ratio as a biomarker to predict success with transdermal nicotine for smoking cessation.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Individuals who metabolize nicotine faster (higher NMR) may alter their smoking behavior to titrate their nicotine intake in order to maintain similar levels of nicotine in the body compared to slower nicotine metabolizers. There are known racial differences in the rate of nicotine metabolism with African Americans on average having a slower rate of nicotine metabolism compared to Whites. The goal of this study was to determine if there are racial differences in the relationship between rate of nicotine metabolism and measures of nicotine intake assessed using multiple biomarkers of nicotine and tobacco smoke exposure. Using secondary analyses of the screening data collected in a recently completed clinical trial, treatment-seeking African American and White daily smokers (10 or more cigarettes per day) were grouped into NMR quartiles so that the races could be compared at the same NMR, even though the distribution of NMR within race differed. The results indicated that rate of nicotine metabolism was a more important factor influencing nicotine intake in White smokers. Specifically, Whites were more likely to titrate their nicotine intake based on the rate at which they metabolize nicotine. However, this relationship was not found in African Americans. Overall there was a greater step-down, linear type relationship between NMR groups and cotinine or cotinine/cigarette in African Americans, which is consistent with the idea that differences in blood cotinine levels between the African American NMR groups were primarily due to differences in CYP2A6 enzyme activity without titration of nicotine intake among faster nicotine metabolizers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, the association between nicotine metabolic rate (NMR) and cognitive functioning during withdrawal has not been determined. METHODS: We compared cognitive function in 121 fast or slow nicotine metabolizers after smoking, and at 3 and 6 h of nicotine abstinence. Cognitive functioning was assessed using N-back working memory tests with outcomes of accuracy and processing speed. Participants smoked two cigarettes and then abstained from smoking for 6 h. N-back tests were administered after smoking (0 h) and at 3 and 6 h of nicotine abstinence. RESULTS: An effect of processing speed was found over time on the 2-back, in that participants had significantly longer average reaction times when the stimuli presented did not match the target letter. NMR was not significantly associated with the processing speed change over time. Within-race differences in working memory were evident in that Caucasian fast metabolizers had significantly poorer accuracy and processing speed. CONCLUSIONS: Minimal change in working memory over 6 h of nicotine abstinence was observed. Overall, NMR was not significantly associated with the change in processing speed, however Caucasian fast metabolizers displayed poorer accuracy and processing speed at discrete time points.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Nicotine exposure is a health concern not only for adults but also has neurotoxic effects on the fetus, newborn, child, and adolescent. In this review, we aim to highlight the dynamic roles of nAChRs throughout gestation, adolescence, and adulthood.

The increased popularity and weak regulation of electronic cigarettes have created a new generation of smokers who mistakenly believe they are ""safer"" from harm.

We examined how physicians from Ontario university health clinics intervene with these young adult smokers. METHOD: A convenience sample of 16 universities was identified and surveys were hand-delivered to all 228 physicians from these schools. A total of 125 doctors (54.82%) responded; 70 were from universities that were involved in a government-sponsored, coordinated, multi-campus, tobacco control initiative. RESULTS: Twenty percent of doctors reported asking all or almost all patients about tobacco use; 25.22% asked fewer than half. Describing how they respond to patients identified as smokers, 96.00% of physicians advised cessation, 72.00% offered assistance, and 64.00% arranged for follow-up. Doctors discussed patients' tobacco use with 78.59% of smokers. Nicotine replacement therapies were rarely offered to patients wanting to quit. Doctors from universities involved in the tobacco control initiative were more likely to keep patient education materials in the examining room. CONCLUSION: Because most doctors ask only some patients about tobacco use, they may be missing opportunities to provide appropriate advice and assistance to all smokers.

JY-Q.","Nicotine contamination in tobacco waste effluent (TWE) from tobacco industry is a serious threat to public health and environment. Microbial degradation is an impending approach to remove nicotine and transform it into some other high value chemicals. Pseudomonas sp. JY-Q exhibits high efficiency of degradation, which can degrade 5 g/L of nicotine within 24 h. In strain JY-Q, we found the co-occurrence of two homologous key enzymes NicA2 and Nox, which catalyze nicotine to N-methylmyosmine, and then to pseudooxylnicotine via simultaneous hydrolysis. In this study, recombinant NicA2 and Nox were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified. In vitro, the activity of recombinant NicA2 and Nox was accelerated by adding co-factor NAD+, suggesting that they worked as dehydrogenases. The optimal reaction conditions, substrate affinity, catabolism efficiency, pH-stability and thermal-stability were determined. Nox showed lower efficiency, but at a higher stability level than NicA2. Nox exhibited wider pH range and higher temperature as optimal conditions for the enzymatic reaction. In addition, The Nox showed higher thermo-stability and acid-stability than that of NicA2. The study on enzymatic reaction kinetics showed that Nox had a lower Km and higher substrate affinity than NicA2. These results suggest that Nox plays more significant role than NicA2 in nicotine degradation in TWE, which usually is processed at low pH (4-5) and high temperature (above 40 °C). Genetic engineering is required to enhance the affinity and suitability of NicA2 for an increased additive effect on homologous NicA2 and Nox in strain JY-Q.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This is a particularly important gap in the literature given nicotine replacement therapy is advocated in pregnancy for mothers who are unable to cease smoking. The intent of this scoping review is to critique the magnitude and quality of evidence on the impact of NST&N containing products on human placental health to inform clinical practice and direct future research. PubMed and Web of Science and their reference lists were searched to the end of November 2024 identifying 949 papers; screening by two independent reviewers eliminated 813 papers. Full text review eliminated a further 118 papers with 18 remaining for full extraction. The synthesis was challenged by widely different populations, dissimilar NST&N products and disparate reporting. Nevertheless, the findings indicate that the use of NST&N products results in placental hypoxia-related changes, as evidenced by increased resistance in the maternal-placental-foetal unit and significant upregulation of 8-OHdG. In addition, cytoplasmic HIF-1α expression and several ABC/SLC transporters are impacted. The pathological response to these hypoxia-induced changes is evidenced as placental morphology changes with increased subtrophoblastic membrane, decreased syncytial cytoplasm, necrotic areas in syncytium of placental villi, increased syncytial knots and apoptotic cells, and excessive collagen-factors which altered placenta size, weight, and haemodynamic parameters. These findings indicate maternal use of NST&N is not safe for the placenta.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In contrast, a spontaneous cherry-red variant (CR60) primarily accumulates nornicotine, accompanied by distinctive red dapples on the cured leaves. In this study, suppression of conversion of nicotine to nornicotine by genome editing resulted in decreased nornicotine and N-acyl nornicotines (NacNNs), and the subsequent disappearance of red dapples in CR60. Conversely, overexpression of CYP82E4 increased nornicotine and NacNNs accumulation, inducing a red dapple phenotype in common tobacco. Notably, nicotine conversion triggered significant alterations in leaf total sugars, alkaloids, and nitrogens. Metabolome analyses using 1352 identified compounds indicated nicotine conversion dramatically affected the entire metabolic network and induced unique metabolic responses across diverse genetic backgrounds. Further WGCNA analysis revealed that nicotine conversion caused substantial contents variation of alkaloids, flavonoids and amino acids and derivatives in cured leaves. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying red dapple formation in cherry-red tobacco, elucidating profound influence of nicotine conversion on entire metabolic network.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (InDels), structural variations (SVs), and copy-number variations (CNVs) were then identified in each tobacco variety. Furthermore, a functional analysis of mutated genes was carried out. Through in-depth comparative analysis of genomes of different tobacco varieties, we identified genome variations in a number of SNPs, InDels, SVs, and CNVs, respectively. Computational analysis to predict the function of mutated genes containing these differential SNPs, InDels, SVs, and CNVs showed that they were mainly involved in different functions, such as carbohydrate metabolism and secondary metabolites biosynthesis. We mainly focused on genes that were involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and nicotine metabolism. In addition, we identified five simple sequence repeat (SSR)-based markers and verified them by PCR amplification in 10 tobacco varieties. Taken together, our study increases the understanding of genetic differences between tobacco types or varieties and identifies five SSR markers to classify tobacco varieties or types.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, most studies on quit intentions have been conducted in high-income countries with very few in low- and middle-income countries particularly in Africa. This is the first population-based study to compare factors associated with quit intentions among smokers in two African countries. Data were from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Kenya and Zambia Surveys (2012), face-to-face surveys of nationally representative samples of 2291 adult smokers (Kenya = 1103; Zambia = 1188). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of quit intentions. Most Kenyan (65.1%) and Zambian (69.1%) smokers had quit intentions of which 54.8% planned to quit within the next 6 months. Five factors were significantly associated with quit intentions in both countries: being younger, having tried to quit previously, perceiving that quitting is beneficial to health, worrying about future health consequences of smoking, and being low in nicotine dependence. The predictive strength of these factors did not differ in the two countries. Four additional factors were significant predictors in Zambia only: having a quit attempt lasting six months or more, lower smoking enjoyment, having a negative opinion about smoking, and concern about cigarette expenses. The factors predicting quit intentions were similar to those in other ITC countries including Canada, US, UK, China and Mauritius. These findings highlight the need for stronger tobacco control policies in Kenya and Zambia including increased taxation, greater access to cessation services, and anti-smoking campaigns denormalizing tobacco use.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The impact of MRTP claims to promote harm reduction may be limited by perceptions that claims come from the tobacco industry, lack of attention, and the simultaneous presence of health warnings on ads, which may be perceived as conflicting information. Some studies have examined the potential of alternative ""modified risk warnings"". We aimed to contribute to this literature by exploring issues of claim attention, perceived source and credibility when viewing MRTP claims within or outside of a warning label. We conducted 11 focus groups with adult smokers and young adult (ages 18-25) non-smokers (n = 54) who viewed three e-cigarette or snus advertisements which varied in where an MRTP message was placed: outside the warning label, inside the warning label, or in a modified label style. Results suggest that MRTP claims presented within or in the style of a warning label (compared to claims outside the label), may be perceived as coming from a government or health-related source rather than a tobacco industry, and thus seem more credible. Yet these formats may receive insufficient message attention, as they are smaller and appear as part of labels consumers are accustomed to ignoring. Future research should further probe effects of MRTP statements and how they vary by message source, channel and format.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Existing research on target marketing is focused on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. In contrast, studies of target marketing of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)-a growing segment of the U.S. tobacco product market - are much more limited. We analyzed data on 496 ENDS ads and audience demographics to explore the extent to which flavored ENDS ads on cable television (n = 25 ads), terrestrial radio (n = 412 ads), and in print consumer magazines (n = 59 ads) are targeted to different demographic groups based on age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We observed flavor-related content in one-quarter to one-third of ENDS ad occurrences during 2019-2020. Across all media outlets examined, audience age was an important factor in explaining the likelihood of ENDS ads containing flavor-related content. For example, within a television channel, there were 3.82 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.39-10.49] times greater odds that an ENDS ad contained flavor-related content versus not for every 1% increase in the proportion of U.S. youth ages 6-17 watching a television show.

Race/ethnicity was an important explanatory factor for the presence of flavor-related content on radio but not television ENDS ads. Our findings suggest differences in target marketing of flavored ENDS by media outlet and audience demographics.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

RESULTS: Overall, 45.2 % were aware of NPs, and 17.4 % ever used NPs. Highest reported NP awareness was through stores (16.6 %), internet/social media ads (9.2 %), friends/family's social media (8.2 %), direct mail/email (7.6 %), and print media ads (6.9 %). Younger, female, Black and Hispanic (vs. White) adults had lower odds of NP awareness through various marketing channels than their counterparts. Black adults (vs. White) had higher odds of NP awareness through news stories on TV/radio/online. Awareness through each channel was associated with higher odds of ever-using NPs, especially brand sponsored events, brand website/social media accounts, and direct mail/email (p's < 0.05). Results were generally consistent when stratified by race/ethnicity, but notable differences were also observed (race/ethnicity interaction p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NP marketing may promote NP experimentation among U.S. adults who use commercial tobacco. Future research should examine whether exposure to NP marketing leads to poly-tobacco use, which could increase the detrimental health effects of tobacco use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: Data are from the 2022 US ITC Smoking and Vaping Survey. Respondents were recruited from a web panel of a nationally representative sample of US adults ages 18+ who smoked, formerly smoked, and/or vaped ENDS. Using weighted data, we estimated prevalence of current vaping among adults who smoke or formerly smoked (N = 2,016). Among the subset who vaped (n = 554), we assessed flavors and devices used most often. Using unweighted data, we assessed the frequency (count) of reported brands used most often. RESULTS: In 2022, 22.0 % of US adults who smoked or formerly smoked were vaping at least monthly. A significantly higher proportion of adults who formerly smoked and/or were younger (18-39) were vaping than adults who were smoking and/or were older (40+) (both p < 0.001). Tank devices were used most often (34.7 %), followed by disposables (27.4 %), pre-filled pods/cartridges (23.0 %), and refillable pods/cartridges (14.9 %). The five most commonly used flavors were fruit (33.9 %), tobacco (20.1 %), menthol (12.2 %), candy/sweets (10.8 %), and mixed ice flavors (10.0 %). The top 5 brands were JUUL, Smok, Vuse, Geekvape, and Blu. CONCLUSIONS: In 2022, a majority of adults who smoked cigarettes or who had quit smoking used a variety of flavors and devices that go beyond the choices that FDA currently has authorized for sale.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

METHOD: The analysis of a 1973 RJReynols® document identified ten physical and psychological factors in order to increase the number of young users for a brand of cigarettes. These young people are classified into three groups: pre-smokers, learners and smokers. RESULT: The taste for pre-smokers and learners and nicotine for smokers are main physical parameters. The industry clearly knows that tobacco is mainly consumed because of nicotine addiction, so it is necessary to make adolescents addict. It is interesting to note that cigarette pack was in 1973 a positive factor to attract young smokers, whereas now with the arrival of the neutral packaging, the tobacco industry declares that packaging has no influence to attract teenagers ! Of the psychological factors, the only negative factor is the self-image of the smoker. The tobacco industry already recognized in 1973 that smokers were unhappy about smoking. For learners, self-image and the experience of adults are most important factor, which is why the industry strives to create a positive image and convey message that smoking initiation is a ritual to become adult. According to the tobacco industry, stress and alleviation of boredom are also important points in turning pre-smokers into learners and learners into smokers. CONCLUSION: This article aims to provide practical tools for understanding industry initiatives targeting adolescents. The attached tool can be used by the teens or adults involved to understand the optimization of teenagers tobacco marketing.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

These devices have been misleadingly marketed as ""less harmful"" alternatives to conventional smoking tobacco products. The e-liquid in e-cigarettes include nicotine, a humectant and other additives including flavourings, colourants, or adulterants such as bacterial and fungal products. In this review, we discuss the contrasting views of the tobacco lobby and most professional societies. We describe the epidemiology of the use of these devices, with a widespread and significant rise in youth e-cigarette use seen in both the USA and Europe. We also describe what is known about the toxicity and mechanisms of EVALI (e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury). This characterised by respiratory failure with an intense inflammatory response. The presentations are diverse and clinicians should consider vaping as a possible cause of any unusual respiratory illness in patients who have a history of vaping or other use of e-cigarette-related products. Second hand exposure to e-cigarettes is also harmful through respiration and transdermal absorption. E-cigarettes have a worse acute toxicity than tobacco and their long-term toxicity is unknown, and we advocate for the immediate, most vigorous anti-vaping legislation possible.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

High rates of caffeine use have been observed in adult smokers as well as those with serious mental illness. The current secondary analysis aimed to extend previous findings demonstrating high caffeine intake in schizophrenia by examining dietary intake of caffeine and serum caffeine levels in outpatient smokers with schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BP) and control smokers with no psychiatric diagnoses (CON). Two hundred forty-eight adult smokers (SCZ=80; BP=80; CON=88) were included in the current study. Adult smokers with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and no psychiatric diagnoses were 40.85 (SD = 11.90) years old on average and all participants were current smokers (∼20 cigarettes per day). Twenty-four hour self-reported caffeine intake (in mg) was highest among individuals with bipolar disorder (median=195.3), followed by adults with schizophrenia (median=155.0) and controls (median=131.7). Participants with bipolar disorder also had the highest serum caffeine levels (in ng/ml; median=1725), followed by those with schizophrenia (median=1194) and controls (median=613.2). These results provide additional evidence of high caffeine intake among adults with schizophrenia and extend findings by identifying even higher rates of caffeine use in those with bipolar disorder.

It is now possible to modulate the activity of the neurocircuitry associated with nicotine dependence using repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive neurostimulation approach, which has recently demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials and received regulatory approval in the US and Canada. However there remains a paucity of replication studies and real-world patient effectiveness data as access to this intervention is extremely limited. There are a number of unique challenges related to the delivery of rTMS that need to be addressed prior to widespread adoption and implementation of this treatment modality for smoking cessation. In this paper, we review the accessibility, scientific, technological, economical, and social challenges that remain before this treatment can be translated into clinical practice. By addressing these remaining barriers and scientific challenges with rTMS for smoking cessation and delineating implementation strategies, we can greatly reduce the burden of tobacco-related disease worldwide.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

The role of law in promoting tobacco harm reduction using low nitrosamine smokeless tobacco products.,"In Sweden, male cigarette smoking has declined as snus, a smokeless tobacco product which is low in carcinogenic nitrosamines, has gained popularity among male tobacco users. Epidemiological modelling based on the Swedish experience indicates that there would be major public health gains if a substantial number of current smokers in other countries could also be persuaded to switch to this product. This form of 'tobacco harm reduction' is very controversial in the public health community for many reasons. These include: objections in principle to the use of less harmful but still addictive nicotine products; uncertainties about the long-term effects of these products on health; doubts about the likely interest in and uptake of these products among existing smokers; concerns that increasing the availability of these products will increase the number of new tobacco users and eventually the number of smokers in the population; and anxiety about how the tobacco industry may use these products to undermine current tobacco control policies. This paper concludes with suggestions for a graduated series of policies that may allow exploration of the public health costs and benefits of encouraging smokers to switch to snus.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

This study used standard smoking machine tests to examine the extent to which the industry is introducing engineering features that reduce tar and nicotine to cigarettes sold in middle- and low-income countries. STUDY DESIGN: Multicountry observational study. METHODS: Cigarettes from 10 different countries were purchased in 2005 and 2007 with low-, middle- and high-income countries identified using the World Bank's per capita gross national income metric. Physical measurements of each brand were tested, and tobacco moisture and weight, paper porosity, filter ventilation and pressure drop were analysed. Tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide emission levels were determined for each brand using International Organization for Standardization and Canadian Intensive methods. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. RESULTS: Among cigarette brands with filters, more brands were ventilated in high-income countries compared with middle- and low-income countries [χ(2)(4)=25.92, P<0.001]. Low-income brands differed from high- and middle-income brands in engineering features such as filter density, ventilation and paper porosity, while tobacco weight and density measures separated the middle- and high-income groups. Smoke emissions differed across income groups, but these differences were largely negated when one accounted for design features. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that as a country's income level increases, cigarettes become more highly engineered and the emissions levels decrease. In order to reduce the burden of tobacco-related disease and further effective product regulation, health officials must understand cigarette design and function within and between countries.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

While ENDSs may facilitate harm reduction in smokers, they may represent risks to health and addiction in the nicotine naïve. Vape shops account for a substantial proportion of ENDS sales/distribution. STUDY DESIGN: Brief summary of the relevant literature. METHODS: This communication provides a brief summary of relevant literature derived from traditional tobacco retail and point-of-sale marketing and synthesizes issues regarding how the Food and Drug Administration regulation might impact the ENDS market, specifically the vape shop industry, a nuanced tobacco retail environment. RESULTS: This literature indicates that tobacco retailers are disproportionately located near vulnerable populations (e.g. the socio-economically disadvantaged, racial/ethnic minorities, and young adults) and may use stronger promotional activities to target these populations. Research extending this literature to ENDSs and ENDS retailers, such as vape shops, is limited. Regulatory efforts, spatial access, and exposure to marketing and advertising are macrolevel factors that have a significant impact on the individual-level tobacco use. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should examine multilevel factors (e.g. policies, community context, and marketing) and extend this literature to the ENDS market, particularly vape shops, which is especially relevant during the rapidly changing regulatory environment.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Learning from the diffusion of heated tobacco products in Spain.,"OBJECTIVES: Tobacco companies have introduced heated tobacco product (HTP) in many countries and marketed it on the grounds that it is a less harmful alternative to health. However, tobacco companies have been widely criticized for taking advantage of a loophole that allows electronic devices to circumvent regulations limiting tobacco advertising. This work aims to determine whether HTPs respected the rules that regulate tobacco advertising when it was introduced in Spain. STUDY DESIGN: This is an observational epidemiological study. METHODS: Using monthly time series data from September 2016 to June 2020, we analyzed whether the adoption of HTPs has followed the same behavior patterns as other brands that were introduced under the same conditions of use. The Bass model is used to analyze the diffusion of HTPs, and 30 other traditional cigarette brands introduced under the same conditions as this HTPs. RESULTS: The adoption of HTPs in Spain has been like that of brands of slim cigarettes that are mistakenly considered to be healthier than traditional cigarettes. The results indicate that the use of HTPs has spread in the same way as additive-free and ultra-slim cigarette brands. CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers should keep in mind that laws should restrict any marketing of tobacco products that promotes positive connotations between tobacco use and being healthy. If manufacturers are allowed to classify a category and/or brand of tobacco products as less harmful to health, the imitation effect is very high, leading to the proliferation of smoking.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study examined the impact of plain packaging and brand imagery on interest in trying e-cigarettes among youth. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental design. METHODS: Two online experiments were conducted in February 2020 as part of the ITC Youth Tobacco & Vaping Survey, conducted with 13,624 16- to 19-year-olds in Canada, England, and the USA. In the between-group Experiment 1, participants were randomized to view a set of 3 e-cigarette brands, in either their original external packaging ('branded' condition) or standardized olive-green packaging ('standardized' condition), and asked to select the product they would be most interested in trying. The within-group Experiment 2 examined brand imagery directly on devices, including potential differences in appeal among subgroups. Each participant viewed 4 pod-style e-cigarette devices: one 'plain' and 3 in colourful 'skins'. Logistic regression models were conducted to test the effect of condition, adjusting for demographics, smoking and vaping status. RESULTS: In Experiment 1, participants in the 'standardized' packaging condition were significantly more likely to indicate 'I have no interest in trying any of these products' (72.3%) than those in the 'branded' condition (66.9%, AOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.33-1.59). Experiment 2 results indicated differences in e-cigarette appeal by sex in the selection of male- and female-oriented designs, and by cannabis use for a Rastafarian-themed design. CONCLUSIONS: Brand imagery on e-cigarettes can target products to specific subgroups. Removal of imagery, in the form of standardized packaging, has the potential to reduce interest in trying e-cigarettes among young people.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Notably, the tobacco industry spends billions of dollars promoting products to consumers across various channels to attract and retain customers. This study aimed to examine the populations and settings that anti-tobacco messaging and tobacco advertising reach most frequently to inform future campaigns. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study using data from the 2022 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 6; N = 6252). METHODS: Weighted descriptive statistics assessed location of anti-tobacco messages or tobacco ads respondents reported seeing. Logistic regression models examined the odds of seeing anti-tobacco messages or tobacco advertising by smoking status, e-cigarette use, and demographics. RESULTS: While 40.5 % of HINTS respondents did not notice any anti-tobacco messages in the previous 3 months, the places respondents reported seeing them most frequently were television, billboards, stores, and social media. The places respondents most often noticed tobacco advertisements were stores, billboards, television, and print media, but 52.2 % reported they did not see any ads. There were lower odds of reporting seeing anti-tobacco messages among those aged 35-49 compared to those 18-34, and lower odds of seeing tobacco ads among those 65-74 and 75 or older. Those who smoked or used e-cigarettes had higher odds of reporting seeing anti-tobacco messages and tobacco ads. CONCLUSIONS: The places people were aware they saw tobacco ads and anti-tobacco messaging were similar, and younger adults and those who currently smoked or used e-cigarettes were more likely to report seeing both anti- and pro-tobacco messaging.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: In 2014 we conducted a survey of 3319 middle and high school students. RESULTS: Among the students, 56% had tried an electronic cigarette at least once (boys: 59.9%, girls: 49.3%; ranging from 31.3% for the 8th grade students to 66.1% for the 12th grades). However, only 3.4% reported that they used electronic cigarettes every day. Initiation of e-cigarette use in these teenagers was principally due to use by friends or triggered by curiosity and they usually choose fruit or sweet flavours initially. The majority could not give the concentration of nicotine in e-cigarettes that they used. Moreover, 61.5% of the students had ever tried tobacco and 22.3% were daily smokers. Our study found a strong link between vaping and smoking. 80% of the students who had ever tried conventional cigarettes (94% for the daily smokers) had also tried an electronic cigarette, versus 16% of the student who have never smoked. Few students (6.2%) used electronic cigarettes without smoking tobacco too. Usually, they have tried tobacco before trying an electronic cigarette. Only tobacco smokers seem to smoke electronic cigarettes with nicotine. CONCLUSION: Although our study shows that teenagers frequently try electronic cigarettes, it does not prove, for the moment, that vaping itself usually leads to nicotine addiction. However, as most of the teenagers are unable to tell if the electronic cigarette they are testing contains nicotine, it raises the possibility that they could be vulnerable to manipulation by the tobacco industry.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

An analysis of the scientific literature was conducted in order to enlighten professionals and decision-makers. METHOD: After a Medline query in February 2018, a systematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Of the 100 papers published in 2008-2018, 75 have authors affiliated or linked to TI. Emissions contain gases, droplets and solid particles, so are smokes. The main products are: THS2.2 (Iqos®) which heats mini-cigarettes at 340°C, the THP1.0 (Glo®) which heats at 240°C sticks delivering about half as much nicotine, Ploom® which uses reconstituted tobacco microcapsules heated at 180°C. Under the experimental conditions, there is a reduction of toxic emissions and biological effects, but the expected risk reduction is not demonstrated. Symptoms related to passive smoking are described. The 4 epidemiological articles report that heated tobacco is used in 10 to 45% of cases by non-smokers and demonstrate the effectiveness of TI promotion campaigns. Thus, the THS2.2 is more a gateway to smoking (20%) than an exit door (11%); moreover, it is not expected risk reduction among the 69% who are mixed users. CONCLUSIONS: While reducing emissions is documented, reducing the risk to the smoker who switches to heated-tobacco remains to be demonstrated. On the other hand, the worsening of the global tobacco risk related to the promotion of the products by the TI is anticipated, justifying that the authorities take the appropriate measures to control the promotion of heated tobacco.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Social scientists created and disseminated non-health based, pro-tobacco arguments without fully acknowledging their relationship with the industry. After the US Surgeon General concluded that nicotine was addictive in 1988, the industry responded by forming ""Associates for Research in the Science of Enjoyment"" (c.1988-1999), whose members toured the world promoting the health benefits of the use of legal substances, including tobacco, for stress relief and relaxation, without acknowledging the industry's role. In this paper we draw on previously secret tobacco industry documents, now available on the Internet to show how both of these programs utilized academic sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, psychologists, philosophers and economists, and allowed the industry to develop and widely disseminate friendly research through credible channels. Strategies included creating favorable surveys and opinions, infusing them into the lay press and media through press releases, articles and conferences, publishing, promoting and disseminating books, commissioning and placing favorable book reviews, providing media training for book authors and organizing media tours.

METHODS: Thirteen focus groups (N = 84) were stratified by education (seven < Bachelor's degree, six ≥ Bachelor's degree) and race (eight black, five white). Participants viewed a 1-min video describing the discovery of a genetic variant associated with increased risk of nicotine addiction and lung cancer. Next, they provided their opinions about the information. Two coders analyzed the data using grounded theory. RESULTS: Pre-video knowledge about why people smoke cigarettes and what genetic risk means informed beliefs about the relationship between genes and addiction. These beliefs were not always consistent with biomedical explanations, but formed the context through which participants processed the video's information. This, in turn, led to information acceptance or skepticism. Participants explained their reactions in terms of the scientific merits of the research and used their existing knowledge and beliefs to explain their acceptance of or skepticism about the information. CONCLUSION: Laypeople hold complex understandings of genetics and addiction.

We sought to understand e-cigarette users' experiences with uncontrolled vaping and how they restrain their vaping. METHODS: Participants were 24 US adult e-cigarette users recruited in 2021. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews about uncontrolled vaping and restraint strategies and analyzed findings based on behavioral categories described in the Process Model of Self-Control. RESULTS: While most participants (21 of 24) described experiences of uncontrolled vaping, some expressed ambivalence about how much they vaped. To restrain vaping, willpower was rarely used and was not perceived as effective. Distraction, deployment of attention away from the urge to vape, and reappraisal, thinking differently about vaping such as reminding oneself of health consequences, were common and helped some participants limit use in the moment of wanting to vape. Participants described using both situation selection, choosing to be in situations where e-cigarette use was less possible, and situation modification, modifying their circumstances to restrict opportunities to vape. DISCUSSION: Uncontrolled vaping is not yet a well-defined concept for many e-cigarette users. E-cigarette users employed proactive situational strategies that required planning ahead to restrain use and found these strategies more effective compared to reactive strategies. Tobacco control programs and interventions should consider leveraging restraint strategies that people who vape are naturally using and perceive to be effective.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

At the same time, their exclusion from policy-making processes curtails their ability to oppose further regulation of their business. Trans-national tobacco companies (TTCs) claim that their investment in electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDs) present a viable alternative business model to the sale of combustible cigarettes. However, many public health actors argue that entry into the ENDS market is being used by TTCs to shape the development of this product category, influence tobacco control debates and re-engage policy-makers in ways precluded by the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The appearance by four tobacco company executives before the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee enquiry into electronic cigarettes is an important example of how the tobacco industry is 'healthwashing' its reputation through ENDs investments and is being invited back into policy spaces from which it had been previously excluded. This article employs rhetorical theory to conduct a micro-level analysis of the tobacco industry's policy influencing strategy. It examines not just the ways in which TTC actors frame the ENDs product category, tobacco control policy and their role within this, but the rhetorical appeals, forms of language and discursive strategies used to engage and persuade their audience. In so doing, it contributes to the growing literature on the commercial determinants of health and previous macro-level framing analyses of these industries. Finally, it sets out a methodology for similar analyses of TTC rhetoric in other contexts, of other health-harming industries, and comparative analyses between industries.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We investigated the levels of trust that consumers place in different information sources and how trust is associated with cultural worldviews, risk perceptions, ENDS use, and sociodemographic characteristics using a nationally representative sample of 6051 U.S. adults in 2015. Seventeen percent of adults were uncertain about their trust for one or more potential sources. Among the rest, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), health experts, and the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) elicited the highest levels of trust. In contrast, tobacco and vapor manufacturers, vape shop employees, and, to a lesser extent, the news media were distrusted. Adults who had higher incomes and more education or espoused egalitarian and communitarian worldviews expressed more trust in health sources and the FDA, whereas those identifying as non-Hispanic Black or multiracial reported less trust. Current smokers, those who identified as non-Hispanic Black or other race, had lower incomes, and espoused hierarchy and individualism worldviews expressed less distrust toward the tobacco and vapor industry. Greater trust (or less distrust) toward the tobacco and vapor industry and an individualism worldview were associated with perceptions of lower risk of premature death from daily ENDS use, greater uncertainty about those risks, and greater odds of using ENDS. Public health and the FDA should consider consumer trust and worldviews in the design and regulation of public education campaigns regarding the potential health risks and benefits of ENDS.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Cultured human dermal fibroblasts were exposed to smokeless tobacco extract (STE), total particulate matter (TPM) from tobacco smoke, or nicotine at concentrations comparable to those found in these extracts for 1h or 5h. Differences were identified in pathway-specific genes between treatments and vehicle using qRT-PCR. At 1h, IL1α was suppressed significantly by TPM and less significantly by STE. Neither FOS nor JUN was suppressed at 1h by tobacco products. IL8, TNFα, VCAM1, and NFκB1 were suppressed after 5h with STE, whereas only TNFα and NFκB1 were suppressed by TPM. At 1h with TPM, secreted levels of IL10 and TNFα were increased. Potentially confounding effects of nicotine were exemplified by genes such as ATF3 (5h), which was increased by nicotine but suppressed by other components of STE. Within 2h, TPM stimulated nitric oxide production, and both STE and TPM increased reactive oxygen species. The biological significance of these findings and utilization of the gene expression changes reported herein regarding effects of the tobacco product preparations on dermal fibroblasts will require additional research.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The neutral red uptake (NRU) assay is one of these assays and is routinely used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and tobacco industries. In the context of e-cigarette development, an NRU assay-based screen was implemented to evaluate the cytotoxic potential of e-liquids. E-liquids induced a biphasic response in the BALB/c 3T3-based assay. The NRU initially increased in a concentration-dependent manner before decreasing following treatment with higher concentrations until NRU was abolished. Experiments were performed to characterize the mechanism underlying this biphasic signal. Nicotine alone was found to induce the same biphasic effects, while inducing concentration-dependent decreases in relative cell counts (RCC). Imaging and flow cytometry data revealed that the increases in NRU likely resulted from nicotine-induced vacuolization via a lysosomotropic mechanism. In support of this, two lysosomotropic agents, chloroquine and lapatinib, induced similar profiles. Nicotine's effects were also translatable, as brain-, lung-, bone marrow-, and smooth muscle-derived mammalian cells responded with the biphasic NRU signal. However, like RCC, three other cytotoxicity endpoints, resazurin, adenosine triphosphate, and water soluble tetrazolium salt (WST)-8, were not subject to these effects. The WST-8 assay is proposed as an alternative to screen the cytotoxic potential of e-liquids.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Philip Morris International'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

These products have been proposed as non-combustible alternatives to traditional tobacco products such as cigarettes and may thus reduce the negative health consequences associated with tobacco smoke. However, the overall health impact and safety of using these products remains unclear. This review seeks to provide an updated summary of available evidence on changes to levels of tobacco-related biomarkers to aid the overall assessment of the consequences of using e-cigarettes and HTPs. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted through major databases (Medline/PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE) searching for articles directly comparing biomarker levels in humans using e-cigarettes or HTPs and those using combustible cigarettes. We included peer reviewed articles with comparative or longitudinal design and extracted key information for our purpose (type of population, demographics, biomarkers measurements, and health effects). An initial qualitative analysis was performed followed by a summary of findings. RESULTS: A total of 44 studies were included from initial citations. The vast majority of the literature reported reductions in levels of biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure (BOE), especially nicotine, MHBMA, 3-HPMA, S-PMA, 1-OHP and NNAL, when using e-cigarettes and HTPs compared to combustible cigarettes. There was a slight tendency toward a larger reduction in these biomarkers levels with the use of e-cigarettes, although direct comparisons between e-cigarettes and HTPs were lacking. There was also a trend toward positive changes in levels of biomarkers of biological effect (BOBE) with the use of e-cigarettes and HTPs. CONCLUSIONS: A comparison of levels of biomarkers of tobacco-related exposure collected in clinical studies revealed that the use of e-cigarettes and HTPs could lead to a significant reduction in exposure to harmful substances compared to combusted cigarettes. In tandem, the health status of e-cigarettes and HTP users, indexed by levels of biomarkers of biological effect showed potential for improvement compared to smoking. However, larger and longer-term population-based studies are needed to further clarify these findings.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

An assessment of two Vitrocell® Mammalian 6/48 exposure modules in three independent experiments was made by comparing results from multiple dosimetric techniques applied to aerosol generated from 3R4F Kentucky Reference cigarettes, commercially available electronically heated tobacco product (eHTP) and Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) using the Vitrocell® VC10®. Real-time aerosol particle concentration was assessed by means of light scattering photometers and expressed as area under the curve (∑AUC). Nicotine concentrations were determined analytically by LC/MS. Humectant amount and distribution was assessed for eHTP and ENDS by the quantification of free glycerol in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) trap, whereas total particulate matter (TPM) was assessed in the 3R4F cigarettes by the fluorescence of the particulate at 485 nm in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) trap within the exposure. Dose was adjusted by means of the addition of ambient air to dilute the whole smoke/aerosol in L/min and sampled into the system at a rate of 5 mL/min. Dilution of CS ranged from 8.0 to 0.5 L/min and for the eHTP and ENDS ranged from 4 to 0 L/min (undiluted). Dosimetric analysis of the system showed good concordance within replicates (p-values ranged from p = 0.3762 to p = 0.8926) and showed that the Vitrocell® Mammalian 6/48 is a viable means for genotoxic assessment of aerosol generated from both conventional cigarettes and NGTP. Results demonstrate the need to tailor dosimetry approaches to different aerosols due to variations in the physio-chemical composition, with a multi-dosimetry approach recommended.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,"['Generic tobacco/vape industry', 'R.J.

Use of ST as a smoking cessation method or as a means to reduce cigarettes has been proposed. The impact of using ST in these ways is relatively unknown. METHODS: A review of the different issues and studies related to using smokeless tobacco as a method to reduce tobacco toxin exposure and harm is presented. RESULTS: The toxicity of the product itself varies by brand of ST and across countries. Of the existing studies, comparisons of consequences between cigarettes and ST show that cigarette smoking produces more negative health effects, is likely to have a higher addiction potential and more severe withdrawal, and leads to a higher rate of relapse than ST use. On the other hand, ST use facilitates the use of cigarettes, which is a deadly tobacco product. Additionally, ST is not a harmless product, and a less harmful product, medicinal nicotine, is available as an effective treatment approach. Furthermore, ST products are not under the same regulatory scrutiny as medicinal nicotine products. CONCLUSIONS: Considerably more research and product regulation is necessary prior to considering smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction method.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Menthol, in low concentrations can also stimulate these same cold receptors causing a depressive effect on respiratory activity. Menthol cigarettes when smoked, deliver enough menthol to stimulate cold receptors resulting in the smoker experiencing a ""cool sensation."" The ""cool sensation"" experienced by the menthol smoker can result in a reflex-depressive effect on respiratory activity. METHOD: Literature searches were done for the NLM databases (e.g., MEDLINE from 1966, TOXLINE, OLDMEDLINE (1985-1965), CANCERLIT, plus tobacco industry documents and hardcopy indices. The evidence was evaluated with application to mentholated cigarette smoking. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A logical progression is presented that develops the framework to prove that menthol found in mentholated cigarettes may cause respiratory depression resulting in greater exposure to the toxic substances found in tobacco smoke. CONCLUSION: As a result of breath holding that results from the stimulation of cold receptors there is a greater opportunity for exposure and transfer of the contents of the lungs to the pulmonary circulation. For the menthol smoker this results in a greater exposure to nicotine and the particulate matter (tar) of the smoked cigarette. This exposure can result in increased nicotine dependence and greater chance of tobacco-attributable disease.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Although nicotine may have some harmful effects, the detrimental health effects of smoked tobacco are primarily due to non-nicotine constituents. Hence, the health effects of nicotine reduction would likely be determined by changes in behavior that result in changes in smoke exposure. METHODS: Herein, we review the current evidence on nicotine reduction and discuss some of the challenges in establishing the empirical basis for regulatory decisions. RESULTS: To date, research suggests that very low nicotine content cigarettes produce a desirable set of outcomes, including reduced exposure to nicotine, reduced smoking, and reduced dependence, without significant safety concerns. However, much is still unknown, including the effects of gradual versus abrupt changes in nicotine content, effects in vulnerable populations, and impact on youth. DISCUSSION: A coordinated effort must be made to provide the best possible scientific basis for regulatory decisions. The outcome of this effort may provide the foundation for a novel approach to tobacco control that dramatically reduces the devastating health consequences of smoked tobacco.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Product standards that reduce the addictiveness of cigarettes are now possible both in the U.S. and in countries party to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Specifically, standards that required substantially reduced nicotine content in cigarettes could enable cessation in smokers and prevent future smoking among current non-smokers. Behavioral economics uses principles from the field of microeconomics to characterize how consumption of a reinforcer changes as a function of the unit price of that reinforcer (unit price=cost/reinforcer magnitude). A nicotine reduction policy might be considered an increase in the unit price of nicotine because smokers are paying more per unit of nicotine. This perspective allows principles from behavioral economics to be applied to nicotine reduction research questions, including how nicotine consumption, smoking behavior, use of other tobacco products, and use of other drugs of abuse are likely to be affected. This paper reviews the utility of this approach and evaluates the notion that a reduction in nicotine content is equivalent to a reduction in the reinforcement value of smoking-an assumption made by the unit price approach.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The premature death and disease caused by tobacco can be considered largely as a side-effect of tobacco use behavior and the disease of addiction. The spread of that disease was fostered by an industry that researched the behavioral and biological basis of tobacco use and addiction and applied its findings and knowledge to develop products and marketing approaches to increase the likelihood that people, especially young people, would try tobacco products and develop persistent use and addiction. Researchers outside of the tobacco industry also investigated the behavioral biology of tobacco use and their research has been critical in turning the tide of the tobacco and disease epidemic. The behavioral factors are considered vital to understand and address by United States Food and Drug Administration and Surgeon General, as well as the World Health Organization in their tobacco control efforts. This commentary discusses key behavioral factors in the rise and fall of the epidemic, as well as some of those increasingly discussed as potential contributors to the endgame.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Furthermore, the sexual minority population is diverse and little research exists to determine whether subgroups, such as lesbians, gay men, and female and male bisexuals, differ on smoker characteristics. We examine differences in smoking characteristics (advertising receptivity, age of first cigarette, non-daily smoking, cigarettes per day, nicotine dependence, desire to quit and past quit attempts) among lesbians, gay men, and female and male bisexual adults in the United States. METHODS: Secondary analysis of the CDC's (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) 2009-2010 National Adult Tobacco Survey (N=118,590). RESULTS: Controlling for age, race, socioeconomic status and geographic region, identifying as a female bisexual was associated with fewer past quit attempts, lower age at first cigarette, and higher nicotine dependence when compared to heterosexual women. There were no differences in desire to quit between male or female sexual minorities and their heterosexual counterparts. CONCLUSION: Sexual minority individuals smoke at higher rates than heterosexuals and yet similarly desire to quit.

The Food and Drug Administration has the authority to regulate tobacco production (2009 Tobacco Control Act) but fails to ban menthol and reduce cigarettes nicotine content. As little has changed, the Healthy People 2010 objective of reducing the prevalence of cigarette smoking among adults to 12% by 2010 in the US will be attained by 2030. The monitoring of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is passive, even when governments repeatedly violate the Article 5.3 of the Convention, which specifically requires protecting public policy from tobacco industry interference. Since 2004, the year after the adoption of the Convention, the prevalence of daily smoking has leveled off and the 2012 annualized rate of change in prevalence of daily smoking was almost null. This contrasts with a 2% annual decrease in the prevalence of daily smoking from 1980 to 2004. The tobacco endgame needs acts, not bureaucracies.

The Pisinger and Dossing review included 76 studies and considered 26 (34%) to be 'funded or otherwise supported' by the industry. As the review identifies the 'conflicted' studies, such a claim can be checked. In summary, only 10 (13%) of articles covered by the review were sponsored by the industry and only 5 are published studies. Claim 'A' is misleading. Regarding claim 'B', it appears to have been conceived independent of any empirical support. Recently, anti-EC activists and media started to use conflict of interest accusations to disparage the validity of empirical evidence showing that vaping is much safer than smoking.

PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science were searched for performance effects of VLNC cigarettes. For inclusion, reports had to be in English, published in a peer-reviewed journal through June 2017, examine VLNC cigarettes (<0.2mg nicotine yield), include ≥2hour smoking abstinence or reduced nicotine exposure, and examine performance. 19 of 1243 articles reviewed met inclusion criteria. Poorer performance after smoking VLNC versus normal nicotine content (NNC) cigarettes was observed across 7 of 10 domains, including reaction time (8/11), short-term memory (3/10), sustained attention (4/6), inhibitory control (1/4), long-term memory (3/3 studies), and response variability (2/2). In two studies, combining VLNC smoking with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) resulted in performance that was comparable to performance after NNC smoking. VLNC versus NNC differences were not discerned in motor control/functioning (0/2), visuospatial processing (0/2), learning (0/1), or verbal fluency (0/1). Eleven of nineteen (58%) studies were rated of Good or Excellent quality. Overall, VLNC cigarettes may not fully ameliorate withdrawal-induced disruptions in performance, although this varies by domain, with the strongest evidence for reaction time. Importantly, combining VLNC cigarettes with NRT appears to ameliorate withdrawal that is not reduced by VLNC cigarettes alone. As only 19 studies were identified, many domains are under-investigated. A more thorough evaluation of the extent to which VLNC cigarettes affect withdrawal-impaired performance may be warranted.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Also, it is delaying for several years a key regulation affecting cigars and e-cigarettes, including flavored vaping products that tend to appeal to younger consumers. Specifically, it postponed the requirement that such products be approved by the agency. Both actions are part of a comprehensive plan to eventually wean smokers off conventional cigarettes and steer them toward less harmful alternative forms of nicotine. With its new approach to the fight against smoking, the FDA has unquestionably made great strides toward more effectively addressing the prevalence of related deaths and diseases in the U.S. However, much important work must be undertaken before this ultimate goal can be accomplished. For instance, further research into long-term effects of e-cigarettes must be conducted before these products can truly be seen as safer alternatives to combustible cigarettes. Additionally, public education is necessary to inform smokers about the range of tobacco products available and the actual harms associated with their use. Finally, the agency might have to work alongside the powerful tobacco industry to minimize potential legal challenges and to convince businesses that a shift to low-nicotine products and e-cigarettes is best for their future success and for the health of the American citizenry.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Nicotine reduction and non-combusted alternatives - Two strategies for reducing smoking and improving public health.,"Combustible cigarettes remain the most harmful and addictive tobacco product, and reducing the prevalence of smoking continues to be a critical public health goal. While nicotine is the constituent primarily responsible for addiction to cigarettes, most of the harm associated with smoking comes from byproducts of tobacco combustion. Recently, two different approaches for reducing the harms of smoking have emerged, both of which focus on breaking the link between the addiction to nicotine and the harms caused by smoking. First, the addictive potential of cigarettes could be minimized by requiring a large reduction in the nicotine content of cigarettes. Evidence for a nicotine reduction policy thus far shows that the use of very low nicotine content cigarettes results in a reduction in the number of cigarettes people smoke per day and a reduction in cigarette dependence. Second, emerging alternative nicotine delivery systems (ANDS) like electronic cigarettes may provide sufficient nicotine to act as substitutes for cigarettes while delivering much lower levels of toxicants. Evidence suggests that the emergence of ANDS has increased the percentage of smokers who are able to quit. The present paper will briefly review the evidence for each of these approaches, and consider what contemporary reinforcement and addiction theories can tell us about their likely success. We argue that the most effective endgame approach is one that pursues both nicotine reduction and alternative nicotine delivery systems as complementary.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

This study examines how differences in e-cigarette advertising regulations influence exposure to e-cigarette advertising, and perceptions about what participants had seen and read about e-cigarettes. Data come from the ITC Four Country Survey (Canada [CA], United States [US], Australia [AU] and United Kingdom [UK]) carried out between August 2013 and March 2015 (n = 3460). In 2014, AU and CA had laws prohibiting the retail sale of e-cigarettes containing nicotine while the US and UK had no restrictions, although a voluntary agreement restricting advertising in the UK was introduced during fieldwork. Smokers and ex-smokers were asked whether in the last six months they had noticed e-cigarettes advertisements and received free samples/special offers (promotion), and about their perceptions (positive or otherwise) of what they had seen or read about e-cigarettes. Data were analyzed in 2017. US and UK participants were more likely to report that they had noticed e-cigarette advertisements and received promotions compared to CA or AU participants. For TV and radio advertisements, reported exposure was higher in US compared to UK. For all types of advertisements, reported exposure was higher in CA than AU. Overall, nearly half of AU (44.0%) and UK (47.8%) participants perceived everything they had seen and read about e-cigarettes to be positive, with no significant differences between AU and UK. Participants in countries with permissive e-cigarette advertising restrictions and less restrictive e-cigarette regulations were more likely to notice advertisements than participants in countries with more restrictive e-cigarette regulations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,No,

All three dimensions of COI showed the same tendency: studies with industry-related COI found potential harm significantly less often than studies without a COI. 95.1% of papers without and 39.4% of papers with a COI found potential harmful effects/substances. Only 7.7% of tobacco industry-related studies found potential harm. The odds of finding of no harm were significantly higher in studies with an industry-related COI (OR 66.92 (95% CI 8.1-552.9)) than in studies without a COI. A strong/moderate COI was associated with very high odds (OR 91.50 (95% CI 10.9-771.4)) of finding of no harm compared with studies with no/weak COI. This blinded assessment showed that almost all papers without a COI found potentially harmful effects of e-cigarettes. There was a strong association between industry-related COI and tobacco- and e-cigarette industry-favourable results, indicating that e-cigarettes are harmless.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Using photographs of storefront tobacco ads in New York City (NYC), we conducted a content analysis to describe the prevalence of common features across four product categories and illuminate ways in which they may influence behavior. In 2017, data collectors photographed exterior ads from a representative sample of tobacco retailers in NYC (n = 796). We coded each ad (n = 976) for the presence of various characteristics (e.g., brand, price displays, warning labels, menthol/flavors, size, location). Chi-square tests examined differences by product type. Most ads were for cigarettes (40%), followed by electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS, 27.9%), cigars (26.9%), and smokeless tobacco (5.2%). Over half of cigarette and smokeless tobacco ads promoted a menthol or flavored style (61% each), compared to about a quarter of cigar (25.9%) and ENDS ads (30.3%, p < .0001). Cigar and ENDS ads, however, were more frequently placed directly on the door of entry (49.4% and 46.7%, respectively, p < .001). Only 5% of ENDS ads displayed a standard warning label. Notably, a quarter of all tobacco ads (23.4%) were for the brand Newport. Cigarette ads still dominate at the point-of-sale with regard to volume and size. Across all products, ad features did not always align with local and federal policies (e.g., flavor bans, warning label mandates). Continued surveillance of advertising strategies and policy compliance can help provide the evidence base needed to inform marketing regulations that reduce the deadly burden of tobacco use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Overall, 22% and 32% of smokers received tobacco coupons via email and mail, respectively, and 22% redeemed cigarette coupons. White, 25-44 year old, female, sexual minority, and more nicotine dependent smokers were more likely to receive coupons via both channels and to redeem coupons, as were smokers with mid-levels education (GED to associate degree) and those unable to pay important bills (OR email receipt = 1.37, 95% CI 1.22-1.54; OR mail receipt = 1.38, 95% CI 1.24-1.55; and OR coupon redemption = 1.44, 95% CI 1.26-1.64).

Major demographic and socioeconomic disparities exist in receipt and redemption of direct email\mail tobacco coupons among US smokers. Cigarette coupons received via direct mail are more likely to be redeemed than coupons received via email.

This analysis included adults aged 18 years and older in the United States (N = 4229). Both rural and urban respondents reported a similar history of e-cigarette use. Rural respondents were significantly more likely than urban respondents to trust religious organizations and leaders and tobacco companies for information about e-cigarettes. Rural and urban respondents were equally as likely to believe e-cigarettes are addictive, perceive e-cigarette use as harmful, and believe e-cigarettes are more harmful than tobacco cigarettes. Respondents were equally as likely to look for information on e-cigarettes, the health effects of e-cigarettes, and cessation; and, to seek e-cigarette information from healthcare professionals, family and friends, and health organizations and groups. Given our findings, it will be pertinent to continue to research the potential harms of e-cigarette use and develop accurate health communication messages to avoid rural-urban disparities observed for cigarette smoking-related outcomes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This analysis also examines the relationship between free tobacco product receipt and ever, past 30-day, and new tobacco use one year later. The prevalence of free sample receipt in the US population in 2014-2016 was 0.8% for any tobacco product but 1.6% for ENDS/e-liquid in adults, and 0.5% for any tobacco product but 1.05% for ENDS/e-liquid in youth.

Receipt of free tobacco product samples was associated with tobacco use status using cross-sectional data in youth and adults, as well as one year later in youth. Receipt of a free ENDS or e-liquid sample was associated with any tobacco and ENDS use status using cross-sectional data in youth and adults. After these data were collected, the US Food and Drug Administration broadened the ban on distributing free samples to include all tobacco products except smokeless tobacco in adult-only facilities.

Tobacco harm reduction involves providing tobacco users who are unwilling or unable to quit using nicotine products with less harmful nicotine-containing products for continued use. The skepticism towards harm reduction is based in part on the experience with low-yield tar/nicotine cigarettes, which were presumed to be associated with lower health risks than higher yield cigarettes and marketed as such by cigarette manufacturers. Only later did the field learn that these cigarettes were a deceptive way for cigarette manufacturers to allay the health concerns over cigarette smoking. Since this experience, there has been a proliferation of tobacco products that might potentially serve as a means to reduce tobacco harm. Some members of the tobacco control community believe that these products have great potential to reduce mortality and morbidity among smokers who completely switch to them. Others believe that we will be addicting another generation to tobacco products.

Many of the missed opportunities identified are due to the actions of cigarette manufacturers who misled the public about the dangers of cigarette smoking, the addictiveness of nicotine, and the feasibility of providing lower risk alternative nicotine delivery products to addicted smokers. An important lesson learned from the past is that treating all tobacco/nicotine products as equivalently harmful is counterproductive to public health as it only serves to protect the most lethal nicotine product - cigarettes. Since 2000, the evolving marketplace of lower risk nicotine products combined with regulatory authority over tobacco products represents a new opportunity to dramatically transform the cigarette business in ways that were never imagined when the war on tobacco was raging decades ago. However, this requires embracing risk-proportionate regulation, taxation policies, and providing consumers with accurate public messaging on product relative risks. A regulatory framework based on sound science that encourages and rewards new or existing manufacturers to invest in consumer acceptable lower risk products to replace cigarettes needs to be encouraged. The past is indeed not the future in smoking control, but it may be difficult to escape the past unless a realignment of market forces and policies can be achieved.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We examined tobacco use and susceptibility to use by sexual identity in adolescents. Data were collected in February 2019 via Qualtrics research participant panels. Data analyses were performed in June 2019 and updated in October 2020. Respondents aged 13-17 reported sexual identity (heterosexual vs. sexual minority [lesbian, gay, bisexual, or other]), past-month and lifetime tobacco product use, susceptibility to e-cigarette use, friend(s)' e-cigarette use, tobacco marketing exposure, and demographic characteristics. The sample (n=983) was 72.9% female, 46.5% non-Hispanic white, and 26.1% sexual minority with a mean age of 15.0 years (SD=1.4). Sexual minority adolescents were more likely to have friend(s) who vape (53.0% versus 42.0%; p=0.003). In adjusted models, sexual minority adolescents had greater odds of ever smoking tobacco (odds ratio [OR]=2.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42-2.98) or using e-cigarettes (OR=1.55; 95% CI: 1.08-2.25) relative to heterosexual adolescents. Past-month tobacco smoking and e-cigarette use did not differ by sexual identity. Among participants who had never used tobacco products, sexual minority adolescents reported greater susceptibility to e-cigarette use (OR=1.62; 95% CI: 1.04-2.52) compared to heterosexual adolescents. Exposure to cigarette and e-cigarette marketing, e-cigarette use by friends, and respondent sex were significant covariates in all models. The current findings indicate greater susceptibility to use e-cigarettes and greater tobacco product initiation, but not continuation, among sexual minority adolescents. Sexual minority-tailored interventions may be warranted to prevent tobacco product initiation.

We examined marketing activities related to novel tobacco products (e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products) during this restriction. Using web scraping, we accessed data for 2661 e-cigarette liquids marketed online by South African vendors in June 2020. We also analyzed heated tobacco product volume sales (kits) using retail scanner data from Nielsen Company. The 2661 e-cigarette liquids assessed online comprised cannabidiol liquids, 28.8%[767/2661], nicotine salts, 10.4%[276/2661], e-cigarette juice concentrates, 14.1%[376/2661], nicotine-free e-liquid, 4.0%[107/2661], and nicotine-containing e-liquid, 42.6%[1135/2661]. Cannabidiol liquids had the highest percentage of fruit (78.4%[601/767]) and tobacco flavors (9.4%[72/767]). During the restriction, many online e-cigarette vendors actively promoted cannabidiol liquid in lieu of regular e-liquid. Nielsen retail scanner data showed that volume of heated tobacco product sales in February 2020, preceding the restriction (7.76 million kits), were higher than in February 2019 (4.52 million kits). The restriction saw decreased sales of heated tobacco products; mean weekly heated tobacco product sales in the 6 weeks following the restriction (772,585 kits/week) were dramatically lower versus the 6 weeks preceding the restriction (2.26 million kits/week). Lifting the restriction saw a 131% spike in sales between the latter half of August 2020 (825,638 kits) and mid-September 2020 sales (1.90 million kits), even though total sales in September 2020 were half of what was observed in the preceding year (3.81 million units in September 2020, vs 6.33 million units, September 2019).

Findings from the International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey.,"As governments consider policy action to reduce smoking, a key factor in creating political will is the level of public support, particularly among smokers who are most affected by the policies. The goal of this paper is to assess and compare the level of support in Canada, the United States, England, and Australia for five smoking control policies: 1) banning menthol in cigarettes, 2) banning cigarette additives, 3) reducing nicotine in cigarettes to make them less addictive, 4) raising the minimum age to purchase cigarettes to 21 years and older, and 5) requiring pictorial warning labels on cigarette packs (examined in the US only). Data for these analyses come from 8165 daily cigarette smokers who responded to the 2016 International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey. In all countries, the highest level of support was for raising the legal age for purchase to 21 years and older (62-70%) and reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes to make them less addictive (57-70%). Smokers who were less dependent on cigarettes and those expressing interest in quitting were more likely to support all policies. When asked how they would respond to a nicotine reduction policy, the most common response given was to try the non-nicotine cigarettes to see how they liked them (42-48%), with the next most common response being to quit smoking entirely (16-24%). The high level of support for these proposed policies among daily smokers provides important evidence for policymakers to counteract claims that such policies would be unpopular.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

In weighing whether to establish this standard, it is important to consider potential responses among people who are at elevated risk for tobacco-related health harms. In this narrative review, we summarize studies of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes conducted between 2010 and 2021 in groups that the FDA has identified as vulnerable populations. Studies conducted to date in adults with mental health conditions, adults with opioid use disorder, socioeconomically-disadvantaged adults, and youth or young adults indicate that immediate switching to VLNC cigarettes decreases smoking, with minimal or no unintended negative consequences. Few studies have investigated the effects of VLNC cigarettes in racial or ethnic minorities, people who smoke menthol cigarettes, and pregnant women, but initial findings suggest that responses of these individuals are similar to responses observed in other vulnerable populations. We are not aware of studies that have investigated VLNC cigarettes in military/veteran populations, sexual or gender minority individuals, or people living in underserved rural environments. Future research directions include understanding how to promote cessation in the context of a reduced-nicotine standard, and how to correct VLNC misperceptions in vulnerable populations. Nevertheless, the evidence to date indicates that a reduced-nicotine standard is likely to have the same beneficial effects on smoking reductions as it does in less vulnerable populations, which should provide some confidence in pursuing this regulatory approach.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

A large clinical trial compared the two approaches. This secondary analysis assesses abstinence and cessation-related outcomes one month after the trial concluded, when participants no longer had access to very low nicotine content (VLNC) research cigarettes. Smokers not interested in quitting (N = 1250) were recruited for the parent trial from 2014 to 2016 across 10 sites throughout the US and randomized to a 20-week study period during which they immediately switched to VLNC cigarettes, gradually transitioned to VLNC cigarettes with five monthly dose reductions, or smoked normal nicotine research cigarettes (control). At the one-month follow-up, both immediate and gradual reduction resulted in greater mean cigarette-free days (4.7 and 4.6 respectively) than the control group (3.2, both p < .05). Immediate reduction resulted in fewer mean cigarettes per day (CPD = 10.3) and lower Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD = 3.7) than the gradual (CPD = 11.7, p = .001; FTCD = 3.8, p = .039) and control (CPD = 13.5, p < .001; FTCD = 4.0, p < .001) groups. Compared to controls, gradual reduction resulted in reduced CPD (p = .012) but not FTCD (p = .13). Differences in CO-verified 7-day point-prevalence abstinence were not significant. Findings demonstrate that switching to VLNC cigarettes resulted in reduced smoking and nicotine dependence severity that was sustained for at least a month after the VLNC trial period in smokers who were not interested in cessation.

This study examined to what extent youth e-cigarette marketing exposure was associated with e-cigarette use behavior change one year later, during a time when youth e-cigarette use was starting to surge in the U.S. Using nationally representative longitudinal public-use data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, we examined associations between recalled e-cigarette marketing exposure (2016-2018) at Wave (W) 4 and e-cigarette use harm perception and behavior change (ever, current, and regular use) one year later (W4.5; 2017-2018) among W4 never tobacco users (n = 9405). Recall of exposure to e-cigarette marketing through different channels was also examined in multivariable models controlling for socio-demographic factors and established e-cigarette use risk factors. Results show that the most frequently recalled channels of e-cigarette marketing exposure were retail stores (50.3%), television (22.2%), and websites/social media (20.2%). Over one year, 21.2%, 7.8%, 3.4%, and 1.2% of respondents reported reduced harm perceptions, and ever, current, and regular use of e-cigarettes, respectively, at follow-up. Recalled exposure to e-cigarette marketing was associated with reduced e-cigarette harm perception (AOR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.05-1.37) and ever (AOR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.01-1.56) and current use (AOR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.02-1.92) at follow-up. E-cigarette marketing exposure through websites/social media was associated with reduced harm perceptions and all stages of e-cigarette use change, including regular use. Identifying marketing techniques and channels that change youth e-cigarette harm perceptions and influence e-cigarette use progression is essential to inform e-cigarette regulatory policies and prevention campaigns.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

However, little is known about factors associated with e-cigarette use in pregnant women and birth outcomes. In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the influence of several factors on behavioral changes in e-cigarette use before and during pregnancy, and assessed the association between e-cigarette use and subsequent birth outcomes among pregnant women. The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study, a government-sponsored national longitudinal study based in the US, Waves 1 through 4 (2013-2018) were used. Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to estimate behavioral changes in e-cigarette use during pregnancy and subsequent influence on high-risk birth (e.g., preterm birth, low birth weight, birth defects, etc.) and fetal death. Although pregnant women who quit vaping before pregnancy (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.54-2.40) or had any use during pregnancy (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.38-3.73) showed non-differential risk of having a high-risk birth in comparison to women who did not initiate vaping, we observed that the usage of mint/menthol flavor was correlated with higher risk of fetus death (OR = 3.27, 95% CI 1.17-9.19).

We extended this research by evaluating whether these associations were moderated by socio-demographic factors and medical comorbidities. This retrospective cohort study of 1,885,826 adults with current or never-smoking status in Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 3/5/2020 (baseline) to 12/31/2020 (pre-vaccine) included electronic health record-based socio-demographics (sex, age, race/ethnicity, neighborhood deprivation index (NDI)) and medical comorbidities (obesity, cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, renal disease, respiratory conditions). We estimated the adjusted risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization (≤30 days of infection) associated with smoking status using Cox proportional hazard regression models. We estimated associations within subgroups of socio-demographics and comorbidities, and tested for effect modification using interaction terms. During the study, 35,627 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Current versus never-smoking status was associated with lower adjusted rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR ranging from 0.51 to 0.89) and hospitalization (aHR ranging from 0.32 to 0.70) within nearly every socio-demographic and comorbidity subgroup. Statistically significant interactions showed that the magnitude of protection for SARS-CoV-2 infection varied by sex, age, race/ethnicity, NDI, cardiovascular conditions and diabetes, and for SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization by age and renal disease. Taken together, results indicated that while some socio-demographics and comorbidities moderated the associations, the lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization associated with current versus never-smoking status persisted among patients regardless of socio-demographics or comorbidities.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: PATH Study data collected in 2021 (Wave 6) and 2022/23 (Wave 7) were analyzed. Participants were adults who smoked cigarettes daily ages 40+ who were diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, congestive heart failure, heart attack, stroke, cancer, and/or diabetes as of 2021 (N = 1261). We determined in 2022/23 their past 12-month use of e-cigarettes, nicotine pouches, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and bupropion or varenicline; we evaluated whether use differed by several characteristics, and whether use was associated with cigarette quitting. RESULTS: Among adults who smoked with chronic disease, 40 % were not recently advised by a clinician to quit smoking and 27 % did not plan to ever quit. Between 2021 and 2022/23, 16 % used e-cigarettes, 14 % used NRT, 8 % used bupropion or varenicline, 3 % used nicotine pouches.

METHOD: A robust, filter analysis method was used to estimate the tar and nicotine yields for 784 subjects. Seventeen brands were chosen to represent a wide range of styles: 85 and 100 mm lengths; menthol and non-menthol; 17, 23, and 25 mm circumference; with tar yields [Federal Trade Commission (FTC) method] ranging from 1 to 18 mg. Tar bands chosen corresponded to yields of 1-3 mg, 4-6 mg, 7-12 mg, and 13+ mg. RESULTS: A significant difference (p<0.0001) in HS yields of tar and nicotine between tar bands was found. Machine-smoked yields were reasonable predictors of the HS yields for groups of subjects, but the relationship was neither exact nor linear. Neither the FTC, the Massachusetts (MA) nor the Canadian Intensive (CI) machine-smoking methods accurately reflect the HS yields across all brands. The FTC method was closest for the 7-12 mg and 13+ mg products and the MA method was closest for the 1-3mg products. The HS yields for the 4-6 mg products were approximately midway between the FTC and the MA yields.

More sensitive pulmonary function parameters might mirror those early changes and might show a dose response. METHODS: In a randomized three-period cross-over design 57 male adult conventional cigarette (CC)-smokers (age: 45.1+/-7.1 years) smoked either CC (tar:11 mg, nicotine:0.8 mg, carbon monoxide:11 mg [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)]), or used as a potential reduced-exposure product the electrically heated smoking system (EHCSS) (tar:5 mg, nicotine:0.3 mg, carbon monoxide:0.45 mg (FTC)) or did not smoke (NS). After each 3-day exposure period, hematology and exposure parameters were determined preceding body plethysmography. RESULTS: Cigarette smoke exposure was significantly (p<0.0001) higher in CC than in EHCSS and in NS: (carboxyhemoglobin: CC: 6.4+/-1.9%; EHCSS: 1.3+/-0.6%; NS: 0.5+/-0.3%; serum nicotine: CC: 18.9+/-7.4 ng/ml; EHCSS: 8.4+/-4.3 ng/ml; NS: 1.2+/-1.6 ng/ml). Significantly lower in CC than in EHCSS and NS were specific airway conductance (0.22+/-0.09; 0.25+/-0.12; 0.25+/-0.1 1/cmH(2)O x s; CC vs EHCSS: p<0.05; CC vs NS: p<0.01), forced expiratory flow 25% (7.6+/-1.7; 7.8+/-1.7; 7.9+/-1.7 L/s; CC vs EHCSS or NS: p<0.01).

Determination of free-base nicotine in the aqueous extracts of smokeless tobacco products and the relevance of these findings to product design parameters.,"Reports in the peer-reviewed literature and popular press have alleged that smokeless tobacco product (STP) manufacturers increase the addictiveness of their products by adjusting formulae to increase the relative percentage of nicotine in STP that is not protonated. Such nicotine is more popularly, but incorrectly, known as free-base nicotine (""FBN"") as it is a calculated amount as opposed to a real chemical species in the STP. Some regulators have mandated reporting of FBN as estimated by Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (""HHE"") using the pH-value of an aqueous suspension (or extract) of STP. This is technically incorrect because the HHE is only valid in pure dilute aqueous solution of a single base and its conjugate acid. The aqueous suspensions (or extracts) of STP often contain high concentrations of salts and polymeric anions such as pectate and many other compounds, and there is a molar excess of ammonia over nicotine in some products. These are heretofore-unrecognized sources of error in use of the HHE to estimate relative amount of nicotine that is not protonated results in inaccurate FBN-values. Thus, it is not surprising that attempts to show the relevance of estimated value of FBN in STP to human physiology have failed.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In this work, a filter analysis technique which addresses this fundamental limitation was used to measure mouth level exposures (MLE) to tar and nicotine in 1330 smokers of 26 brand-styles of US cigarettes covering a wide range of machine-generated yields. Despite the high degree of variability observed among individual smokers, MLEs were significantly correlated with machine-derived tar and nicotine yields (r=0.423 for nicotine MLE/cigarette; r=0.493 for tar MLE/cigarette; p<0.001 for both). Mean tar and nicotine MLE was higher for males than for females. Mean MLE across races was generally similar. Menthol cigarettes tended toward lower MLE than non-menthol cigarettes and King-Size cigarettes (≈ 83 mm) tended toward lower MLE than 100's cigarettes (≈ 100 mm), though those trends were not statistically significant. There were good agreements between MLEs measured in a group of 159 subjects smoking their usual cigarette brand-style on two separate occasions and between two independent groups of subjects smoking the same brand-styles.

The method, however, can lead to distorted interpretations, especially in the case of ratios from ultra-low tar yield cigarettes. In brief, as tar yields decrease below the 5–6 mg per cigarette range, the tar-to-nicotine ratio (TNR) decreases rapidly in a non-linear fashion. If, however, the nicotine yield, rather than the ratio, is plotted versus the tar yield, the non-linearity disappears and a straight line is obtained, with a slight positive intercept for nicotine on the ordinate. Unlike the ratio, the slope appears to depend only on the concentration of the nicotine in the blend and does not appear to vary with smoking parameters such as puff volume, puff interval or length smoked or with cigarette design parameters such as length, circumference or the amount of filtration or filter ventilation. Therefore, such a slope is analogous to the TNR although, unlike that ratio, it is invariant. Even more simply, the concentration of the nicotine in the blend, at least for American blend-style cigarettes, provides a similar index.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['British American Tobacco'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

For nicotine, catechol, hydroquinone, benzo(a)pyrene and formaldehyde the mean yields increased with increasing ""tar"" yields. Constituent yields for the ultra-low ""tar"" and low ""tar"" cigarettes were not significantly different for most other analytes as ventilation blocking defeated any filter air dilution design features.

The e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes were evaluated using machine-puffing to compare nicotine delivery and relative yields of chemical constituents. The e-liquids tested were found to contain humectants, glycerin and/or propylene glycol, (⩾75% content); water (<20%); nicotine (approximately 2%); and flavor (<10%). The aerosol collected mass (ACM) of the e-cigarette samples was similar in composition to the e-liquids. Aerosol nicotine for the e-cigarette samples was 85% lower than nicotine yield for the conventional cigarettes. Analysis of the smoke from conventional cigarettes showed that the mainstream cigarette smoke delivered approximately 1500times more harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) tested when compared to e-cigarette aerosol or to puffing room air. The deliveries of HPHCs tested for these e-cigarette products were similar to the study air blanks rather than to deliveries from conventional cigarettes; no significant contribution of cigarette smoke HPHCs from any of the compound classes tested was found for the e-cigarettes. Thus, the results of this study support previous researchers' discussion of e-cigarette products' potential for reduced exposure compared to cigarette smoke.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

This clinical study was designed to characterize e-cig users' exposure to nicotine, and to investigate the acute effects of e-cigs on the hemodynamic measurements (blood pressure and heart rate) in comparison with the effects of regular smoking. Five e-cigs and one Marlboro® cigarette were randomized for twenty-three participants under two exposure scenarios from Day 1 to Day 11: half-hour controlled administration and one hour ad lib use. The nicotine plasma concentrations after 1.5h of product use (C90) were significantly lower in the users of e-cigs than of Marlboro® cigarettes. The combination of glycerin and propylene glycol as the vehicle facilitated delivery of more nicotine than glycerin alone. The heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly elevated after use of Marlboro® cigarettes, but the elevation was less after use of most of the e-cigs. Use of e-cigs had no impact on the exhaled CO levels, whereas the Marlboro® cigarette significantly increased the exhaled CO more than 8 times above the baseline. In conclusion, e-cigs could be a less harmful alternative for tobacco users.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

The most significant potential contribution of ammonia is a possible interaction with the native, protonated nicotine in the smoke. Ammonia is more alkaline than nicotine and could facilitate a shift in the acid/base equilibrium where a fraction of the total nicotine converts to the more lipophilic, non-protonated form. This non-protonated, or free-base, form of nicotine absorbs more efficiently across membranes, resulting in more rapid delivery to the smoker's bloodstream. Ammonia and other potential ammonia sources, such as additives like diammonium phosphate, could influence the acid-base dynamics in cigarette smoke and ultimately the rate of nicotine delivery. To examine and characterize the ammonia content in modern cigarettes, we developed a fast, simple and reliable ion chromatography based method to measure extractable ammonia levels in cigarette filler. This approach has minimal sample preparation and short run times to achieve high sample throughput. We quantified ammonia levels in tobacco filler from 34 non-mentholated cigarette brands from 3 manufacturers to examine the ranges found across a convenience sampling of popular, commercially available domestic brands and present figures of analytical merit here. Ammonia levels ranged from approximately 0.9 to 2.4mg per gram of cigarette filler between brands and statistically significance differences were observed between brands and manufacturers. Our findings suggest that ammonia levels vary by brand and manufacturer; thus in domestic cigarettes ammonia could be considered a significant design feature because of the potential influence on smoke chemistry.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This paper presents background information on tobacco harm reduction, to complement the approaches aimed at increasing smoking cessation and reducing smoking initiation to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by cigarette smoking. THS2.2 heats tobacco without combustion, and the resulting formation of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHC) is greatly reduced compared with cigarette smoke. Assessment of the THS2.2 aerosol in vitro and in vivo reveals reduced toxicity and no new hazards. Additional mechanistic endpoints, measured as part of in vivo studies, confirmed reduced impact on smoking-related disease networks. The clinical study confirmed the reduced exposure to HPHCs in smokers switching to THS2.2, and the associated transcriptomic study confirmed the utility of a gene expression signature, consisting of only 11 genes tested in the blood transcriptome of subjects enrolled in the clinical study, as a complementary measure of exposure response.

Reducing circumference reduces tobacco mass burn rate, puff count and static burn time, and increases draw resistance and rod length burned during puff and smoulder periods. Smoulder temperature increases with decreasing circumference, but with no discernible effect on cigarette ignition propensity during a standard test. At constant packing density, mainstream (MS) and sidestream (SS) tar and nicotine yields decrease approximately linearly with decreasing circumference, as do the majority of smoke toxicants. However, volatile aldehydes, particularly formaldehyde, show a distinctly non-linear relationship with circumference and increases in the ratios of aldehydes to tar and nicotine have been observed as the circumference decreases. Mutagenic, cytotoxic and tumorigenic specific activities of smoke condensates (i.e. per unit weight of condensate) decrease as circumference decreases. Recent studies suggest that there is no statistical difference in mouth-level exposure to tar and nicotine among smokers of cigarettes with different circumferences. Commercially available slim cigarettes usually have changes in other cigarette design features compared with cigarettes with standard circumference, so it is difficult to isolate the effect of circumference on the properties of commercial products. However, available data shows that changes in cigarette circumference offer no discernible change to the harm associated with smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['British American Tobacco'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Reduction in respiratory minute volume, degree of lung inflammation, and histopathological findings in the respiratory tract organs were significantly less pronounced in THS2.2-exposed groups compared with 3R4F-exposed groups. Transcriptomics data obtained from nasal epithelium and lung parenchyma showed concentration-dependent differential gene expression following 3R4F exposure that was less pronounced in the THS2.2-exposed groups.

The concentrations of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) are significantly lower in THS2.2 mainstream aerosol than in smoke produced by combustible cigarettes. Different tobacco types and 43 tobacco blends were investigated to determine how the blend impacted the overall reductions of HPHCs in the THS2.2 mainstream aerosol. The blend composition had minimal effects on the yields of most HPHCs in the aerosol. Blends containing high proportions of nitrogen-rich tobacco, e.g., air-cured, and some Oriental tobaccos, produced higher acetamide, acrylamide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxide yields than did other blends. Most HPHCs were found to be released mainly through the distillation of HPHCs present in the tobacco plug or after being produced in simple thermal reactions. HPHC concentrations in the THS2.2 aerosol may therefore be further minimized by limiting the use of flue- and fire-cured tobaccos which may be contaminated by HPHCs during the curing process and carefully selecting nitrogen rich tobaccos with low concentrations of endogenous HPHCs for use in the tobacco plug blend.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,Yes,['Philip Morris International'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The standard endpoints were complemented by transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics analyses of respiratory nasal epithelium and lung tissue and by lipidomics analysis of lung tissue. The adaptive response of the respiratory nasal epithelium to conventional cigarette smoke (CS) included squamous cell metaplasia and an inflammatory response, with high correspondence between the molecular and histopathological results. In contrast to CS exposure, the adaptive tissue and molecular changes to THS2.2M aerosol exposure were much weaker and were limited mostly to the highest THS2.2M concentration in female rats. In the lung, CS exposure induced an inflammatory response, triggered cellular stress responses, and affected sphingolipid metabolism. These responses were not observed or were much lower after THS2.2M aerosol exposure.

Upregulation of specific miRNA species, such as miR-146a/b and miR-182, indicated that they are causal elements in the inflammatory response in CC-exposed lungs, but they were reduced after THS2.2 aerosol exposure. Transforming transcriptomic data into protein activity based on corresponding downstream gene expression, we identified potential mechanisms for miR-146a/b and miR-182 that were activated by CC smoke but not by THS2.2 aerosol and possibly involved in the regulation of those miRNAs.

Additionally, the utility of this framework is assessed through the pre-clinical and part of the clinical comparison of a commercial e-cigarette (Vype ePen) with a scientific reference cigarette (3R4F) and the results of these studies suggest that ePen has the potential to be a reduced risk product.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['British American Tobacco'],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

The Directive requires manufacturers and importers of cigarettes and Roll Your Own tobacco to examine for each additive whether it; contributes to and increases the toxicity or addictiveness of tobacco products to a significant or measurable degree; if it leads to a characterizing flavor of the product; if it facilitates inhalation or nicotine uptake, and if it results in the formation of CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic) constituents and if these substances increase the CMR properties of the respective tobacco product to a significant or measurable degree. This publication gives an overview on comprehensive smoke chemistry, in vitro toxicity, and human clinical studies commissioned by the members of the Priority Additives Tobacco Consortium to independent Contract Research Organizations (CROs) where the emissions of test cigarettes containing priority additives were compared to emissions emerging from an additive-free reference cigarette. Whilst minor changes in smoke chemistry parameters were observed when comparing emissions from test cigarettes with emissions from additive-free reference cigarettes, only two of the additives (sorbitol and guar gum) tested led to significant increases in a limited number of smoke constituents. These changes were not observed when sorbitol or guar gum were tested in a mixture with other priority additives. None of the priority additives resulted in increases in in vitro toxicity (Ames, Micronucleus, Neutral Red Uptake) or led to changes in smoking behavior or absorption (rate or amount) of nicotine measured during the human clinical study as compared to the additive-free reference cigarette.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,"['British American Tobacco', 'Generic tobacco/vape industry', 'Imperial Brands', 'Japan Tobacco', 'Philip Morris International']",None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In our clinical study, two distinct end points were investigated, namely measuring plasma nicotine pharmacokinetics as a measure of nicotine uptake, and analyses of changes in smoker puffing behavior as a measure of cigarette smoke inhalation. This clinical study indicated that the inclusion of none of the priority additives either as single additive or as part of a chemical mixture, facilitated nicotine uptake. Furthermore, the data did not suggest that differences in the inhalation pattern of cigarette smoke of any of the Priority Additives tested occurred when compared to the additive-free reference cigarette.

Recently the flavors in e-liquids were suggested to be the major source of these aldehydes. We used the same 10 ENDS devices to test 5 e-liquid formulations (four flavored & one corresponding non-flavored) and measured device mass loss and levels of acetaldehyde, acrolein, and formaldehyde (30 replicate measurements per formulation). Despite finding reasonable variability in measurements of device mass loss, two out of 10 ENDS devices tested produced outlier values for aerosol levels acetaldehyde, acrolein, and formaldehyde. After removing these devices from further analysis, acceptable variability (≤20% RSD) in aerosol levels of acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde were found. The flavored formulations tested resulted in a consistent and selective increase of 150%-200% in acetaldehyde, no increase or decrease in acrolein and depending on the flavor formulation, an increase, a decrease or no change in formaldehyde levels. Comparison of our results to the literature illustrates the need for development of a standardized ENDS testing protocol. Our results further support that device variability must be fully characterized and considered before assessing the impact of e-liquid formulations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The relative risk of coronary artery disease for smoking 20 cigarettes per day has been estimated by meta-analysis of five large prospective epidemiology studies to be 1.78. These four major smoke components are simultaneously delivered to the active smoker as a complex aerosol composed of several billion semi-liquid particles per cm(3) within the mixture of combustion gases. Fractional attribution of the 78% increase in reported risk to a given constituent is problematic because of the complex mixture. However, a significant literature exists which suggests that some general statements regarding smoke constituent-associated risks for development or exacerbation of myocardial infarction are supportable. First, the atherogenic potential of MS is associated with the particulate and vapor phases and not with CO. Nicotine might exert an indirect effect on atherosclerotic plaque development by increasing shear forces in main conduction arteries. Similarly, the thrombogenic potential is associated primarily with the particulate and vapor phases and also possibly with nicotine via platelet aggregation. Vasoconstriction probably results from the actions of nicotine and hypoxia from carbon monoxide. Finally, the arrhythmia-inducing potential may result from catecholamine release following nicotine exposure, with a questionable contribution from carbon monoxide.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Stomach cancer was the country's leading cause of cancer death for most of the 20th century, until lung cancer took over this position in 1993. Cigarettes are the major cause of lung cancer in Japan, but the country's leading manufacturer, Japan Tobacco, two thirds of which is owned by the Japanese government, continues to question whether tobacco is a major cause of disease and death. Japanese courts do not have the power to subpoena a company's internal records, which has made it difficult to document Japan Tobacco's strategies concerning tobacco and health. Our interpretation of online archives of internal documents from American tobacco companies, however, is that Japan Tobacco has long known about the potential health risks involved in smoking and has sought to obstruct effective tobacco control. Beginning in the mid-1980s, these efforts were often co-ordinated with American tobacco manufacturers. The documentary evidence shows that cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris in particular assisted with and sometimes also supervised Japan Tobacco's actions and statements on smoking and health. In one instance, data gathered for an article published by the Japan Public Monopoly Corporation (Japan Tobacco's predecessor) were deliberately altered to lower the reported value of a hazard indicator (nicotine concentration in the air). International collaboration has made it easier for companies such as Japan Tobacco to develop effective anti-antismoking strategies. Evidence of such global industry collaborations might grow as lawsuits begin to be filed in other nations.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In particular, there is an immediate need to improve our understanding of the interaction between smoking behaviour and product design, and its influence on cigarette deliveries. This article reviews internal tobacco industry documents on smoking behaviour research undertaken by Imperial Tobacco Limited (ITL) and British-American Tobacco (BAT). BAT documents indicate that smokers vary their puffing behaviour to regulate nicotine levels and compensate for low-yield cigarettes by smoking them more intensely. BAT research also shows that the tar and nicotine delivered to smokers is substantially greater than the machine-smoked yields reported to consumers and regulators. Internal documents describe a strategy to maximise this discrepancy through product design. In particular, BAT developed elastic cigarettes that produced low yields under standard testing protocols, whereas in consumers' hands they elicited more intensive smoking and provided higher concentrations of tar and nicotine to smokers. Documents also show that BAT pursued this product strategy despite the health risks to consumers and ethical concerns raised by senior scientists, and paired it with an equally successful marketing campaign that promoted these cigarettes as low-tar alternatives for health-concerned smokers. Overall, the documents seem to reveal a product strategy intended to exploit the limitations of the testing protocols and to intentionally conceal from consumers and regulators the potential toxicity of BAT products revealed by BAT's own research. Tobacco industry research underscores the serious limitations of the current cigarette testing protocols and the documents describe deceptive business practices that remain in place.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Monitoring of prevalence is inadequate in many countries, as is investment in research and capacity to address this largest avoidable cause of death and disability across Europe. However, grounds for optimism are provided by progress in implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and in the development of a new generation of nicotine-containing devices that could enable more widespread adoption of harm-reduction strategies.

A tobacco-free world by 2040, where less than 5% of the world's adult population use tobacco, is socially desirable, technically feasible, and could become politically practical. Three possible ways forward exist: so-called business-as-usual, with most countries steadily implementing the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) provisions; accelerated implementation of the FCTC by all countries; and a so-called turbo-charged approach that complements FCTC actions with strengthened UN leadership, full engagement of all sectors, and increased investment in tobacco control. Only the turbo-charged approach will achieve a tobacco-free world by 2040 where tobacco is out of sight, out of mind, and out of fashion--yet not prohibited. The first and most urgent priority is the inclusion of an ambitious tobacco target in the post-2015 sustainable development health goal. The second priority is accelerated implementation of the FCTC policies in all countries, with full engagement from all sectors including the private sector--from workplaces to pharmacies--and with increased national and global investment. The third priority is an amendment of the FCTC to include an ambitious global tobacco reduction goal. The fourth priority is a UN high-level meeting on tobacco use to galvanise global action towards the 2040 tobacco-free world goal on the basis of new strategies, new resources, and new players.

Condensate from the mainstream smoke of a cigarette which primarily heats tobacco (test cigarette) has shown significantly reduced mutagenicity in a battery of in vitro genotoxicity assays compared with tobacco-burning cigarettes. The objective of this study was to determine whether the reduction in mutagenic activity observed in the in vitro assays would be reflected in the urine of smokers of the test cigarette. Twenty smokers were enrolled in a 4-week crossover study, with each smoker consuming test cigarettes ad libitum for a week and their usual brand of tobacco-burning cigarettes the other 3 weeks. Diet was strictly controlled throughout the study, and broiled and pan-fried meat was not served to minimize ingestion of mutagenic protein pyrolysis products. There was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.06) in consumption of tobacco-heating and tobacco-burning cigarettes. There were no statistically significant differences (p = 0.22) in salivary cotinine concentrations for smokers when smoking either tobacco-burning or tobacco-heating cigarettes. Urinary nicotine (ng/mg creatinine) was not different (p = 0.31) for smokers when smoking either tobacco-burning or tobacco-heating cigarettes. Urinary cotinine (ng/mg creatinine) was 32% lower (p = 0.0004) when smoking tobacco-heating cigarettes as compared with smoking tobacco-burning cigarettes. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected twice weekly, concentrated using XAD-2 resin and tested in Ames strains TA98 and YG1024 with metabolic activation. Tobacco-burning cigarette smokers experienced a 79% reduction in urinary mutagenicity as measured in strain YG1024 and a 72% reduction as measured in strain TA98 during the week that they smoked the tobacco-heating cigarette while maintaining a fixed dietary regimen. The results of this study indicate that smokers of tobacco-heating cigarettes void urine which is significantly less mutagenic than urine voided by smokers of tobacco-burning cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Several pharmacological treatments to reduce tobacco addiction are currently available. One of these treatments, bupropion, has remarkable efficacy (30% over 1 year) compared with nicotine replacement therapies (chewing gum 8%, patches 17% over 1 year). The objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of three smoking cessation strategies based on pharmacotherapies in Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The current situation of methods for smoking cessation in Spain includes a mixture of primary care physician advice, group therapy and willpower, combined with the use of drugs in a small proportion of individuals. This situation was compared with three scenarios in which the use of the available pharmacotherapies was increased (by up to 10%) for 1 year. A cost-effectiveness evaluation was used to calculate the cost per death prevented and per year of life saved in each scenario. The analysis used a time horizon of 20 years and was based on an adaptation of the HECOS model, sponsored by WHO-Euro, which enables comparison of distinct pharmacotherapy interventions. Epidemiological data were based on the National Health Survey (1997) and the National Institute of Statistics (1999). RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness ratio of bupropion at 5 years was 70,939 euros per death prevented and was 37,305 euros per year of life saved. When the time horizon was increased to 20 years, these figures became net savings of 28,166 and 3,265 euros, respectively. The cost-effectiveness ratios for both nicotine gums and patches were higher than that for bupropion: 171,834 euros per death prevented at 5 years and 90,362 euros per year of life saved for patches and 513,004 euros per death prevented and 269,772 euros per year of life saved at 5 years. Furthermore, bupropion treatment for 1 year would prevent a greater number of deaths than the alternative strategies (approximately 3,000 deaths in a time horizon of 20 years) due to the decrease in the number of smokers. CONCLUSIONS: The cost of some tobacco cessation methods, such as primary care physician advice and group therapy, is low but their efficacy is also low. New drug treatments increase costs and also achieve higher efficacy rates. When assessing interventions and their costs economic evaluation shows that in the long run greater use of bupropion generates net savings in tobacco-related health costs.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the temperature at which tobacco is pyrolyzed or combusted can affect the mutagenicity of the particulate fraction of the smoke aerosol. Tobacco smoke aerosol was generated under precisely controlled temperature conditions from 250 to 550 degrees C by heating compressed tobacco tablets in air. The tobacco aerosols generated had a cigarette smoke-like appearance and aroma. The tobacco smoke aerosol was passed through a Cambridge filter pad to collect the particulate fraction, termed the smoke condensate. Although condensates of tobacco smoke and whole cigarette mainstream smoke share many of the same chemical components, there are physical and chemical differences between the two complex mixtures. The condensates from smoke aerosols prepared at different temperatures were assayed in the Ames Salmonella microsome test with metabolic activation by rat liver S9 using tester strains TA98 and TA100. Tobacco smoke condensates were not detectably mutagenic in strain TA98 when the tobacco smoke aerosol was generated at temperatures below 400 degrees C. Above 400 degrees C, condensates were mutagenic in strain TA98. Similarly, condensates prepared from tobacco smoke aerosols generated at temperatures below 475 degrees C were not detectably mutagenic in strain TA100. In contrast, tobacco tablets heated to temperatures of 475 degrees C or greater generated smoke aerosol that was detectably mutagenic as measured in TA100. Therefore, heating and pyrolyzing tobacco at temperatures below those found in tobacco burning cigarettes reduces the mutagenicity of the smoke condensate. Highly mutagenic heterocyclic amines derived from the pyrolysis of tobacco leaf protein may be important contributors to the high temperature production of tobacco smoke Ames Salmonella mutagens. The relevance of these findings regarding cancer risk in humans is difficult to assess because of the lack of a direct correlation between mutagenicity in the Ames Salmonella test and carcinogenicity.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

Part I: Flavourings and additives.,"The effects of 450 tobacco ingredients added to tobacco on the forty-four ""Hoffmann analytes"" in mainstream cigarette smoke have been determined. These analytes are believed by regulatory authorities in the USA and Canada to be relevant to smoking-related diseases. They are based on lists published by D. Hoffmann and co-workers of the American Health Foundation in New York. The ingredients comprised 431 flavours, 1 flavour/solvent, 1 solvent, 7 preservatives, 5 binders, 2 humectants, 2 process aids and 1 filler. The cigarettes containing mixtures of the ingredients were smoked using the standard ISO smoking machine conditions. The levels of the ""Hoffmann analytes"" in the smoke from the test cigarettes containing the ingredient mixture were compared to those from control cigarettes without the ingredients. In practice, flavouring ingredients are typically added to tobacco that also contains casing ingredients and reconstituted tobacco materials. In order to keep the tobacco mixtures as authentic as possible, three comparisons have been made in this study. These are: (a) control cigarette containing a typical US blended, cased tobacco incorporating reconstituted tobacco versus test cigarettes that had flavouring ingredients added to this tobacco; (b) control cigarette containing tobacco only versus test cigarettes with the tobacco cased and incorporating flavourings; (c) control cigarette containing tobacco only versus test cigarette incorporating additives made in an experimental sheet material. The significances of differences between the test and control cigarettes were determined using both the variability of the data on the specific occasion of the measurement, and also taking into account the long-term variability of the analytical measurements over the one-year period in which analyses were determined in the present study. This long-term variability was determined by measuring the levels of the 44 ""Hoffmann analytes"" in a reference cigarette on many occasions over the one-year period of this study. The ingredients were added to the experimental cigarettes at or above the maximum levels used commercially by British American Tobacco. The effect of the ingredient mixtures on total particulate matter and carbon monoxide levels in smoke was not significantly different to the control in most cases, and was never more than 10% with any ingredient mixture. It was found that, in most cases, the mixtures of flavouring ingredients (generally added in parts per million levels) had no statistically significant effect on the analyte smoke yields relative to the control cigarette. Occasionally with some of the mixtures, both increases and decreases were observed for some smoke analyte levels relative to the control cigarette. These differences were generally up to about 15% with the mixtures containing flavouring ingredients. The significance of many of the differences was not present when the long-term variability of the analytical methodology was taken into account. For the test cigarettes with ingredient mixtures containing casing ingredients, there were again no significant changes in smoke analyte levels in most cases. Those changes that were observed are as follows. Decreases in smoke levels were observed with some ingredient mixtures for most of the tobacco specific nitrosamines (up to 24%), NO(x), most of the phenols (up to 34%), benzo[a]pyrene, and some of the aromatic amines and miscellaneous organic compounds on the ""Hoffmann list"". Increases were observed for some test cigarettes in smoke ammonia, HCN, formaldehyde and lead levels (up to 24%). The significance of the ammonia and lead increases was not present when the long-term variability of the analytical methodology was taken into account. The yields of some carbonyl compounds in smoke were increased in one comparison with an additives mixture containing cellulosic components; in particular, formaldehyde was increased by 68%. This was the largest single change seen in any smoke analyte level in this study. These carbonyls are produced from the pyrolysis of cellulosnyls are produced from the pyrolysis of cellulosic and other polysaccharide materials, present in the additives mixture. With this test cigarette, all tobacco specific nitrosamines, phenols, semi-volatile bases, NO(x) and some aromatic amines and miscellaneous organic compounds on the ""Hoffmann list"" were decreased, by up to 22%. The significance of many of these differences remained even when the long-term variability of the analytical methodology was taken into account. The levels of all other ""Hoffmann analytes"" in the smoke were not significantly different to those of the control cigarette. With the exception of the determinations of ""tar"", nicotine and carbon monoxide, there are currently no internationally recognised standard methods for measurement of the other ""Hoffmann analytes"". Each laboratory uses its own methods and there are large laboratory-to-laboratory variations, as well as variations over time in a given laboratory. Therefore, it is important that in any comparison of smoke analytes amongst different cigarettes, all the analytes should be measured in the same laboratory and at the same time. This was the case in the present study and all the methods have been validated internally.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['British American Tobacco'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

B, Biomedical sciences and applications",Capillary electrophoresis as an analytical tool for monitoring nicotine in ATF regulated tobacco products.,"Tobacco products are classified at different excise tax rates according to the Code of Federal Regulations. These include cigars, cigarettes, pipe tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, chewing tobacco and snuff. Nicotine is the primary determinant of what constitutes a tobacco product from a regulatory standpoint. Determination of nicotine, therefore, is of primary importance and interest to ATF. Since nicotine is also the most abundant alkaloid found in tobacco, comprising about 98% of the total alkaloid content, a rapid method for the determination of nicotine in ATF regulated products is desirable. Capillary electrophoresis (CE), as an analytical technique, is rapidly gaining importance capturing the interest of analysts in several areas. The unique and powerful capabilities of CE including high resolution and short analysis times, make it a powerful analytical tool in the regulatory area as well. Preliminary studies using a 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2.5 at 260 nm have yielded promising results for the analysis of nicotine in tobacco products. Application of an analytical method for the determination of nicotine by CE to ATF regulated tobacco products will be presented.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The first objective was to optimize the neutral red assay for evaluation of CSCs. This study also assessed and compared the cytotoxicity of smoke condensates from three reference cigarettes which differ in 'tar' content; cigarettes of different tobacco type composition; an ultra-low tar cigarette (R1); and an RJR test cigarette which heats but does not burn tobacco. Finally, this study investigated the cytotoxicity of a specific CSC component, nicotine, and its metabolite, cotinine. Exposure times of 24 hours or longer using CHO cells provided optimal conditions for evaluation of CSC cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity of CSCs from reference cigarettes was similar. CSC from cigarettes comprised of flue-cured tobacco exhibited greater cytotoxicity than CSC from cigarettes comprised of burley tobacco. CSC from the R1 cigarette exhibited similar cytotoxicity compared with 1R4F CSC. The CSC from a cigarette that heated but did not burn tobacco (RJR test cigarette) demonstrated no cytotoxicity in CHO cells. Finally, nicotine and cotinine were not cytotoxic to CHO cells. The neutral red assay has been proved useful for quantifying differences in cytotoxicity of smoke condensates from cigarettes which vary in 'tar' yield and for assessing specific smoke constituents.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The financial resources to carry on the battle for tobacco control are still heavily stacked in favor of the industry, which by current estimates is worth $45 billion, including $6 billion spent each year on advertising and promotion alone. Nonetheless, industry executives must realize that, even if they can win individual battles, they are losing the war. This article has discussed key events in the history of tobacco control, as well as some of the most innovative strategies currently being used for tobacco control. Although it is important that tobacco control efforts be disseminated widely and through novel channels, the challenge facing public health advocates in the next several decades will be to anticipate the industry's response to key initiatives, as well as to launch organized and strategic counterattacks against efforts to dissuade acceptance of such initiatives. The history of tobacco control demonstrates that public health advocacy resources should be strategically focused in precisely the areas in which the industry feels most vulnerable (e.g., nicotine addiction, regulation of nicotine, environmental tobacco smoke), rather than in areas in which the industry maintains a vocal presence for the purposes of public relations (e.g., youth access). Through its lobbying efforts and financial clout, the tobacco industry has played a key role in the development of public health policy. Although it is no secret that the tobacco industry regularly makes campaign contributions to both Republicans and Democrats, the impact of these donations on public policy making have only recently begun to be quantified and documented. Moore et al found that the more tobacco money a politician received, the less likely he or she was to support tobacco control legislation. Similar distortional effects of tobacco money have been demonstrated at the state level. The political expenditure of 12 tobacco firms increased 10-fold in California after the implementation of Proposition 99 in California--from $790,050 in the 1985-1986 election, to $7,615,091 in the 1991-1992 election. In an analysis of the behavior of the California legislature between 1991 and 1992, a statistically significant relationship was found between members' receipt of tobacco money and their likelihood of opposing tobacco control measures. Tobacco control advocates as well as health professionals in general have an important role to play in holding their legislators accountable for developing public health policy that reflects the concerns of their constituencies, not of the tobacco lobby. Public health advocates should pay particular attention to the recent regulations placed on cigarettes as a key tobacco control strategy for the next several decades. For the first time in the history of the United States, a President has introduced legislation that will allow a governmental agency to regulate tobacco. The FDA has faced relentless attacks by the tobacco industry, and it will continue to be a target. Public health advocates and health care providers have a critical role to play in the FDA's efforts to bring this issue to fruition. If the public health community fails to support this initiative and create an active and forceful opposition to the industry's efforts to derail it, it is likely that the impact on tobacco control efforts will be resounding and far-reaching.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Studying the characteristics of the particle size distribution of cigarette smoke can aid in providing knowledge of smoke aerosol attributes. We used an electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI) to measure the particle size distribution of mainstream cigarette smoke generated by a smoking machine and provided a continuum of particle sizes of cigarette smoke from a whole cigarette. The results showed that the aerodynamic diameters (D, geometric mean of a channel) of particles ranged from 0.021 to 1.956 μm, and the number concentrations were on the order of 10(5)-10(9) cm(-3) for different sizes of particles. The particle number of the size category below 0.1 μm approximated that of the category 0.1-2.0 μm, and the particles in the size category of 0.1-2.0 μm contributed extremely heavily to total particulate mass. In addition, the results with small samples indicated that the tar yields normalized per milligram of nicotine showed an approximately linear increase with increasing concentration of total particles.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The physiologic effects of active, and possibly passive smoke exposure include endothelial injury, increased oxidizability of LDL cholesterol, lower HDL cholesterol, impaired exercise performance, and altered oxygen delivery.

NNAL can be pyridine N-oxidized to form NNAL-N-oxide, or conjugated to form NNAL-glucuronide - non-genotoxic metabolites that can be excreted in urine. Alternatively, NNAL can be alpha-hydroxylated at the methyl and methylene carbons adjacent to the nitroso group to generate electrophiles that can react with biological macromolecules, such as DNA and proteins. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the mutagenicity of NNK was significantly inhibited by the aqueous extract of tobacco smoke, as well as pyridine alkaloids in cigarette smoke, such as nicotine, cotinine and nornicotine. Given the structural similarity between NNK and NNAL, and the metabolic activation of both by cytochromes P450, we hypothesized that there may be a similar inhibition of NNAL metabolism, and consequently, inhibition of the mutagenic activity of NNAL by tobacco smoke and its pyridine alkaloid constituents. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of two pyridine alkaloids (nicotine and cotinine) and aqueous cigarette smoke condensate extract (ACTE) to inhibit the mutagenicity of NNAL in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535 in the presence of a metabolic activation system (S9). Both pyridine alkaloids tested, as well as ACTE, inhibited the mutagenicity of NNAL in a concentration-dependent manner. The observed reductions in mutagenicity were not the result of cell killing due to cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate that tobacco smoke contains pyridine alkaloids, as well as other unidentified constituents that inhibit the mutagenicity of NNAL, a major metabolite of NNK.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The objective of the present study was to determine urine mutagenicity in groups of smokers of ultra-low 'tar' (ULT), full-flavor low 'tar' (FFLT) and full-flavor 'tar' (FF) filtered cigarettes after switching to primarily tobacco-heating Eclipse cigarettes. Sixty-seven smokers maintained a specified diet and consumed ad libitum their usual brands of cigarettes, switched to Eclipse, and switched back to their usual brands. Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected weekly, concentrated on XAD-2 resin, and tested in the Ames mutagenicity assay using bacterial strains TA98 and YG1024 with S9 metabolic activation. Daily consumption of cigarettes was not significantly different (at P<0.05) between FTC 'tar' categories and average daily cigarette consumption did not change significantly in any smoker group after switching to Eclipse cigarettes. Average urine mutagenicity was 47% less (P<0.05) for ULT than for FFLT usual brand smokers as measured by the more sensitive strain YG1024, although no significant differences (P<0.05) were observed in urine mutagenicity between usual brand FTC 'tar' categories as measured by strain TA98. The reduction in urinary mutagens in the more sensitive strain, YG1024, observed in ULT smokers as compared with higher 'tar' categories suggest reduced exposure to mutagens. Usual brand salivary cotinine in the ULT group was significantly lower (P<0.05) than the FF group and the FFLT group. Salivary cotinine did not differ significantly (at P<0.05) among the smoker groups when smoking Eclipse compared to usual brand. After switching to Eclipse, the following reductions in urinary mutagenicity were observed: ULT, 70.1+/-6.4% (TA98), 70.9+/-6.2% (YG1024); FFLT, 77.1+/-2.4% (TA98), 73.6+/-2.0% (YG1024); and FF, 76.1+/-3.5% (TA98), 71.4+/-4.0% (YG1024). Across all 'tar' categories, cigarette smokers experienced significant reductions (P<0.05) in urine mutagenicity, but not salivary cotinine, upon switching to Eclipse. The reduction in urine mutagenicity when smoking Eclipse provides supporting evidence that Eclipse may present less risk of cancer compared to cigarettes currently in the market.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

Oncology,Strategic marketing in the UK tobacco industry.,"Tobacco-industry marketing has played a central part in the global spread of tobacco use and addiction. Although the absolute size of the tobacco market has dwindled, the industry is still immensely successful, largely due to sophisticated and manipulative marketing strategies. The UK tobacco industry identifies target groups and builds enduring relationships based on careful brand management. Potential customers are exposed to brands which are likely to appeal to them most. Tobacco companies tailor their products to target markets by altering the content of tar and nicotine, and by adding flavourings to produce a distinctive taste. Marketing strategies ensure that the products are promoted heavily at the point of sale, and directed advertising and sponsorship agreements are used to increase the visibility of the brand and strengthen its image. Tobacco companies also target non-consumer organisations such as retailers and policy makers with the aim of creating the best possible business environment for tobacco sales. We review published evidence, internal-advertising-agency documents, and observational data about tobacco promotion, and discuss the use of targeted marketing strategies in the UK.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Respiratory medicine,"Effect of an electronic nicotine delivery system with 0, 8, or 36 mg/mL liquid nicotine versus a cigarette substitute on tobacco-related toxicant exposure: a four-arm, parallel-group, randomised, controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDSs) are used by some smokers to reduce cigarette consumption, but their effectiveness is uncertain. We aimed to examine the extent to which ENDSs or a non-nicotine cigarette substitute influence tobacco-related toxicant exposure and cigarette consumption in smokers interested in smoking reduction. METHODS: We did a four-arm, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial at two sites in the USA (Penn State University, Hershey, PA, and Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). We enrolled adults aged 21-65 years who smoked more than nine cigarettes per day (for at least the past year), with exhaled CO of more than 9 parts per million at screening, who were not currently using an ENDS, and who were interested in reducing smoking but not quitting. Participants were randomised (site-specific with allocation concealment; 1:1:1:1) to receive either a cartomiser-based, pen-style ENDS (eGo-style) paired with 0, 8, or 36 mg/mL liquid nicotine (participants and researchers masked to concentration) or a non-ENDS cigarette-shaped plastic tube that delivered no nicotine or aerosol (cigarette substitute; unmasked) for 24 weeks. Conditions were chosen to reflect a range of nicotine delivery including none (cigarette substitute and 0 mg/mL ENDS), low (8 mg/mL), and cigarette-like (36 mg/mL), and all conditions were paired with smoking reduction instructions. The primary outcome was concentration of the tobacco-specific carcinogen metabolite 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL; urinary total) collected at randomisation and at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Multiple imputation with and without covariate adjustment was used in addition to sensitivity analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02342795. FINDINGS: Between July 22, 2015, and Nov 16, 2017, 684 individuals were screened and 520 (76%) were enrolled and randomised. 188 (36%) of 520 participants were lost to follow-up by week 24; attrition did not differ by study group (39 [30%] of 130 in the cigarette substitute group, 56 [43%] of 130 in the ENDS with 0 mg/mL nicotine group, 49 [38%] of 130 in the ENDS 8 mg/mL group, and 44 [34%] of 130 in the ENDS 36 mg/mL group). Urinary total NNAL at 24 weeks in the ENDS with 36 mg/mL nicotine group was 210·80 pg/mg creatinine (95% CI 163·03-274·42) compared with 346·09 pg/mg creatinine (265·00-455·32) in the cigarette substitute group (p=0·0061). No other significant differences between groups were observed for any time point for urinary total NNAL. Serious adverse event frequency was similar across groups (12 events in 12 participants [9%] in the ENDS with 36 mg/mL nicotine group, seven events in six participants [5%] in the 8 mg/mL group, 11 events in ten participants [8%] in the 0 mg/mL group, and 13 events in 13 participants [10%] in the cigarette substitute group), and all of these were deemed unrelated or unlikely to be related to study product use. There was one death between randomisation and 24 weeks (suicide; in the ENDS with 0 mg/mL nicotine group). INTERPRETATION: Use of an ENDS with cigarette-like nicotine delivery can reduce exposure to a major pulmonary carcinogen, NNAL, even with concurrent smoking. Future ENDS trials should involve products with well characterised nicotine delivery, including those with nicotine delivery approaching that of a cigarette.

Tobacco product use is a potential susceptibility factor. In this Personal View, we provide an overview of the findings of peer-reviewed, published studies relating tobacco product use to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes, with most studies focusing on cigarette smoking in adults. Findings pertaining to the effects of tobacco product use on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection are inconsistent. However, evidence supports a role for cigarette smoking in increasing the risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes, including hospital admission, progression in disease severity, and COVID-19-related mortality. We discuss the potential effects of tobacco use behaviour on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection, and highlight the pathophysiological changes associated with cigarette smoking that could promote SARS-CoV-2 infection and increased disease severity. We consider the biological mechanisms by which nicotine and other tobacco product constituents might affect immune and inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we identify current knowledge gaps and suggest priorities for research to address acute and post-acute health outcomes of COVID-19 during and after the pandemic.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Respiratory medicine,Policy view: worldwide patterns of tobacco use with recommendations for tobacco control.,"The global epidemic of tobacco-related diseases continues to be a major health and economic issue. The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), adopted in 2003, is a legally binding treaty aimed at reducing the demand for and supply of tobacco products, with 183 Parties, comprising countries and the EU, covering more than 90% of the world's population. This Policy View presents an analysis of the global patterns of tobacco use, the effects of the WHO FCTC and measures implemented for tobacco control, barriers to progress, and the principal ways forward. Our paper focuses on the overarching challenge of uneven WHO FCTC and tobacco control implementation across countries and policy domains, as well as related implementation barriers of insufficient funding and tobacco industry interference in policy development and implementation. The necessary response is the concerted application of WHO FCTC Article 5.3 protections against the political and scientific practices of the tobacco industry and its affiliates. This response to industry's interference needs to be supported by efforts to increase funding and strengthen political will to act in favour of health. A further challenge is the aggressive commercial marketing-particularly to young people and with unproven health claims-of new tobacco products, such as heated tobacco products, and new nicotine products, such as e-cigarettes.

Public health,Targeted smoking cessation for dual users of combustible and electronic cigarettes: a randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Although many smokers use electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) to quit smoking, most continue to smoke while vaping. This dual use might delay cessation and increase toxicant exposure. We aimed to test the efficacy of a self-help intervention designed to help dual users to quit smoking. METHODS: In this three-arm randomised controlled trial we recruited individuals in the USA using Facebook and multimedia advertisements. Included participants were 18 years or older, smoked at least weekly in the preceding year, and vaped at least weekly in the preceding month. We used computer generated randomisation with balanced-permuted blocks (block size 10, with 2-4-4 ratio) to allocate participants to assessment only (ASSESS group), generic smoking cessation self-help booklets (GENERIC group), or booklets targeting dual users (eTARGET group). Individuals in the generic or targeted intervention groups received monthly cessation materials for 18 months, with assessments every 3 months for 24 months. The main outcome was self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at each assessment point. All randomly allocated participants were included in primary analyses using generalised estimating equations for each of 20 datasets created by multiple imputation. Analysis of the χ2s produced an F test. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02416011, and is now closed. FINDINGS: Between July 12, 2016, and June 30, 2017, we randomly assigned 2896 dual users (575 to assessment, 1154 to generic intervention, and 1167 to targeted self-help). 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence increased from 14% at 3 months to 42% at 24 months (F7,541·7=67·1, p<0·0001) in the overall sample. Targeted self-help resulted in higher smoking abstinence than did assessment alone throughout the treatment period (F1,973·8=10·20, p=0·0014 [α=0·017]). The generic intervention group had abstinence rates between those of the assessment and targeted groups, but did not significantly differ from either when adjusted for multiple comparisons (GENERIC vs eTARGET F1,1102·5=1·79, p=0·18 [α=0·05]; GENERIC vs ASSESS F1,676·7=4·29, p=0·039 [α=0·025]). Differences between study groups attenuated after the interventions ended. INTERPRETATION: A targeted self-help intervention with high potential for dissemination could be efficacious in promoting smoking cessation among dual users of combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes.

Public health,"Vaping among adults in England who have never regularly smoked: a population-based study, 2016-24.","BACKGROUND: E-cigarettes are increasingly used by smokers and ex-smokers, often to support smoking cessation, but also among those who have never regularly smoked. The aim of our study is to estimate time trends in vaping prevalence among adults who have never regularly smoked and describe the profile of adult never-regular-smokers who vape. METHODS: In this nationally representative, monthly cross-sectional survey in England, 153 073 participants (aged ≥18 years) were recruited from July, 2016, to April, 2024. 94 107 (61·5%) of the 153 073 participants had never regularly smoked. Logistic regression estimated associations between survey wave and current vaping, overall, and by sociodemographic characteristics and alcohol consumption. FINDINGS: Vaping prevalence among never-regular-smokers was relatively stable up to 2021, at an average of 0·5% (95% CI 0·5-0·6) between July, 2016, and December, 2020; it then increased rapidly, reaching 3·5% (2·8-4·4) in April, 2024. This increase was largely driven by young adults (19·0% [13·9-25·4] among individuals aged 18 years) and those with higher alcohol consumption levels (22·1% [11·7-37·8%] among the heaviest drinkers). By contrast, trends among all adults (including current and former smokers) suggested the rise in vaping prevalence plateaued among all ages by early 2023. In 2023-24, 55·6% (48·2-62·8) of never-regular-smokers who vaped reported vaping daily; 81·7% (75·4-86·7) had been vaping for 6 months or more. The most used devices in 2023-24 were disposables (50·2% [42·9-57·5]) and the most commonly used e-liquids contained 20 mg/mL or more nicotine (44·6% [37·4-52·0]). INTERPRETATION: The number of adults in England who vape but have never regularly smoked rose rapidly between 2021 and 2024, particularly in younger age groups and most of these individuals reported vaping regularly over a sustained period. The public health impacts of this finding will depend on what these people would otherwise be doing: it is likely that some might have smoked if vaping were not an available option (exposing them to more harm), whereas others might not have smoked or vaped.

Public health,"Oral nicotine pouch use in Great Britain: a repeat cross-sectional study, 2020-25.","BACKGROUND: Global oral nicotine pouch sales have grown rapidly in recent years, but population-level patterns of use remain poorly described. The aim of this study is to examine recent trends in nicotine pouch use in Great Britain. METHODS: We used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, a representative monthly cross-sectional survey of tobacco and nicotine use in Great Britain, collected between October, 2020, and March, 2025 (recruiting around 2450 participants per month). Participants were aged 16 years or older (16-17-year-olds included from January, 2022). Nicotine pouch use was self-reported through questions on current use of various nicotine and tobacco products. We estimated trends in the prevalence of current nicotine pouch use, overall and stratified by sociodemographic characteristics and other nicotine product use, as well as trends in the use of pouches to aid quitting smoking. All reported percentages are survey-weighted. FINDINGS: A total of 127 793 individuals were included in this study. Among adults, nicotine pouch use increased from 0·1% (95% CI 0·1-0·2) in October, 2020, to 1·0% (0·8-1·2) in March, 2025. From 2022, increases were concentrated among young people: in 16-24-year-olds, use rose from 0·7% (0·4-1·4) in January, 2022, to 4·0% (2·9-5·5) in March, 2025, with no meaningful change in those aged 35 years and older. Use was higher among men, especially 16-24-year-old men (7·5%, 6·0-9·4 in March, 2025) and those who smoke or vape, but similar across nations and social grades. Among people using pouches surveyed from January, 2022, to March, 2025, 69% (95% CI 65-74) also used other nicotine products; 56% (52-61) smoked, 39% (34-44) vaped, and 16% (12-19) had never smoked regularly. Among people who attempted to quit smoking in the past year, the proportion using pouches in their most recent quit attempt rose from 2·6% (1·0-6·6) in October, 2020, to 6·5% (4·8-8·8) in March, 2025. INTERPRETATION: Nicotine pouch use has risen in Great Britain, primarily driven by sharp increases among young people, especially young men. Most users also smoked or vaped, and a growing proportion of smokers used pouches in attempts to quit smoking. These findings underscore the importance of implementing age-of-sale legislation for nicotine pouches and conducting research on their effectiveness for smoking cessation.

Sleep disturbance may be one important side effect, but understanding sleep disturbance effects on smoking cessation is complicated by the fact that nicotine withdrawal also produces sleep disturbance. AIMS: To evaluate the effects of withdrawal and treatment side effects on sleep disturbance. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial (Lerman et al., 2015) of 1,136 smokers randomised to placebo (n = 363), transdermal nicotine (TN; n = 381), or varenicline (n = 392) and stratified based on NMR (559 slow metabolisers; 577 normal metabolisers). Sleep disturbance was assessed at baseline and at 1-week following the target quit date (TQD). We also examined whether sleep disturbance predicted 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at end-of-treatment (EOT). RESULTS: The varenicline and TN groups exhibited greater increases in sleep disturbance (vs. placebo; treatment × time interaction; p = 0.005), particularly among those who quit smoking at 1-week post-TQD. There was a main effect of NMR (p = 0.04), but no interactions with treatment. TN and varenicline attenuated withdrawal symptoms unrelated to sleep (vs. placebo). Greater baseline sleep disturbance predicted relapse at EOT (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Existing treatments may not mitigate withdrawal-related sleep disturbance and adjunctive treatments that target sleep disturbance may improve abstinence rates.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

AIMS: The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of two separate, sequential interventions to promote tobacco cessation/reduction compared to standard care in smokers considered high-risk for lung cancer. METHODS: The study will recruit 276 current smokers attending a lung cancer screening clinic or considered high-risk for lung cancer based on age and smoking history across two sites. Patients first will be randomized to either standard tobacco treatment (8 weeks of nicotine patch and five individual counselling sessions) or standard tobacco treatment plus personalized gain-framed messaging. At the 8-week visit, all patients will be re-randomized to receive biomarker feedback or no biomarker feedback. Repeated assessments during treatment will be used to evaluate changes in novel biomarkers: skin carotenoids, lung function, and plasma bilirubin that will be used for biomarker feedback. We hypothesize that personalized gain-framed messages and receiving biomarker feedback related to tobacco cessation/reduction will improve quit rates and prevent relapse compared to standard care. Primary outcomes include 7-day point-prevalence abstinence verified with expired carbon monoxide at 8 weeks and mean cigarettes per day in the past week at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings will inform the development of novel interventions for patients at risk for lung cancer to improve smoking cessation rates.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

This ambiguity could reflect, in part, the potential for confounding of observed associations by genetic and environmental factors, which previous research has been unable to rigorously rule out. We used data from the prospective, population-based Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (n = 18,234 born 1994-2001) and applied a co-twin control design to account for potential genetic and environmental confounding of sports participation, physical activity, and friendship quality (assessed at age 15) as presumed protective factors for adolescent substance use and self-harm behavior (assessed at age 18). While confidence intervals widened to include the null in numerous co-twin control analyses adjusting for childhood psychopathology, parent-reported sports participation and twin-reported positive friendship quality were associated with increased odds of alcohol problems and nicotine use. However, parent-reported sports participation, twin-reported physical activity, and twin-reported friendship quality were associated with decreased odds of self-harm behavior. The findings provide a more nuanced understanding of the risks and benefits of putative protective factors for risky behaviors that emerge during adolescence.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Some electronic cigarettes are marketed in the United Kingdom as 'electronic shisha' (e-shisha). This study aimed to understand how WTS users view e-shisha and whether it could be used as a harm-reduction or cessation aid. METHOD: In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with 16 young adults recruited by snowball sampling in London, UK. Recurrent themes were derived iteratively through thematic analysis. RESULTS: WTS is a socially acceptable activity, carried out at home or in a café. Peer influence and flavour play a key role in its use. Participants were aware of some health risks of WTS, although many accepted this risk and reported a need for more health-related WTS information. Although participants were familiar with e-shisha, there was no evidence of its use as a harm-reduction or cessation product. E-shisha tasted different to flavoured waterpipe tobacco and removed the positive social attributes typically ascribed to WTS. Waterpipe users felt e-shisha may encourage non-users to initiate cigarettes or WTS. CONCLUSION: Opinions of reduced risk in using WTS may be due to the lack of available information, misconceptions and its easy accessibility. E-shisha does not appear to play a role in WTS harm reduction or cessation. On-going research efforts should test educational interventions addressing the adverse health impacts of WTS in this population group.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Herein, it is shown that nicotine could quench the cathodic electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) with high efficiency. The ECL quenching mechanism of nicotine was studied in detail using various experimental tools and theoretical calculations. It was concluded that the strongly oxidizing intermediate SO4•-, produced from K2S2O8, could oxidized nicotine, resulting in ECL emission quenching. On the basis of this high-efficiency ECL quenching of the AuNCs/K2S2O8 system, a recyclable, ultrasensitive, and selective ECL sensing platform for nicotine detection was proposed. Even in the absence of any complex signal amplification techniques, the ECL sensor for nicotine detection showed an unprecedentedly low detection limit of 7.0 × 10-13 M (S/N = 3) and a wide linear range over 8 orders of magnitude. Most remarkably, it could be successfully used for nicotine detection in human urine samples. This is expected to promote the investigations and applications on nicotine-related diseases. We believe that the proposed ECL platform can hold great prospects for commercialization in biomedical fields and tobacco industries.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This analysis allowed us to propose specific correlations between flavoring chemicals and aerosol toxicants. A literature search was conducted in November 2019 using PubMed. Keywords included terms related to ECIGs and flavors. Studies were included if they reported chemical ingredients of flavored liquids and clearly stated the commercial names of these liquids. The obtained data were visualized on a network diagram to show the common chemical compounds identified in flavored ECIG liquids and categorize them into different chemical classes. The systematic literature review included a total of 11 articles. Analysis of the data reported gave a total of 189 flavored liquids and 173 distinct chemical compounds that were categorized into 22 chemical classes according to their functional groups. The subsequent prediction of chemical transformations of these functional groups highlighted the possible correlation of flavor compounds to aerosol toxicants.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We conducted a systematic literature review of the available analytical methods to detect the nicotine enantiomer ratio and the source of nicotine using PubMed and Web of Science databases. Methods to detect nicotine enantiomers included polarimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and gas and liquid chromatography. We also covered methods developed to detect the source of nicotine either indirectly via determining the nicotine enantiomer ratio or the detection of tobacco-specific impurities or directly using the isotope ratio enrichment analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance (site-specific natural isotope fractionation and site-specific peak intensity ratio) or accelerated mass spectrometry.

We found that ΔTmax and CC emissions varied widely, with greater ΔTmax resulting in exponentially higher CC emissions. Also, 12% of atomizers accounted for 85% of total formaldehyde emissions.

There are limited data on levels of such constituents in SLT products used in Africa, a region with high prevalence of SLT use and the associated morbidity and mortality. Manufactured and custom-made SLT products were purchased from five African countries (South Africa, Uganda, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Zambia) using a standard approach for sample collection, labeling, and storage. Moisture content, pH, total and unprotonated (biologically available) nicotine, five tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNA), 10 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), five metals and metalloids (As, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb), nitrate, and nitrite were analyzed. A total of 54 samples representing 15 varieties of manufactured SLT products and 13 varieties of custom-made SLT products were purchased and analyzed. In all samples, the total nicotine ranged from 1.6 to 20.5 mg/g product and unprotonated nicotine accounted for 5.3-99.6% of the total nicotine content. The sum of all five TSNA ranged from 1.6 to 100 μg/g product, with significant within-country variations observed across both the manufactured and custom-made varieties. Significant variations were also found for PAH, metals and metalloids, nitrates, and nitrites. This is the most comprehensive report on the chemical profiling of products from African countries. This is also the first study illustrating the variability of harmful constituents within the same types and brands of African SLT. Our findings emphasize the need for consumer education and interventions to reduce SLT use in Africa. The data reported here can be useful to regulators in considering measures to prevent the occurrence of high levels of known toxicants and carcinogens in manufactured products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Subtle differences in the design or construction of aftermarket pods may intrinsically modify the performance of the ENDS device and the resulting nicotine and toxicant emissions relative to the original equipment manufacturer's product. In this study, we examined the electrical output of a JUUL battery and the aerosol emissions when four different brands of aftermarket pods filled with an analytical-grade mixture of propylene glycol, glycerol, and nicotine were attached to it and puffed by machine. The aerosol emissions examined included total particulate matter (TPM), nicotine, carbonyl compounds (CCs), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). We also compared the puff-resolved power and TPM outputs of JUUL and aftermarket pods. We found that all aftermarket pods drew significantly greater electrical power from the JUUL battery during puffing and had different electrical resistances and resistivity. In addition, unlike the case with the original pods, we found that with the aftermarket pods, the power provided by the battery did not vary greatly with flow rate or puff number, suggesting impairment of the temperature control circuitry of the JUUL device when used with the aftermarket pods. The greater power output with the aftermarket pods resulted in up to three times greater aerosol and nicotine output than the original product. ROS and CC emissions varied widely across brands. These results highlight that the use of aftermarket pods can greatly modify the performance and emissions of ENDS. Consumers and public health authorities should be made aware of the potential increase in the level of toxicant exposure when aftermarket pods are employed.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We describe an experimental approach for examining systemic nicotine intake, looking at individual variability, comparing JUUL electronic cigarettes and cigarette smoking, and comparing standardized puffing and ad libitum use. Fourteen cigarette smokers who were infrequent e-cigarette users vaped JUUL or smoked cigarettes, both in a standardized session (ten 3.5 s puffs over 5 min) and in a 4 h ad libitum use session. Plasma nicotine concentrations were measured, and using sex and body weight-based population nicotine clearance predictions, systemic nicotine dose was estimated in each session. The pharmacokinetically (PK)-estimated nicotine dose in the standardized session averaged 0.55 mg (range 0.16-0.82) for JUUL and 1.15 mg (range 0.35-4.56) for cigarette smoking. The PK-estimated dose with ad libitum use averaged 4.1 mg (range 0.4-9.5) for JUUL and 5.0 mg (range 1.5-15) for smoking (average 3.4 cigarettes). Within individual correlations, comparing PK-estimated dose for JUUL use with standardized vs ad libitum session was weak (r = 0.45, NS) but was much stronger for cigarette smoking (r = 0.82, p < 0.001). Data from ad libitum use predicted that consumption of the liquid contained in a JUUL pod would correspond to smoking 15 cigarettes, which is similar to that observed in real world studies. We conclude that standardized vaping sessions do not predict usual nicotine self-administration behavior with ad libitum use. With ad libitum use, nicotine intake is much more similar to vaping and smoking and provides a much better predictor of product delivery in the real world. This approach is recommended for screening of novel inhaled nicotine devices and to aid FDA regulatory decision making.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

NNN and NNK are classified by IARC as carcinogenic to humans.7 TSNAs transfer from tobacco to smoke by evaporation driven by heat and the flow of gases down the cigarette rod. Other TSNA sources in smoke include pyrorelease, where room temperature-unextractable TSNAs are released by smoking, and pyrosynthesis, where TSNAs are formed by reactions during smoking. We propose the first model that quantifies these three sources of TSNA in smoke. In our model, evaporative transfer efficiency of a TSNA is equated to the evaporative transfer efficiency of nicotine. Smoke TSNA measured in excess of what is transferred by evaporation is termed ""pyrogeneration,"" which is the net sum of pyrorelease and pyrosynthesis minus pyrodegredation. This model requires no internal standard, is applicable to commercial cigarettes ""as is,"" and uses existing analytical methods. This model was applied to archived Philip Morris USA data. For commercial blended cigarettes, NNN pyrogeneration appears to be unimportant, but NNK pyrogeneration contributes roughly 30-70% of NNK in smoke with the greater contribution at lower tobacco NNK levels. This means there is an opportunity to significantly reduce smoke NNK by up to 70% if pyrogeneration can be decreased or eliminated, perhaps by finding a way to grow and cure tobacco with reduced matrix-bound NNK. For burley research cigarettes, pyrogeneration may account for 90% or more of both NNN and NNK in smoke.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Altria'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Aldehydes are one of the chemical classes on the TobReg smoke toxicants priority list. To provide insight in factors determining aldehyde yields, the levels of 12 aldehydes in mainstream cigarette smoke of 11 Dutch brands were quantified. Variations in smoking behavior and cigarette design affecting human exposure to aldehydes were studied by using four different machine testing protocols. Machine smoking was based on the International Standardization Organization (ISO) and Health Canada Intense (HCI) regime, both with and without taping the filter vents. The 11 cigarette brands differed in (i) design and blend characteristics; (ii) tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide (TNCO) levels; (iii) popularity; and (iv) manufacturer. Cigarette smoke was trapped on a Cambridge filter pad and carboxen cartridge. After being dissolved in methanol/CS2 and derivatization with DNPH, the aldehyde yields were determined using HPLC-DAD. Using an intense smoking regime (increased puff volume, shorter puff interval) significantly increased aldehyde yields, following the pattern: ISO < ISO-taped < HCI-untaped < HCI. For all of the regimes, acetaldehyde and acrolein yields were strongly correlated ( r = 0.804). The difference in TNCO and aldehyde levels between regular and highly ventilated low-TNCO cigarettes (as measured using ISO) diminished when smoking intensely; this effect is stronger when combined with taping filter vents. The highly ventilated low-TNCO brands showed six times more aldehyde production per mg nicotine for the intense smoking regimes. In conclusion, acetaldehyde and acrolein can be used as representatives for the class of volatile aldehydes for the different brands and smoking regimes. The aldehyde-to-nicotine ratio increased when highly ventilated cigarettes were smoked intensely, similar to real smokers. Thus, a smoker of highly ventilated low-TNCO cigarettes has an increased potential for higher aldehyde exposures compared to a smoker of regular cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

With this motivation, we have used a drug molecule, nicotine, having N-heterocyclic functionality as the initiator for the synthesis of PLLA conjugates. Structural characterizations carried out using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared, and NMR establish the reacting species during polymerization in the absence of any side reactions. However, side reactions occurred because of the absence of steric hindrance when polymerization is initiated using nicotine in the presence of benzyl alcohol. Accordingly, we report here a detailed investigation on the mechanism of nicotine as an initiator and propose an anionic-based mechanism for the ROP of LLA. Studies on the kinetics parameters have been performed for the nicotine-initiated ROP of LLA and have found that polymerization proceeds with a first-order dependence on both the monomer and initiator concentrations with a low activation energy of 4.9 kcal·mol-1. Further, thermal release studies performed by hyphenated thermogravimetric-Fourier transform infrared analysis found that nicotine is released along with reduced toxins from these synthesized PLLA-nicotine conjugates. Thus, these PLLA-nicotine conjugates can in turn open up a new era in tobacco industries for the preparation of synthetic cigarettes and also in biomedical applications for drug delivery purposes. Herein, a few preliminary experiments using another drug molecule, nicorandil, having similar N-heterocyclic functionality were also conducted to support the role of nicotine as an initiator for the synthesis of PLLA conjugates.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Nevertheless, there are still harmful effects associated with chemicals emitted from E-cig. Identifying the sources of the emitted compounds can be challenging because of the differences in the design of E-cig devices and the variability in the composition of E-cig liquids used in these devices. In this study, the emission profiles from impurity-free E-liquids containing only propylene glycol and glycerol in various percentage ratios along with two commercially available E-liquids were evaluated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This study approach allows the elucidation of the transformation pathways of the major emitted compounds without the confounding effects of existing impurities or flavor ingredients added to E-liquids. Analysis of the vapor phases of E-cig emissions detected toxicants such as acetaldehyde, acrolein, benzaldehyde, as well as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) compounds. The amount of glycerol in the E-liquids has a major effect on the concentration of these hazardous compounds emitted because the concentration of these chemicals increased with increasing glycerol percentage in the E-liquid. Acetaldehyde and acrolein increased by 175-fold and 28-fold, respectively, when the glycerol composition was increased from 0 to 80%. Benzaldehyde, naphthalene, diphenyl ether, and glycerol along with menthol and nicotine that were present in the commercial E-liquids were also detected in the aerosol condensates. The cascade impactor data on the distribution of the nicotine and menthol in different size fractions from >2.5 to <2.5 μm allow the estimates of the extent of toxicant deposition in different parts of the pulmonary system including the oropharynx region, the trachea as well as inside the alveoli and bronchioles. In summary, users of E-cig are exposed to harmful chemicals even if the E-liquids contain only propylene glycol and glycerol without flavorings, nicotine, or impurities. Furthermore, this study shows that E-liquids containing higher percentages of glycerol will produce higher levels of toxicants compared to E-liquids with similar percentages of propylene glycol. This finding has important implications to E-cigarette vendors and manufacturers, consumers, and regulatory agencies.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The particles are largely liquid droplets containing a wide variety of condensed organic compounds. Each compound in the smoke will partition between the gas and PM phases and will always seek a state of gas/particle equilibrium. When tobacco smoke is inhaled, a compound such as nicotine can deposit in the respiratory tract (RT) by four different mechanisms: (1) direct gas deposition (DGD) of the portion of the compound that is initially in the gas phase of the inhaled smoke; (2) evaporative gas deposition (EGD) of PM-phase compound by evaporation to the gas phase, then deposition; (3) particle deposition, evaporation from the deposited particle, then deposition from the gas phase (PDE); and (4) particle deposition with diffusion (PDD) into RT tissue. Three of the mechanisms (DGD, EGD, and PDE) involve volatilization from the PM phase. The relative importance of all the mechanisms is therefore greatly affected by the volatility of the compound from the PM phase as it is set by the compound's gas/particle partitioning constant K(p) through the compound's vapor pressure. For a largely nonvolatile compound such as benzo[a]pyrene, only PDD will likely be important. For a semivolatile compound such as nicotine, all four mechanisms can be important. Because tobacco smoke alkaloids such as nicotine can exist in protonated as well as free-base form, the fraction alpha(fb) of the compound that is in the neutral free-base form in the PM phase plays a critical, pH-dependent role in determining the relative importance of the four mechanisms. Equations are developed that can be used to ascertain the importance of the DGD and EGD mechanisms. The value of alpha(fb) for nicotine in a tobacco smoke PM is set by pH(eff), the effective pH of the PM phase. Historically, a primary method for measuring ""smoke pH"" has involved the direct exposure of a pH electrode to tobacco smoke. This method cannot yield direct insight into pH(eff) or alpha(fb) values because (1) problems exist in using such an electrode to measure smoke PM-phase pH, and (2) by itself, a measurement of the pH of tobacco smoke PM says nothing about the effects of PM-phase activity coefficients of protonated and free-base nicotine on the nicotine species distribution. The ""acidic"" values that have typically been measured for cigarette ""smoke pH"" by the direct pH electrode method are therefore neither reliable nor useful in determining the relative distribution of PM-phase nicotine among the protonated and free-base forms. The dependence of the volatility of nicotine from tobacco smoke PM on alpha(fb) means that measuring the gas/particle distribution of nicotine under equilibrium conditions in a tobacco smoke by denuder samplers (or by another method) can yield information about the nicotine K(p) for that smoke. Knowledge of K(p,fb), the partitioning constant for nicotine in the free-base form, then allows calculation of alpha(fb) through the relation K(p) = K(p,fb)/alpha(fb). The available data suggest that the smoke PM from some commercial cigarettes can be characterized by alpha(fb) > or = 0.4, i.e., 40% or more of the nicotine in the free-base form. This conclusion is consistent with (1) the gas-sampling denuder results obtained by Philip Morris in which significant tobacco smoke nicotine was observed to deposit in acid-coated denuder tubes, with more depositing when the cigarette tobacco blend was treated with ammonia; (2) the view that the sensory ""impact"" exhibited by some tobacco smokes is caused by the deposition of gaseous nicotine in the pharynx; (3) the observed throat irritation caused by nicotine inhalers; and (4) the high overall respiratory tract deposition efficiencies for nicotine of 0.9 and greater that have been reported for some cigarette smokes. The available information combines to create a picture of nicotine in cigarette smoke that contradicts the traditional view that cigarette smoke PM is typically acidic, with little free-base nicotine typically present in the smoke PM phase. Government agencies interested in establishing a framework for the testing and monitoring of nicotine delivery may wish to consider requiring the measurement and publication of the PM-phase alpha(fb) values for the cigars and cigarettes marketed in their jurisdictions.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Nicotine can exist in protonated and free base forms in the smoke PM, and alpha(fb) is the fraction of the PM nicotine that is in the free base form. Because only the free base form can volatilize from the smoke PM phase to the gas phase of an inhaled aerosol and because gaseous nicotine deposits rapidly in the respiratory tract (RT), the magnitude and rate of nicotine deposition in the RT will depend on alpha(fb). The types of values that alpha(fb) can assume in the PM of cigarette smoke aerosols have not been well-known. The conventional view has been that mainstream cigarette smoke PM contains relatively little free base nicotine so that the cigarette smoker must absorb nicotine mostly from deposited particles. A prior study concluded that because cigarette smoke is at ""pH 5.3"", there is very little free base nicotine in such smoke. A 1994 internal tobacco company document discusses the view that ""smoke pH"" values for cigarette smoke are ""approximately 6.0"". This work uses volatility-based measurements to provide determinations of equilibrium nicotine alpha(fb) values for mainstream smoke PM from selected cigarettes. The effective pH (i.e., pH(eff)) of the smoke PM from selected brands of commercial cigarettes was found to span a range of 6.0-7.8 (nicotine alpha(fb) = 0.01-0.36), with all pH(eff) values much larger than 5.3 and most larger than 6.0.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

There were 622 participants from the United States (US) and Poland, and of these, 70% were smokers. All subjects provided spot urine samples, and 125 smokers provided blood samples. Urinary PAH metabolite half-lives were determined in 8 smokers. In controlled hospital studies of 18 smokers, the associations between various measures of nicotine intake and urinary excretion of PAH metabolites were investigated. Plasma nicotine was measured by GC. LC-MS/MS was used to measure the plasma levels of cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, and urine levels of nicotine and its metabolites, total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) and PAH metabolites (2-naphthol, 1-, 2-, and 3-hydroxyfluorenes, 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxyphenanthrenes, and 1-hydroxypyrene). Regardless of smoking status, PAH metabolite excretion was higher in Polish subjects than in US subjects (p-values <0.001). 1-Hydroxyfluorene exhibited the greatest difference between smokers and nonsmokers, with a 5-fold difference in Polish subjects and a 25-fold difference in US subjects, followed by 3- and 2-hydroxyfluorenes, 2-naphthol, and 1-hydroxypyrene. The differences for hydroxyphenanthrenes were small or nonsignificant. 1-Hydroxyfluorene had the highest correlation with urine nicotine equivalents (r = 0.77) and urine NNAL (r = 0.64). While the half-lives of PAH metabolites were <10 h in smokers, 1-hydroxyfluorene had the largest ratio of initial to terminal urine concentration (58.4 ± 38.6, mean ± SD) after smoking. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis of PAHs among Polish and US subjects further showed that hydroxyfluorenes are most highly discriminative of smokers from nonsmokers followed by 2-naphthol and 1-hydroxypyrene. In conclusion, hydroxyfluorenes, particularly 1-hydroxyfluorene, and 2-naphthol are more selective of tobacco smoke than 1-hydroxypyrene and hydroxyphenanthrenes. Characterization of hydroxyfluorene and 2-naphthol metabolites in urine may improve the characterization of PAHs from tobacco smoke and related disease risks among smokers and nonsmokers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Smoking such cigarettes was seen as a means of reducing the harm caused by smoking, but not as offering a 'safe' smoking option. Correspondingly manufacturers have been required to place tar and nicotine information on packet labels and/or advertisements. This paper explores the possibility that the conventional format for conveying tar and nicotine information could be responsible for the belief, held by a significant proportion of smokers, that some brands of lower tar cigarettes are absolutely 'safe'. To deal with this situation it is suggested that changes should be made to health warnings, and tar and nicotine communications. Proposed changes to the latter are evaluated in terms of their ethical and public health implications. The authors conclude that brand specific warnings and a classification of cigarettes as either 'Very Dangerous' or 'Dangerous', is best suited to reconciling consumer needs for information with the public health objectives of reducing the harm caused by smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The focus is on the contributions of many behavioral pharmacology researchers who collaborated very much in the spirit of an interactive community dedicated to the common cause of advancing science in service of public health. Division 28 and its members hold a prominent place in this account because, throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Division was the lead scientific forum for bringing together researchers addressing the behavioral pharmacology of tobacco and nicotine. The commentary provides an overview of how advances utilizing animal and human models of dependence and withdrawal came to inform public health policy and more recently, tobacco product regulation. The commentary also recounts how efforts by the tobacco industry collided with those of nonindustry researchers, including Division 28 members, and how this was taken up in congressional hearings that addressed behavioral pharmacology research on tobacco. The review concludes with an overview of current challenges to behavioral pharmacology researchers to assist in guiding the regulation of tobacco products by the United States Food and Drug Administration and other national regulatory authorities, as well as guiding the implementation of the international tobacco treaty-the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

However, it is possible that product marketing may suggest reduced risk to individuals. This study examines perceptions, in particular those related to harm and addiction, of snus print advertisements using a combination of eye-tracking, survey, and semistructured interviews. Participants were 22 male smokers ages 19-29 (M = 26.64, SD = 2.92). Five snus advertisements were each displayed for 20 s and eye movements were tracked. Participants responded to questions about harm and addiction after each advertisement and interviews were conducted after seeing all advertisements. For each advertisement, descriptive statistics were calculated and regression analyses predicted harm and addiction perceptions from eye tracking areas of interest (e.g., warning label). Qualitative data were analyzed using inductive/deductive thematic analysis. For certain advertisements, areas of interest were significantly associated with harm and/or addiction perceptions. For example, higher total fixation duration on the graphic in the Smokeless for Smokers advertisement was associated with decreased perceptions of addiction (B = -.360, p = .048). Qualitative themes emerged and in many instances corroborated quantitative results. This study indicates that for some advertisements, attention on certain areas (measured through eye tracking) is associated with perceptions among young male smokers. Understanding how smokers perceive and understand products after viewing advertisements may inform regulations regarding claims about product harm and addiction and may guide public health efforts to educate smokers on the risks of emerging products.

Conditions differed by liquid nicotine concentration: 0, 8, 18, or 36 mg/ml. Participants' plasma nicotine concentration was directly related to liquid nicotine concentration and dependent on user experience, with significantly higher mean plasma nicotine increases observed in ECIG-experienced individuals relative to ECIG-naïve smokers in each active nicotine condition. When using 36 mg/ml, mean plasma nicotine increase for ECIG-experienced individuals was 17.9 ng/ml (SD = 17.2) and 6.9 (SD = 7.1; p < .05) for ECIG-naïve individuals. Between-group differences were likely due to longer puffs taken by experienced ECIG users: collapsed across condition, mean puff duration was 5.6 sec (SD = 3.0) for ECIG-experienced and 2.9 (SD = 1.5) for ECIG-naïve individuals. ECIG use also suppressed nicotine/tobacco abstinence symptoms in both groups; the magnitude of abstinence symptom suppression depended on liquid nicotine concentration and user experience. These and other recent results suggest that policies intended to limit ECIG nicotine delivery will need to account for factors in addition to liquid nicotine concentration (e.g., device power and user behavior).

One class of ECIGs includes ""sub-ohm"" devices that incorporate heating coils with resistance less than 1 ohm (Ω), lower than that observed in conventional devices (e.g., ≥1.5 Ω). Relative to conventional ECIGs that operate at ≤10 W, low-resistance coils can be used to increase device power (e.g., 40-300 W). However, little is known about the individual and combined effects of ECIG power, manipulated by coil resistance, and liquid nicotine concentration on ECIG acute effects. Experienced ECIG users (N = 32) completed 4 sessions that differed by ECIG power and coil resistance (40.5 W, 0.5 Ω or 13.5 W, 1.5 Ω) and liquid nicotine concentration (3 or 8 mg/ml). In each session, participants used a 4.5-V Kanger SUBOX ECIG in a 10-puff directed and 60-min ad libitum bout. Nicotine delivery, heart rate, subjective effects, puff topography, and liquid consumption were measured. Nicotine delivery was greatest in the 8mg/ml+0.5Ω condition and lowest in the 3mg/ml+1.5Ω condition. The greatest reduction in abstinence symptoms were observed in the 8mg/ml+0.5Ω condition, although the highest ratings for satisfaction and liking were reported in the 3mg/ml+0.5Ω condition. Use of ECIGs containing 3 mg/ml nicotine liquid resulted in longer and larger puffs and increased puff frequency, though high-power/low-resistance ECIGs resulted in greater consumption of ECIG liquid. ECIG device and liquid characteristics and user puff topography should be considered simultaneously when making regulatory decisions aimed at protecting public health.

This review synthesizes available data on ONPs in key research domains including survey studies, marketing/advertising studies, chemical characterization and in vitro studies, and clinical studies. Research findings relevant for ONP regulations are summarized, including who uses these products and why, how marketing tactics influence appeal and use intentions, what harmful and potentially harmful constituents they contain, and what acute effects they have on humans. Taken together, the current data suggest that ONPs likely produce less harm to individual users than conventional tobacco products (e.g., moist snuff, cigarettes) and can acutely suppress nicotine/tobacco withdrawal symptoms among current cigarette smokers. Thus, ONPs may be a viable harm reduction option for individuals who switch completely to using them from conventional products. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to determine if established tobacco users would use ONPs long term, and more independent academic research is needed given that most ONP studies to date are tobacco industry-funded. Additionally, ONPs have qualities (e.g., flavors, marketing claims of ""tobacco free"") that could increase appeal among youth and young adults, and these products can deliver nicotine at levels sufficient to cause dependence; widespread adoption of ONPs among otherwise nicotine-naive individuals may reduce their net public health benefit. This review concludes by suggesting future research directions necessary to increase scientific understanding of ONPs and inform regulations for these increasingly popular products.

Serial plasma nicotine concentrations and subjective and cardiovascular effects were measured, and genetic variation in the CYP2A6 gene, encoding the primary enzyme responsible for nicotine metabolism, was assessed.

To determine whether DNM1 is associated with ND, in this study, we genotyped seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this gene in 602 nuclear families of either African-American (AA) or European-American (EA) origin. Individual SNP-based association analysis revealed a significant association of SNP rs3003609 with smoking quantity (SQ; P=0.0031) and Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI; P=0.0042) in the EA sample. Furthermore, our haplotype-based association analyses indicated that haplotypes T-G-T, formed by rs2502731-rs2229917-rs3003609 (at a frequency of 54%), G-T-A, formed by rs2229917-rs3003609-rs16930313 (at a frequency of 52%), and T-A-G, formed by rs3003609-rs16930313-rs7022174 (at a frequency of 52%) are significantly associated with SQ (Z=-2.44 to -2.92; P=0.015-0.0055) and HSI (Z=-2.52 to -2.67; P=0.012-0.0076) in the EA sample. In the AA sample, another haplotype, G-T-A, formed by rs7875406-rs2502731-rs2229917, at a frequency of 12% was significantly associated with SQ (Z=-2.58; P=0.0098). Finally, by using in vitro gene expression assays, we demonstrated that the T allele of rs3003609 in the exon 9 of DNM1 significantly decreases the expression of DNM1, by 27.1% at the mRNA and 22.0% at the protein level, suggesting that rs3003609 represents a functional polymorphism affecting DNM1 expression and may partly contributed to the observed association of the gene with ND in our samples. Taken together, our findings indicate that DNM1 is likely involved in the etiology of ND and represents a plausible candidate for further investigation in independent samples.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

A total of 1123 SNPs at 55 autosomal candidate genes, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and genes involved in dopaminergic function, were tested for association to baseline FTND scores adjusted for age, depression, education, sex, and study site. SNP P-values were adjusted for the number of transmission models, the number of SNPs tested per candidate gene, and their intragenic correlation. DRD2, SLC6A3, and NR4A2 SNPs with adjusted P-values <0.10 were considered sufficiently noteworthy to justify further genetic, bioinformatic, and literature analyses. Each independent signal among the top-ranked SNPs accounted for approximately 1% of the FTND variance in this sample. The DRD2 SNP appears to represent a novel association with nicotine dependence. The SLC6A3 SNPs have previously been shown to be associated with SLC6A3 transcription or dopamine transporter density in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo. Analysis of SLC6A3 and NR4A2 SNPs identified a statistically significant gene-gene interaction (P=0.001), consistent with in vitro evidence that the NR4A2 protein product (NURR1) regulates SLC6A3 transcription.

Cardiology,Cardiovascular effects of electronic cigarettes.,"Cardiovascular safety is an important consideration in the debate on the benefits versus the risks of electronic cigarette (EC) use. EC emissions that might have adverse effects on cardiovascular health include nicotine, oxidants, aldehydes, particulates, and flavourants. To date, most of the cardiovascular effects of ECs demonstrated in humans are consistent with the known effects of nicotine. Pharmacological and toxicological studies support the biological plausibility that nicotine contributes to acute cardiovascular events and accelerated atherogenesis. However, epidemiological studies assessing Swedish smokeless tobacco, which exposes users to nicotine without combustion products, generally have not found an increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke among users, but suggest that nicotine might contribute to acute cardiovascular events, especially in those with underlying coronary heart disease. The effects of aldehydes, particulates, and flavourants derived from ECs on cardiovascular health have not been determined. Although ECs might pose some cardiovascular risk to users, particularly those with existing cardiovascular disease, the risk is thought to be less than that of cigarette smoking based on qualitative and quantitative comparisons of EC aerosol versus cigarette smoke constituents. The adoption of ECs rather than cigarette smoking might, therefore, result in an overall benefit for public health.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

One possible causal mechanism is differential intake of tobacco toxicants, but results across studies are inconsistent. Thus, we examined racial differences in biomarkers of toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in tobacco smoke. METHOD: We analyzed baseline data collected from 182 Black and 184 White adult smokers who participated in a randomized clinical trial in 2013-2014 at 10 sites across the United States. We examined differences in urinary levels of ten VOC metabolites, total nicotine equivalents (TNE), and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), controlling for covariates such as cigarettes per day (CPD), as well as differences in VOCs per TNE to assess the extent to which tobacco exposure, and not metabolic factors, accounted for racial differences. RESULTS: Concentration of metabolites of acrolein, acrylonitrile, ethylene oxide, and methylating agents were significantly higher in Blacks compared to Whites when controlled for covariates. Other than the metabolite of methylating agents, VOCs per TNE did not differ between Blacks and Whites. Concentrations of TNE/CPD and VOCs/CPD were significantly higher in Blacks. Menthol did not contribute to racial differences in VOC levels. CONCLUSIONS: For a given level of CPD, Black smokers likely take in higher levels of acrolein, acrylonitrile, and ethylene oxide than White smokers. Our findings are consistent with Blacks taking in more nicotine and toxicants per cigarette smoked, which may explain their elevated disease risk relative to other racial groups.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Nicotine clearance can be estimated using the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) (ratio of 3'hydroxycotinine/cotinine), but only in current smokers. Advancing the genomics of this highly heritable biomarker of CYP2A6, the main metabolic enzyme for nicotine, will also enable investigation of never and former smokers. We performed the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date of the NMR in European ancestry current smokers (n = 5185), found 1255 genome-wide significant variants, and replicated the chromosome 19 locus. Fine-mapping of chromosome 19 revealed 13 putatively causal variants, with nine of these being highly putatively causal and mapping to CYP2A6, MAP3K10, ADCK4, and CYP2B6. We also identified a putatively causal variant on chromosome 4 mapping to TMPRSS11E and demonstrated an association between TMPRSS11E variation and a UGT2B17 activity phenotype. Together the 14 putatively causal SNPs explained ~38% of NMR variation, a substantial increase from the ~20 to 30% previously explained. Our additional GWASs of nicotine intake biomarkers showed that cotinine and smoking intensity (cotinine/cigarettes per day (CPD)) shared chromosome 19 and chromosome 4 loci with the NMR, and that cotinine and a more accurate biomarker, cotinine + 3'hydroxycotinine, shared a chromosome 15 locus near CHRNA5 with CPD and Pack-Years (i.e., cumulative exposure). Understanding the genetic factors influencing smoking-related traits facilitates epidemiological studies of smoking and disease, as well as assists in optimizing smoking cessation support, which in turn will reduce the enormous personal and societal costs associated with smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

While these studies provide compelling evidence for the powerful subjective experience and prolonged therapeutic adaptations, the underlying molecular reasons for these robust and clinically meaningful improvements are still poorly understood. Preclinical studies assessing the targets and circuitry of the post-acute effects of classical psychedelics are ongoing. Current literature is split between a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR)-dependent or -independent signaling pathway, as researchers are attempting to harness the mechanisms behind the sustained post-acute therapeutically relevant effects. A combination of molecular, behavioral, and genetic techniques in neuropharmacology has begun to show promise for elucidating these mechanisms.

Common genetic variation in the CYP2A6 region is strongly associated with NMR in smokers. Here, we investigated this regional association in more detail. We evaluated the association of CYP2A6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and * alleles with NMR among African American smokers (N = 953) from two clinical trials of smoking cessation. Stepwise conditional analysis and Bayesian fine-mapping were undertaken. Putative causal variants were incorporated into an existing African ancestry-specific genetic risk score (GRS) for NMR, and the performance of the updated GRS was evaluated in both African American (n = 953) and European ancestry smokers (n = 933) from these clinical trials. Five independent associations with NMR in the CYP2A6 region were identified using stepwise conditional analysis, including the deletion variant CYP2A6*4 (beta = -0.90, p = 1.55 × 10-11). Six putative causal variants were identified using Bayesian fine-mapping (posterior probability, PP = 0.67), with the top causal configuration including CYP2A6*4, rs116670633, CYP2A6*9, rs28399451, rs8192720, and rs10853742 (PP = 0.09). Incorporating these putative causal variants into an existing ancestry-specific GRS resulted in comparable prediction of NMR within African American smokers, and improved trans-ancestry portability of the GRS to European smokers. Our findings suggest that both * alleles and SNPs underlie the association of the CYP2A6 region with NMR among African American smokers, identify a shortlist of variants that may causally influence nicotine clearance, and suggest that portability of GRSs across populations can be improved through inclusion of putative causal variants.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

More than a billion people smoke, and without major increases in cessation, at least half will die prematurely from tobacco-related complications. In addition, people who smoke have a significant reduction in their quality of life. Neurobiological findings have identified the mechanisms by which nicotine in tobacco affects the brain reward system and causes addiction. These brain changes contribute to the maintenance of nicotine or tobacco use despite knowledge of its negative consequences, a hallmark of addiction. Effective approaches to screen, prevent and treat tobacco use can be widely implemented to limit tobacco's effect on individuals and society. The effectiveness of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions in helping people quit smoking has been demonstrated. As the majority of people who smoke ultimately relapse, it is important to enhance the reach of available interventions and to continue to develop novel interventions. These efforts associated with innovative policy regulations (aimed at reducing nicotine content or eliminating tobacco products) have the potential to reduce the prevalence of tobacco and nicotine use and their enormous adverse impact on population health.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

In adjusted analysis, pharmacotherapy type was not associated with NMR status, but normal metabolisers were less likely to use group support (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.51-0.89). NMR status does not vary substantially across sociodemographic characteristics. Given its impact on pharmacotherapy efficacy, the lack of an association with pharmacotherapy choice suggests there is scope to use NMR status to optimise the selection and efficacy of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy. The unexpected association of NMR status with behavioural support should be explored further.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The nicotine-based liquids are mainly composed by propylene glycol and glycerol playing the important role of airborne carriers. 1,3 propanediol is proposed as a propylene glycol substitute to potentially improve the thermal stability, nicotine delivery and to decrease inhaled flavors concentrations. We have implemented various thermal, physicochemical and computational methods to evaluate the use of 1,3 propanediol as a substitute (or additional ingredient) to propylene glycol in e-liquids compositions. Our results indicate that 1,3 propanediol is stable upon heating when electronic cigarette are used in recommended conditions. We demonstrate that 1,3 propanediol gave better thermic profile compared to propylene glycol and glycerol, showing less thermal decomposition by-products. In addition, 1,3 propanediol gives to nicotine a more basic environment ensuring a high level of free base nicotine form. We have also established a quantum mechanical based computational method to validate e-liquids as flavor enhancer. Our findings showed that globally 1,3 propanediol seems to have better flavoring properties than glycerol and propylene glycol. Finally, 1,3 propanediol seems to induce quite similar aerodynamic properties compared to propylene glycol and glycerol.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We compared electrical characteristics, liquid composition, and aerosol emissions of JUUL devices procured in the USA and the UK. Study outcomes included electrical power, total and freebase nicotine, propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin ratio, carbonyls, and reactive oxygen species.

To understand the effects of environmental factors (soil and climatic factors) on the yield and quality of flue-cured tobacco and determine the main regulating factors, we selected three flue-cured tobacco cultivars [K326, Yunyan87 (Yun87), and Honghuadajinyuan (Hongda)] grown in the Honghe Tobacco Zone. Indices related to yield and economic traits, chemical component properties, soil physical and chemical properties, and climatic factors at different planting sites, were evaluated. We used variance analysis, correlation analysis, and redundancy analysis (RDA) in this study. The results showed that the yield and chemical component properties of flue-cured tobacco, except for the number of left leaves and plant total sugar (PTS) content, were significantly correlated with climatic factors. Particularly, the yield increased in drier and sunnier weather. In terms of the carbon supply capacity, PTS, petroleum ether (PPE), and starch contents (PS) were higher under high-altitude and high-latitude climatic conditions, whereas for the nitrogen supply capacity, plant nitrogen (PTN) and nicotine (PN) contents improved under low-altitude and low-latitude climatic conditions. PTS, reducing sugar (PRS), potassium (PTK), chlorine (PCL), and PPE contents were negatively related to soil clay content, soil pH, and soil organic matter, whereas PRS and PTK contents were positively correlated with alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen (AN). According to RDA, the soil clay, AN, available phosphorus (AP), and soil chlorine content (SCL) strongly affected the quality of flue-cured tobacco. The quality of the K326 and Yun87 cultivars was mostly influenced by moisture, whereas the quality of the Hongda cultivar was mostly affected by temperature. In conclusion, compared with soil properties, climatic factors more significantly affect the yield and quality of Honghe flue-cured tobacco leaves.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Tobacco smoke is a main indoor source of NOx, but little information is available about their concentrations in second-hand smoke (SHS), particularly in small indoors. This study presents data of NOx and its main components nitric oxide (NO) and NO2 in SHS emitted by ten different cigarette brands measured in a closed test chamber with a volume of 2.88 m3, similar to the volume of vehicle cabins. The results show substantial increases in NOx concentrations when smoking only one cigarette. The NO2 mean concentrations ranged between 105 and 293 µg/m3, the NO2 peak concentrations between 126 and 357 µg/m3. That means the one-hour mean guideline of 200 µg/m3 for NO2 of the World Health Organization was exceeded up to 47%, respectively 79%. The measured NO2 values show positive correlations with the values for tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide stated by the cigarette manufacturers. This study provides NO2 concentrations in SHS at health hazard levels. These data give rise to the necessity of health authorities' measures to inform about and caution against NOx exposure by smoking in indoor rooms.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Nitrogen deficiency induced 6318 differentially expressed genes in both TN90 and TN86, which were highly expressed. In total, 428 upregulated genes were analysed and found to be mainly enriched in the MAPK signalling pathway, sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, and arginine and proline metabolism. Meanwhile, 213 downregulated genes were analysed and found to be mainly enriched in photosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, and amino acid biosynthesis.

The results showed that the total harmony scores (THS) of the analyzed tobacco leaves ranged from 46.55 ± 3.5 to 91.55 ± 2.25. Analyses of chemical components revealed that high contents of nicotine (≥ 1.06%) and sugar (total sugar: ≥ 22.96%, reducing sugar: ≥ 19.62%), as well as low potassium level (≤ 2.68%) were the main factors limiting the quality of flue-cured tobacco leaves. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that soil nitrate, available potassium/phosphorous, and organic matter significantly correlated with tobacco nicotine, potassium, and chloride levels (p < 0.05). Besides, the analysis of alpha- and beta-diversity of soil fungal communities implied that fungal structure rather than the richness affected the chemical quality of tobacco. In detail, the relative abundance of Humicola olivacea species in soils was positively correlated with the THS of tobaccos (r = 0.52, p < 0.05).

Median Tmax was significantly longer for the NRT (15.03 min) than for the tobacco products (4.05-6.03 min). Product liking and overall intent to use again was highest for the cigarette, and higher for the THPs than the NRT. Urge to smoke was reduced more by the cigarette than by the other three products.

While the relationship between maturity and physiological metabolic processes is acknowledged, a comprehensive understanding of the physiological behavior of cigar leaves harvested at different stages remains elusive. This research investigated the physiological and metabolomic profiles of the cigar tobacco variety CX-014, grown in Danjiangkou City, Hubei Province, with leaves sampled at 35 (T1), 42 (T2), 49 (T3), and 56 (T4) days post-inflorescence removal. Leaf color transitioned from green to yellow, accompanied by the appearance of white mature spots. Notable increases in photosynthetic pigments and gas exchange parameters occurred between T1 and T2, followed by decline at T3 and T4. The optimal sugar-to-nicotine and potassium-to-chlorine ratios, critical determinants of smoking quality and tobacco combustibility, were observed at T3, indicating a superior chemical balance in leaves harvested at this stage. Metabolomic analysis revealed 2153 distinct metabolites, with the most significant changes occurring between T2 and T3, highlighting critical physiological transformations during this interval. Pathway enrichment analysis via KEGG pinpointed notable shifts in amino acid synthesis pathways, particularly those involving tryptophan, alanine, and aspartate. Tryptophan metabolism and zeatin biosynthesis were substantially altered, with compounds like indolepyruvic acid, N-formylpurine nucleotide, isopentenyladenine nucleotide, and dihydrozeatin showing marked reductions at T3. This study also explored how the timing of lower leaf harvest influences the physiological processes of middle leaves, finding that a plethora of metabolites associated with the breakdown of arachidonic acid-a primitive metazoan signaler implicated in plant stress and defense networks-were abundant in T3 leaves when lower leaves were harvested 43-38 days prior.

Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to analyze the volatile aroma components in the CWLs. The results showed that the contents of substances such as Phenethyl alcohol, Dihydroactinidiolide, Sclareol, and Farnesyl acetone were significantly increased compared to pre-fermentation (NF) and the natural fermentation with only water (WF) group. Specifically, Phenethyl alcohol content increased by 261.63% compared to WF group during the same turning-over period, while Farnesyl acetone content increased by 144.99%.

Bitter metabolites in tobacco not only serve as protective agents in plants, but also significantly influence the overall flavor profile of cigarettes. In this study, we employed an integrated approach combining chemical profiling, cell-based calcium imaging assays, and molecular docking studies to identify key bitter compounds in cigarette smoke and explore the molecular mechanisms underlying their bitterness. We analyzed 22 commercial cigarette brands, revealing notable variability in bitterness perception. GC-MS analysis identified 88 compounds in mainstream cigarette smoke (MCS), with pyridines, esters, and phenols being the most prevalent. Using a TAS2R14-Gα16gust44-HEK293T cell-based assay, we objectively measured bitterness and identified nicotine, succinimide, and scopoletin as key bitter compounds through correlation analysis. Molecular docking studies provided detailed insights into the interactions of these compounds with the TAS2R14 receptor, highlighting significant hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. This integrated methodology not only identifies key contributors to cigarette bitterness but also enhances our understanding of the molecular basis of bitterness perception in tobacco. These findings pave the way for future studies to further elucidate the complex interactions of bitter compounds. This understanding of the links between tobacco bitterness and consumption holds significant implications for public health and tobacco control initiatives.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Data were from a representative household survey of adults in England (n = 188,878). Participants who reported former or current smoking scored approximately 1 point higher, on average, on the AUDIT-C (which measures alcohol consumption) than those who had never regularly smoked (Badj=0.97 [95%CI 0.93-1.00] and 0.92 [0.87-0.96], respectively) and had double the odds of risky drinking (AUDIT-C ≥ 5: ORadj=2.04 [1.98-2.10] and 2.03 [1.97-2.10], respectively), while differences for those who did versus did not use non-combustible nicotine use were less pronounced (AUDIT-C: Badj=0.14 [0.08-0.21]; AUDIT-C ≥ 5: ORadj=1.09 [1.04-1.13]). Among participants who engaged in risky drinking, those who smoked (vs. not) were more likely to report receiving alcohol brief interventions, and those attempting to quit smoking (vs. not) were more likely to report alcohol reduction attempts. Overall, combustible and - less so - non-combustible nicotine use is associated with higher levels of alcohol consumption and risky drinking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Systematic investigations were conducted on its physiological and biochemical characteristics, environmental adaptability, and degradation mechanisms. The strain is a Gram-negative, non-motile aerobic bacterium capable of tolerating extreme conditions, including a pH range of 6-11, salinity up to 10%, and temperatures between 15 °C and 44 °C, while exhibiting notable nicotine tolerance. The strain demonstrated robust cellulolytic activity, with a CMCase activity of 65.25 U/mL after 24 h incubation. Inoculation with LXX12 resulted in a 65.7% weight loss of tobacco straw after 35 days of treatment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses confirmed its synergistic degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the strain's genome harbors 65 CAZy enzyme genes, including 11 glycoside hydrolases (GH3 and GH5 family endoglucanases and β-glucosidases) for cellulose degradation, 6 auxiliary redox enzymes (AA3, AA4, and AA6 family vanillyl alcohol oxidases and 1,4-benzoquinone reductases) for lignin modification, as well as CE3 acetylxylan esterases and CBM50 substrate-binding modules. These enzymes collectively form a ""backbone depolymerization-side chain modification-redox-driven"" multi-enzyme synergistic network. KEGG pathway analysis further elucidated its capability to convert lignin derivatives into carbon sources via benzoate degradation, glycolysis, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Based on 16 S rDNA sequence alignment, the strain showed 99.78% similarity to Acinetobacter indicus CIP 110,367 strain A648, and was designated Acinetobacter indicus LXX12 despite notable phenotypic discrepancies. The isolation and functional characterization of this strain provide a novel microbial resource for lignocellulose bioconversion, combining high efficiency with environmental adaptability, and hold significant potential for agricultural waste valorization.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The highest risk from tobacco use arises from combustion in the form of cigarettes. While cigarette consumption remains prevalent in the developing world, in the UK the rates of smoking are falling. In Sweden, modified smokeless tobacco in the form of snus has been available for many years and has contributed to reduced levels of smoking. In high income countries, new forms of tobacco consumption and nicotine delivery products have been developed over the last few years. These include heat-not-burn cigarettes and electronic cigarettes, and these products are now being actively marketed by many companies, including the tobacco industry.

The sensing principle of the disposable sensor is based on the size exclusion effect and charge selectivity, which obviously prolong the sensor service time. We find that the sensor exhibits good specificity to nicotine, and most of the complex matrices are unlikely to impact the detection. The performance of the disposable sensor in cigarettes, e-cigarettes, nicotine gums, and lozenges is fully validated, showing satisfactory linearity, sensitivity (a limit of detection of 27.82 nM), and accuracy (a recovery between 96.00% and 106.51%).

This is probably due to some components of tobacco smoke. When smokers quit, MAOB activity returns to normal. Reduced MAO activity may increase nicotine's addictive potential. AIMS: To assess whether lazabemide, a reversible selective MAOB inhibitor, promotes smoking cessation. STUDY DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase II study. Placebo, lazabemide 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day were administered for 8 weeks. This was a dose finding, proof-of-concept, exploratory study. SETTING: General practices and anti-smoking clinics in France and Belgium. PARTICIPANTS: Smokers smoking > or=15 cigarettes per day and motivated to quit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Sustained abstinence during the last 4 weeks of the study. FINDINGS: The study was discontinued prematurely by the sponsor before randomization of the planned 420 smokers because of liver toxicity observed in other indications. Data of 330 randomized subjects could be analysed. Sustained abstinence during the last 4 weeks of treatment was 9%, 11% and 17% in the intent-to-treat population [P for trend: 0.036 (one-sided)]; 11%, 14% and 21% in the intent-to-treat population of smokers without those excluded because of discontinuation of the study [n = 262, P for trend: 0.02 (one-sided)], and 19%, 27% and 35% in completers [P for trend: 0.03 (one-sided)], in the placebo, lazabemide 100 mg/day and lazabemide 200 mg/day groups, respectively. Point prevalence abstinence (intent-to-treat population) at the end of treatment (week 8) was 17%, 19% and 30% in the placebo, lazabemide 100 mg/day and lazabemide 200 mg/day groups, respectively (placebo vs. lazabemide 200 mg/day: P = 0.01, one-sided). No treatment emergent major adverse event occurred. More nausea and insomnia were reported with lazabemide than with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: MAOB inhibitors are promising treatments as an aid in smoking cessation. There may be an interest to develop MAOB inhibitors with an acceptable toxicity profile. Further studies may associate MAOB inhibitors with nicotine replacement therapies to increase therapeutic efficacy.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Because of restrictive measures and widespread control policies, tobacco companies are now using aggressive marketing strategies in favor of smokeless tobacco, including electronic nicotine delivery systems, which are also known as electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Although the regular use of these devices appears less hazardous than traditional cigarettes or other forms of smokeless tobacco, recent studies have shown that various potentially harmful substances, especially nicotine, ultraparticles, and volatile organic compounds, may be effectively inhaled or liberated in exhaled air during repeated e-cigarette puffing. This would enhance the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, which may predispose some users to increased risk of cardiovascular events, which may be further magnified by other potential adverse effects such as arrhythmias, increased respiratory, and flow respiratory resistance. Some cases of intoxication have also been described, wherein large amounts of nicotine and other harmful compounds may be effectively absorbed. As the use of e-cigarettes is continuously rising, and it is also considered a potentially effective method for smoking cessation, more focused research is urgently needed to definitely establish the cardiovascular safeness of these devices.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

We review the existing evidence on the safety and efficacy of electronic cigarettes. We then revisit the tobacco harm reduction debate, with a focus on these novel products.

We transcribed each 2-hour focus group verbatim and analyzed it using domain analysis. The discussions revealed several reasons why smokers are not receptive to SLT. First, smokers associated new spit-less SLT (that is, Snus) with historic images of chewing tobacco. Second, smokers viewed smoking as an incentive to take a break from their daily routine. Third, smokers expressed lack of control over nicotine delivery when using SLT, relative to cigarettes.

To explore the reasons for CAG abandonment, we searched the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents database for key terms including 'Capillary Aerosol,' 'Project LEAP' (the project under which the CAG was housed), and 'Tony Howell' (CAG inventor). The results show that regulatory, legal, and political concerns deterred CAG development. A lack of progress even after these concerns had abated seems to reveal a larger reluctance to innovate non-tobacco products-perhaps due to concerns about competing against tobacco cigarettes. We also explored additional explanations such as technological barriers and lack of consumer interest.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Pyrazines are an important class of these additives, and their presence in tobacco cigarettes has been correlated with increased acceptability of smoking among smokers and bystanders. Pyrazine use by the tobacco industry is therefore thought to encourage smoking. However, the extent of transfer of pyrazines present in the liquid to aerosols upon vaping remains unclear. We present a simple analytical method to quantify six pyrazine derivatives in liquids and aerosols of ECIGs that allows the isolation of pyrazines from interfering compounds, like nicotine. Standard pyrazine solutions and commercial ECIG samples of different brands and flavors were tested for their pyrazine content in the liquids and in the generated aerosols from these solutions. Testing on ECIG commercial liquids revealed a heterogeneous distribution in the levels and types of pyrazines, with acetyl and alkyl pyrazines present in more than 70% of the samples. This method confirmed that pyrazine additives are common in ECIG and that labels do not usually reflect the type and quantity of pyrazines in the liquid. Pyrazines were not correlated with the nicotine content or the brand of the liquid. The aerosols showed similar pyrazine profiles to their corresponding liquids. The efficiency of transfer of pyrazines into the particle phase was approximately 46%. Therefore, addition of pyrazines to ECIGs should be regulated, because they act synergistically with nicotine to increase product appeal, ease smoking initiation, and discourage cessation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Concerns have been raised that some ECIG liquid flavors, especially those that are sweet, are attracting otherwise nicotine-naïve youth to ECIGs. Sucralose is an artificial, non-caloric sweetener that is added to some ECIG liquids. In this study, we evaluated the toxicants, namely isomers of chloropropanols that can be produced when sucralose-containing ECIG liquid is aerosolized. An analytical separation method relying on solid-phase extraction (SPE) to isolate chloropropanols from the propylene glycol/glycerol matrix was developed. Chloropropanols were then derivatized by silylation before they were analyzed on GC-MS. The influence of different ECIG operating conditions on the generation of chloropropanols was studied by varying ECIG device design and power output and also the sucralose concentration of the liquid. Heated sucralose-containing ECIG liquids produce two toxic compounds that can be found in the resulting aerosols. The two chloropropanols, 3-monochloro-1,2-propanediol (3-MCPD) and 1,3-dichloropropanol (1,3-DCP) that were detected under all conditions were found to be correlated significantly with liquid sucralose content. Effective regulation of ECIGs will minimize user and bystander exposure to these and other ECIG toxicants.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

The current study examined whether positive results would be replicated in 11 programs participating subsequently. Program directors (N = 11) completed surveys of tobacco-related policies pre- and post-intervention. Pre- (n = 163) and post-intervention (n = 128) cross-sectional staff surveys examined tobacco-related training, beliefs, practices, smoking policy, and smoking status. Directors reported increases in tobacco-free grounds (from 3 to 8 programs), tobacco-related staff training (1 to 10 programs), tobacco cessation staff services (1 to 9 programs) and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) provision (6 to 10 programs). At post-intervention, staff were more likely to report smoke-free workplaces (p = 0.008), positive beliefs about treating tobacco use (p = 0.017) and less likely to report current smoking (p = 0.003). Clinical staff were more likely to report tobacco-related training receipt (p = 0.001), program-level NRT provision (p = 0.009) and conducting tobacco-related client services (p < 0.0001) post-intervention. Findings of increases in tobacco-free grounds and tobacco cessation client services corroborated prior results. These and the additional finding of decreases in staff smoking strengthen evidence that initiatives supporting tobacco-free policies can be successfully implemented in SUD treatment.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Participants: Random sample of 614 California vape shops, stratified by distance to community colleges or 4-year universities/colleges; visited June-August, 2019. Methods: Logistic regressions examined whether signage varied by distance to colleges and whether stores sold other tobacco products (OTP). Results: Compliance with the state-mandated age-of-sale sign was 69.4%; vape-only stores were less compliant than vape + OTP (AOR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.22,0.70). Age-of-entry signs were more common in vape-only (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.07,3.28) than vape + OTP stores. However, this difference was greater for vape-only stores near community colleges and attenuated for vape-only stores near 4-year universities/colleges.

For this purpose, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and antioxidant potential (AOP) values were measured in the plasma samples before and after cigarette smoking at fasting. After the first blood sample was obtained, second and third samples were withdrawn at 1.5 h and 3 h. In the first group, subjects smoked five cigarettes with full flavor (FF), and in the second group, five cigarettes with full-flavor low tar (FFLT). Quality classification is made mainly on the basis of tar content of the products. The cigarette with 23 mg tar is defined as FF and that with 12 mg tar as FFLT. MDA level was found to be significantly increased in the 1.5-h plasma samples of both groups, but the increase was greater in the FF group. AOP values, however, were found to be lower in the 3-h plasma samples of both groups, but the decrease was greater in the FF group compared with the FFLT group. It appears that acute smoking causes oxidant stress in blood plasma once exposed to smoke, and then this effect (MDA) begins to decrease. On the other hand, AOP is lowered due to oxidant stress created by smoke. With regard to the types of cigarettes, the FF product seems to be more oxidant than the FFLT product. Our results suggest that antioxidant supplementation might be beneficial for the smokers to cope with the oxidant load derived from cigarette smoke. It is also clearly seen from these results that cigarette manufacturers should reduce tar/nicotine ratio in their products in order to lessen the toxic effects of smoking without causing increased need to smoke.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The correlations found between MS smoke acetaldehyde yield and ""tar"" and MS smoke carbon monoxide, and the percentage of the variance in AA yield explained by ""tar"" and MS smoke CO, coupled with the lack of correlation between ""tar"" normalized MS smoke AA and RS, plus related pyrolysis studies, support the hypothesis that MS smoke acetaldehyde yields are affected more by cigarette design characteristics influencing total smoke production than by tobacco reducing sugars.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

A recent National Cancer Institute monograph claimed these apparent benefits of lower delivery products may be illusory if relative risks are adjusted for daily consumption, and switching leads to ""compensation"" for reduced nicotine intake by increasing numbers of cigarettes smoked. To investigate this, we compared relative risks unadjusted and adjusted for daily cigarette consumption. Overall estimates of the filter/plain relative risk, using random-effects meta-analysis, were 0.61 (95%confidence interval 0.54 to 0.70) for unadjusted data and 0.66 (0.58 to 0.76) for adjusted data. The lower tar/higher tar relative risk was estimated as 0.60 (0.45 to 0.81) for unadjusted data and 0.73 (0.64 to 0.83) for adjusted data. The risk reductions were clearly seen regardless of gender, study location, period, or design, and when only studies providing both unadjusted and adjusted estimates were considered. Whether or not relative risk estimates are adjusted for cigarette consumption is not crucial to the conclusion of a clear advantage to filter cigarettes and tar reduction. Data on ""compensation"" for amount smoked were reviewed and any increase following switching to reduced-tar-yield cigarettes was shown to be quite small. Other biases in the epidemiology are also discussed, and we conclude that the apparent advantage to reduced-tar-delivery products is real and likely to be a marked underestimate of the reduction in lung cancer risk from lifetime smoking of low-tar cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The study utilized a cross-over design where participants used two ENDS in a random order as smoking substitutes during two use periods separated by 7 days.

Participants smoked a mean of 16.9 (SD = 7.9) CPD at baseline. Overall, CPD significantly decreased during both ENDS use periods (p < .01) but there were no differences in reduction between the different devices. CO decreased from baseline to follow-up only during the button-activated ENDS use period (p = .03), but there were no differences between ENDS devices. There were no significant differences in ratings of acceptability between ENDS devices.

Public health has struggled to cope with these changes and clear divisions are apparent, but less is known about the tobacco industry (TI) response. This first empirical study to examine TI and independent ANDS companies' business strategies fills this gap. Primary data were collected through 28 elite interviews with senior/influential TI and independent stakeholders, triangulated with a documentary analysis of company reports, investor analyses, market research, and consultation responses (1022 documents). A deliberately emic analysis shows that tobacco multinationals were initially disconcerted by ANDS, but logic provided by the fiduciary imperative is enabling them to turn a potential threat into profitable opportunities. Interviewees argue market changes played to their strengths: customer links, expertise in nicotine, and enormous financial resources. This enabled portfolio diversification in which combustible and ANDS coexist; providing potential to develop robust scientific and regulatory positions and hope of retrieving corporate reputations. The principal threat for major tobacco players comes from the independent sector, which is prepared and able to satisfy bespoke consumer needs. Multinationals by contrast need to turn ANDS into a genuinely mass-market product appealing to its global customers. They are making progress. Given the continued buoyancy of the combustibles market, they have extensive resources to continue their efforts. Disruptive innovations are not unique to tobacco control. Equivalent technological solutions - with concomitant business opportunities - are emerging in obesity and alcohol fields with implications for public health.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Although nicotine creates dependency, it is the contaminated delivery system that causes tobacco-related harm. With an annual global tobacco market > USD$300 billion, and a large proportion of the > 1 billion tobacco users seeking to avoid the 50% risk of death, there should be a huge market for alternative nicotine delivery systems. A move towards risk reduction could significantly benefit public health, provide consumer choice and allow free market forces to combat the leading cause of preventable death. However, market forces are currently prevented from providing consumers with the risk-reducing products they want because of existing regulatory systems. Tobacco products have been exempted from consumer protection laws, but there are no such exemptions for other nicotine delivery products, e.g. NRT. This has resulted in an exceedingly uneven playing field for nicotine products, with the most harmful products subject to little regulation while the least hazardous products are stringently regulated. In effect the world is upside-down, and nicotine regulatory systems should be reformed in order to maximize the reduction in risk. In addition, regulatory bodies need to: develop nicotine- and tobacco-specific expertise, rapidly evaluate which products should be permitted and decide how these products should be marketed. Appropriate regulatory structures could harness the power of free enterprise in global efforts to control the tobacco epidemic. This can be done through the development of regulatory processes designed to ensure that all nicotine delivery products are considered in relative terms (regardless of source), and ensuring that all regulatory action strives for the greatest practical reductions in risk.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

On average, smokers perceived health threat of snus as somewhat serious, but believed they can effectively avert this threat.

No support was found for the proposition that when perceived efficacy is low, greater threat is associated with greater message rejection.

Associations between trust in sources of e-cigarette health effects and attitudes toward e-cigarettes were assessed using weighted logistic regression. Overall, e-cigarette ever users reported significantly lower trust in governmental agencies as compared to never users. Trust in e-cigarette companies was negatively associated with perceived addictiveness of e-cigarettes (AOR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.58, 1.00), while trust in doctors/pharmacists/healthcare providers was negatively associated with harm perceptions of e-cigarettes relative to conventional cigarettes (AOR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.55, 0.95).

Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the interrelationship of internalizing problems, tobacco advertising receptivity, and tobacco use among young adults using data from Wave 1 of the Population Assessment for Tobacco and Health Study. Methods: The sample included 9,110 young adults (ages 18-24). Multivariable logistic regression models examined the association between internalizing problems and advertising receptivity and tobacco use. Separate models were run for cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and any tobacco use. An interaction term (receptivity × internalizing problems) was added to each model. Results: Except for smokeless tobacco, individuals with high internalizing problems reported greater odds of product use compared to those with low internalizing problems. There was no association between internalizing problems and use of smokeless tobacco. For all products, receptivity was positively associated with tobacco use. A borderline significant interaction was detected between cigarette advertising receptivity and internalizing problems, such that the magnitude of the relationship between receptivity to cigarette advertising and cigarette use was stronger for those with high internalizing problems compared those with low internalizing problems. Conclusions/Importance: The relationship between cigarette advertising receptivity and cigarette use may differ for those with and without internalizing problems. Disproportionate receptivity to risk-promoting messages among young adults with internalizing problems could exacerbate disparities in cigarette use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We aimed to identify e-cigarette marketing strategies used and products marketed on brand-sponsored Facebook profiles and assess whether these strategies and featured products differ by user engagement. METHODS: We examined up to 10 recent Facebook posts on 26 e-cigarette brand-sponsored profile pages uploaded between August 1 and November 31, 2016. We identified positive engagement (i.e. ""like,"" ""love""), negative engagement (i.e. ""sad,"" ""angry""), post type (e.g. link, photo), type of sales promotion (e.g. giveaways, discounts), non-sales promotion (e.g. event promotion without product marketing), and marketed products (e.g. e-cigarettes, e-liquids). RESULTS: We examined 225 Facebook posts. Engagement was modest (e.g. Median ""likes"" = 8 [Min = 0, Max = 591]). The most common post types were photos (52.6%) and links (35.5%). Of all links, 83.7% were links to online shops. Of all posts, 35.0% had overt sales promotional content, 32.0% featured non-sales promotional content, and 68.0% featured an e-cigarette product. The most commonly featured product was an e-cigarette device (50.6%). Posts with more positive engagement included giveaways (versus sales [p = 0.009]) and posts marketing vaping devices (versus e-liquids [p = 0.004)]). Negative engagement was not associated with marketing strategies or products. Of the brand-sponsored profile pages, 42.3% could be accessed by underage users. DISCUSSION: E-cigarettes are marketed on Facebook using a variety of promotional strategies. Importantly, underage youth often can access this marketing content. Comprehensive tobacco control policies that restrict e-cigarette marketing on social media are needed urgently.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Little is known about exposure to tobacco-related messages among military personnel from disadvantaged backgrounds. Objectives: The current study aimed to examine exposure to tobacco-related messaging across many nicotine products and through a variety of mediums (i.e., family, friends, advertisements, event promotions, social media) among diverse military populations and use one year later in a sample of young adults who recently enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. Methods: In this study, 8,901 U.S. Air Force trainees reported on demographics, tobacco use, and exposure to positive tobacco messages from social sources (i.e., friends, family, social media) and environmental sources (i.e., advertisements and promotions). Tobacco use was reported one-year later. Results: Compared to others of the same reported racial/ethnic background, Latino/a/x (Relative Risk Ratio [RRR] = 1.354, 95% CI: [1.145, 1.563]) and multiracial (RRR = 1.594, 95% CI: [1.173, 2.016]) participants who were exposed to positive tobacco messages from social sources were significantly more likely to report tobacco product use at one-year follow-up than those who were not exposed to social messages. Exposure to positive tobacco messages from environmental sources were not significantly associated with tobacco use one year later. Conclusions: Social messages may play an important role in increasing risk of tobacco use among some minoritized populations. Cultural as well as systemic factors could be addressed in future tobacco prevention programs to decrease the potency of positive tobacco-related social messages among Latino/a/x and multiracial communities.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In response to the harmful effects of conventional tobacco products the tobacco industry has launched a new type of products called Heated tobacco products (HTP) and e-cigarettes, which are considered safer for human health than conventional cigarettes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research was conducted by searching the scientific literature using platforms ""Google scholar,"" ""PubMed"" and ""Science Direct."" To compare the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk of HTP products and conventional cigarettes, margin of exposure and lifetime excess cancer risk were calculated using data obtained from a scientific literature search. UNLABELLED: HTP products have shown a reduced risk to human health compared to the conventional cigarettes, although they still contain compounds that can be dangerous to human health. There is not enough data obtained from independent studies that could safely indicate that these reduced amounts of toxic chemical entities in the composition of HTP do not induce any harmful effect. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to determine the harmful effects of HTP aerosol, as well as to tighten the legislation that would limit the production, import and distribution of these products worldwide until their safety for human health is confirmed with a sufficient number of transparent and representative results obtained in independent scientific studies.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

However, it is unclear whether co-use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and/or cannabis is associated with higher levels of nicotine dependence than cigarette-only use. We investigated the relationship between cigarette/nicotine dependence and co-use of tobacco and cannabis among 4 groups of cigarette smokers aged 18-35: cigarette-only smokers, cigarette-e-cigarette (CIG-ECIG) co-users, cigarette-cannabis (CIG-CAN) co-users, and cigarette-e-cigarette-cannabis (CIG-ECIG-CAN) co-users. METHODS: Data were from a 2018 cross-sectional survey based on a national convenience sample of smokers aged 18-35 (n = 315). Cigarette/nicotine dependence was measured by the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and e-cigarette dependence was measured by the Penn State E-cigarette Dependence Index. Bivariate analyses examined sociodemographic and tobacco/other substance use characteristics by co-use status and multivariable linear regression assessed the relationship between co-use and nicotine dependence. RESULTS: In the sample, 27.6% were cigarette-only smokers, 24.8% were CIG-ECIG, 27.6% were CIG-CAN, and 20.0% were CIG-ECIG-CAN co-users. Significant differences were observed in sociodemographic and tobacco/other substance use characteristics by co-use status. E-cigarette co-users had low e-cigarette dependence, but moderate FTND scores. In adjusted analyses, only CIG-ECIG co-use was associated with higher FTND scores compared to cigarette-only smoking. However, CIG-ECIG and CIG-ECIG-CAN co-use were associated with higher FTND scores compared to CIG-CAN co-use. CONCLUSIONS: Co-use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes was associated with greater nicotine dependence among smokers aged 18-35. Additional research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of these relationships and inform prevention efforts.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

However, little is known about how vaping identity (i.e., internalizing vaping as an important part of oneself) can influence young adults' e-cigarette perceptions. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between vaping identity and e-cigarette perceptions among young adults. Methods: Young adults who vape (N = 252, Mage = 24.7) were recruited to participate in an online survey assessing a trusted source of health information, e-cigarette harm perceptions, and intentions to abstain from vaping. We estimated associations between vaping identity on outcomes and the interaction of vaping identity and combustible cigarette use on outcomes. Results: Participants with higher vaping identity reported lower trust in government health agencies and a doctor, and higher trust in the tobacco industry and e-cigarette industry (ps < 0.05). Those with higher vaping identity also reported lower e-cigarette harm perceptions and intentions to abstain from vaping (ps < 0.05). Conclusions: Findings show that higher vaping identity is associated with greater trust in the tobacco industry, lower trust in health experts, lower e-cigarette harm perceptions, and lower intentions to abstain from using e-cigarettes. This suggests that efforts to reduce vaping among young adults may need to leverage messages that reduce the credibility of the tobacco industry and prevent nonsmoking young adults from developing a vaping identity.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Commentary.,"Background: Tobacco-related promotional content on social media often features young-looking influencers, models, or brand ambassadors who are appealing to youth; their posts often have inconsistent disclosures of partnerships with tobacco brands and lack age-restrictions prohibiting access to users under 18 or 21 years of age. These examples demonstrate violations of the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marketing restrictions. Methods: Marketing granted orders issued by the FDA to RJ Reynolds, Logic Technology, NJOY and Phillip Morris as part of the Premarket Tobacco Product Applications (PMTA) review process were qualitatively analyzed. Marketing practices that the tobacco companies intended to adhere to (e.g., refrain from using young-looking influencers in marketing materials) were documented. Perceived age of 55 micro-influencers who promote e-cigarette products on Instagram were assessed by 15 undergraduate student raters. Results: Despite the existing regulations of tobacco-related online marketing, the use of models or influencers and overall social media marketing is not prohibited, which leaves room for potential use of loopholes. The tobacco companies that were issued marketing granted orders set different age limits for the models to be considered young-looking and not to be used in marketing materials. The perceived age of the 55 influencers assessed by the raters was between 21-30, which is below the age limit proposed in several PMTA applications. Conclusion: Tobacco product online marketing, especially on social media, is underregulated. Strengthening tobacco marketing regulations, along with partnering of policymakers with social media platforms on establishing and maintaining effective tobacco-restriction policies, could help reduce proliferation of youth-appealing marketing of tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Limited information is available to assess the brand engagement tactics used to promote the two most popular tobacco products in the US - cigarettes and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) - across different advertising platforms (e.g., direct-to-consumer (DTC), social media). Material and methods: We acquired 520 cigarette and 5,502 e-cigarette ads that ran in the US January 2019 to December 2020 from market research firms (Kantar, Numerator), Rutger's University ad surveillance website (trinketsandtrash.org), and branded social media accounts. Ads were double-coded for eight types of brand engagement tactics: Price Promotion, Sweepstakes, Mobile App, Email/Mail List, Free Gift, Social Media engagement request, Sponsored Events, and Auto-Ship subscription program. We report presence of brand engagement tactics by product type and advertising platform. Results: Overall, 62.9% of cigarette ads and 49.9% of e-cigarette ads contained at least one brand engagement tactic. For cigarette ads, the most common tactics were Sweepstakes and Mobile App requests, which were most commonly featured in DTC ads. For e-cigarettes, the most common tactic was Price Promotion which was featured in most DTC and online e-cigarette ads. Conclusions: Brand engagement was common in this sample of cigarette and e-cigarette ads. Our findings highlight key differences in the type of brand engagement tactic used to promote each product on different advertising platforms. Results can inform continued advertising surveillance studies and regulatory efforts.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

A CAT for substance use disorders (CAT-SUD-E) has been validated in adult populations but has yet to be tested in adolescents. The purpose of this study was to perform initial evaluation of the K-CAT-SUD-E (i.e., Kiddy-CAT-SUD-E) in an adolescent sample compared to a gold-standard diagnostic interview. METHODS: Adolescents (N = 156; aged 11-17) with diverse substance use histories completed the K-CAT-SUD-E electronically and the substance related disorders portion of a clinician-conducted diagnostic interview (K-SADS) via tele-videoconferencing platform. The K-CAT-SUD-E assessed both current and lifetime overall SUD and substance-specific diagnoses for nine substance classes. RESULTS: Using the K-CAT-SUD-E continuous severity score and diagnoses to predict the presence of any K-SADS SUD diagnosis, the classification accuracy ranged from excellent for current SUD (AUC = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.81, 0.95) to outstanding (AUC = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.82, 0.97) for lifetime SUD. Regarding current substance-specific diagnoses, the classification accuracy was excellent for alcohol (AUC = 0.82), cannabis (AUC = 0.83) and nicotine/tobacco (AUC = 0.90). For lifetime substance-specific diagnoses, the classification accuracy ranged from excellent (e.g., opioids, AUC = 0.84) to outstanding (e.g., stimulants, AUC = 0.96). K-CAT-SUD-E median completion time was 4 min 22 s compared to 45 min for the K-SADS. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial support for the K-CAT-SUD-E as a feasible accurate diagnostic tool for assessing SUDs in adolescents. Future studies should further validate the K-CAT-SUD-E in a larger sample of adolescents and examine its acceptability, feasibility, and scalability in youth-serving settings.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Most people who use e-cigarettes have interest in quitting, yet there is currently a lack of evidence to inform interventions for e-cigarette cessation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with successful e-cigarette quit attempts among a large sample of people who use e-cigarettes. Methods: Participants (n=586) were people who use e-cigarettes who reported at least one lifetime attempt to quit their e-cigarette use. Adjusted logistic regression models were performed to examine differences in e-cigarette use characteristics and quit methods between people who currently use e-cigarettes and who quit e-cigarettes. Results: Most participants were people who currently use e-cigarettes and only 27.5% reported successfully quitting. Most participants (90.6%) used e-cigarettes that contained nicotine, and over half (54.0%) used closed-system e-cigarette devices with replaceable pre-filled pods or cartridges. The quit method most commonly used overall (63.1%) and for people who quit e-cigarettes (70.8%) was cold turkey. Past 30-day cigarette use and past 30-day other tobacco use was significantly associated with reduced odds of quitting, and there were no e-cigarette characteristics significantly associated with successful cessation. Nicotine replacement therapy was the only e-cigarette cessation method that was significantly associated with increased odds of quitting after adjusting for past 30-day cigarette and other tobacco use. Conclusions: These results suggests that cigarette use, other tobacco use, and quit method used may significantly influence the likelihood of e-cigarette cessation. Future research is needed to determine the effectiveness of interventions for e-cigarette cessation using nicotine replacement therapy.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

This study examines the association of exposure to industry-sponsored corrective statements on perceptions of the addictiveness of low-nicotine cigarettes relative to typical cigarettes within the general US population. METHODS: The study comprised 4975 US adult respondents of the 2019 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5, Cycle 3). Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine associations between exposure to tobacco industry corrective messages and perceptions of the addictiveness of low-nicotine cigarettes relative to typical cigarettes. RESULTS: In the overall population, 4.1% reported that low-nicotine cigarettes were much more addictive than typical cigarettes, 67.5% said they were equally addictive, while 28.4% reported they were slightly/much less addictive. Adults exposed to industry-sponsored corrective messages had higher odds of perceiving low-nicotine cigarettes as equally addictive as typical cigarettes (aOR 1.57; 95% CI, 1.13-2.19) than those who saw no corrective messages. Those exposed to the corrective messages specifically about the addictiveness of smoking and nicotine had higher odds of perceiving low-nicotine cigarettes as equally addictive as typical cigarettes (aOR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.07-2.81) compared to those who saw no corrective message. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that exposure to court-ordered tobacco industry corrective statements may have reinforced perceptions on the addictive potential of nicotine. However, study findings indicate a need for campaigns specifically tailored to address misperceptions observed in this study.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Participants were Hip Hop-identifying youth living in evaluation markets who had not initiated cigar product use at their first survey. OBJECTIVES: We modeled cigar product initiation odds using discrete time survival analysis logistic regression models as a function of factors related to one's large social, physical, social/normative, and intrapersonal environment, and other tobacco use. RESULTS: In the unique sample, 26.2% initiated cigar product use. Factors associated with higher cigar product initiation odds included: current/former (vs. non-susceptible never) cigarette smoking (odds ratio [OR]=5.35; p=.008); cigarette experimentation (vs. non-susceptible never smoking) (OR=3.26; p<.001); current (vs. never) e-cigarette use (OR=2.06; p<.001) and hookah use (OR=1.83; p=.011); having at least one friend who uses marijuana (OR=1.43; p=.008); high music use (OR=1.32; p=.035); household tobacco use (OR=1.26; p =.042); increased age (OR=1.18; p< .001); and higher sensation seeking (OR=1.16; p=.018).

The Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) imposed major restrictions on tobacco company marketing practices in 1999, including banning the sale and distribution of merchandize with combustible cigarette or smokeless tobacco brand names or logos. However, the MSA does not include restrictions on e-cigarette marketing, as these products were not yet on the market at the time of the settlement. Exposure to or use of e-cigarette branded merchandize advertised on social media could contribute to normalization of e-cigarette use by youth. METHODS: We estimated the prevalence of merchandize (e.g., t-shirts, caps, and key chains) with e-cigarette brand names or logos in 2000 TikTok videos (2021-2022) that featured U.S. and international micro-influencers (content creators with about 10,000-100,000 followers) who promoted e-cigarettes on behalf of e-cigarette brands. RESULTS: Of 2,000 videos, 152 (8%) had merchandise merchandise with e-cigarette brand names or logos; 125 (6%) featured micro-influencers wearing branded clothing items, i.e., t-shirts, caps, beanies, hoodies, and sweatshirts; and 27 (2%) featured influencers wearing or showing branded accessories, i.e., face masks, stickers, pins, mugs, car air fresheners, lanyards, and key chains.

Despite policies restricting tobacco marketing to youth under age 21, many adolescents and young adults nonetheless report finding tobacco marketing appealing. This analysis aimed to identify which advertising strategies most appeal to young adults ages 18-20. METHODS: In 2021, 740 U.S. participants aged 18-20 completed an online survey evaluating 78 cigarette and 84 e-cigarette ads. Participants viewed and reported their level of receptivity (liking, curiosity, and interest in the product). Content analysis was used to identify potentially youth-appealing features in the ads. Content coding data and participant ratings were then merged, and mixed effects logistic regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between ad features and participant receptivity. RESULTS: Among e-cigarette ads, presence of social media engagement requests was associated with increased liking and curiosity. Presence of flavors and claims that the product was easy to use were associated with increased curiosity. Among cigarette ads, socialization themes were associated with increased liking and curiosity, while the presence of sweepstakes was associated with increased curiosity and use interest. CONCLUSION: This study identified several features of cigarette and e-cigarette ads, respectively associated with increased receptivity among young adults ages 18-20. These findings suggest the need for broader regulations on tobacco advertising beyond traditional youth appeal markers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Though existing medications for OUD (MOUD) are effective, barriers to initiation and retention in treatment persist. Therefore, development of novel treatments, especially those may complement existing treatments, is needed. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of vaccines for substance use disorders (SUD) and mechanisms underlying their function and efficacy. Next, we focus on existing preclinical and clinical trials of SUD vaccines. We focus briefly on related strategies before providing an expert opinion on prior, current, and future work on vaccines for OUD. We included published findings from preclinical and clinical trials found on PubMed and ScienceDirect as well as ongoing or initiated trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov. EXPERT OPINION: The present opioid overdose and OUD crises necessitate urgent development and implementation of effective treatments, especially those that offer protection from overdose and can serve as adjuvants to existing medications.

These products have lower concentrations of tobacco-specific nitrosamines and of other harmful chemicals than other tobacco products, but can deliver relatively high doses of nicotine. They are packaged in small sachets, similar to tea bags that are placed between cheek and gum. Global promotion of smokeless tobacco products is hotly debated among tobacco control and public health experts. Proponents point to the Swedish experience where snus (Swedish moist snuff) is widely used as an alternative to cigarette smoking among men. Meanwhile, Sweden has low rates of smoking and a lower rate of respiratory diseases and lung cancers by comparison to other developed countries. The opponents argue that snus has its own risks, that no form of tobacco should ever be promoted; and that 'snus is culture-bound and not transferable to other settings'. Critics also suspect that the tobacco industry will use snus marketing as a 'gateway' to promote cigarettes among young people. Research on the effects of marketing snus to smokers is too limited to support using snus as a harm-reduction tool, and the epidemiological data are not conclusive.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The short- and long-term effects of these systems must be evaluated to determine the risks inherent in their use. One such system, the Accord, uses a hand-held device to heat tobacco electronically and is marketed as a means to reduce second-hand smoke. In this study 10 cigarette smokers (> or = 10 cigarettes per day) were recruited to evaluate the short-term effects produced when using this system. Subjects abstained from smoking for at least 8 h before participating in two experimental sessions where they smoked either their usual brand or used the Accord at 30-min intervals for 2 hours. Subject-rated measures of tobacco withdrawal and craving, physiological measures, and smoking behavior were assessed within each session. Results show that, when using the Accord, the magnitude of smoking-induced craving reductions and the physiological effects of smoking were less, and puff volume and frequency were greater than when subjects smoked their own brand of cigarettes. The expired air carbon monoxide increases observed after smoking own brand cigarettes did not occur after using the Accord. The novel system does not provide maximal withdrawal suppression and produces little increase in expired air carbon monoxide; physiological data suggest that the novel system may deliver nicotine less efficiently than normally marketed cigarettes. Smokers using the Accord system may smoke more often or more intensely to compensate for decreased withdrawal suppression and/or nicotine delivery.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Tobacco companies are marketing novel products (e.g., Phillip Morris' Accord, R.J. Reynolds' Eclipse) intended to reduce these risks. Evaluation of these products is necessary to determine if they increase, decrease, or fail to change smoking's health risks. This study examines the acute effects of the Accord system on cigarette smokers; the study extends a previous preliminary evaluation by controlling for the system's eight-puff/cigarette limit, smokers' brand preference, and the act of smoking. Smokers of light or ultra-light cigarette brands (> or = 10 cigarettes/day, 16 men and 16 women) participated in this within-subjects protocol. Prior to each of the four, Latin-square ordered, approximately 2.5-h sessions, subjects abstained from smoking for at least 8 h. In each session, subjects smoked eight puffs, at 30-min intervals, from either their own brand of cigarettes, a marketed brand that was not their own, de-nicotinized tobacco cigarettes, or the novel smoking system. Subjective and physiological effects were assessed regularly. Results confirmed previous observations that the withdrawal suppression, CO intake, and tachycardia produced by the novel system are all less than that produced by normally marketed cigarette brands, even controlling for the system's eight-puff limitation and for brand preference. Incomplete withdrawal suppression may increase smoking frequency, thus potentially offsetting any decreased risks associated with Accord use. Laboratory studies of the acute effects of novel smoking systems are an important part of a comprehensive evaluation program.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Like today's new technologies, two previous generations of cigarette innovation-filtered cigarettes in the 1950s and low tar and nicotine cigarettes in the late 1960s and early 1970s were introduced to offer smokers an ostensibly less hazardous means of smoking, and therefore an alternative to quitting. Both innovations maintained cigarette sales and consequently may well have increased the morbidity and mortality toll of smoking. Will a new generation of harm reduction products improve the public's health, or will the experience of the past half-century be repeated? This paper examines the concept of tobacco harm reduction and describes the variety of methods employed in pursuit of it. Through an examination of the experience with filters and low tar and nicotine cigarettes, and an explicit consideration of today's issues and challenges, the paper focuses attention on the essential dimensions of the contemporary harm reduction debate: how science can establish whether novel products or methods will reduce risks to health for individual smokers, or at least exposures likely to influence risks; how a determination can be made as to the likely population impacts of the introduction and marketing of novel products; how health professionals and consumers can learn the potential and limits of harm reduction; and what role for governmental regulation is possible and desirable.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Smokers might view low tar/nicotine brands of cigarettes as a means to reduce the harm to their health from smoking and postpone quitting. Data were from smokers responding to a large, population-based survey of Californians' smoking behavior, conducted in 1996 (8,582 current smokers). Sixty percent of smokers thought the labels light and ultra-light referred to low tar/nicotine cigarettes, or otherwise implied a health claim. This percentage was higher for smokers of low tar/nicotine brands. Among smokers of regular brands, the more highly addicted, those who were trying unsuccessfully to quit, those who had cut consumption or thought about it, and those with health concerns were more likely to have considered switching. While some of these characteristics also were associated with smokers of low tar/nicotine brands, the associations were not as numerous or as strong. We conclude that some smokers appear to view low tar/nicotine brands as one short-term strategy to reduce the harm to their health from smoking without quitting. By implying reduced tar or nicotine exposure, tobacco industry marketing using the labels light and ultra-light is misleading smokers. The use of such labels should be regulated.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

A prospective pilot intervention was used at two community health centers (CHCs) and two community pharmacies. Participants were adult managed-Medicaid or Basic Health Plan enrollees who attended the pilot CHCs and smoked. An innovative insurance benefit that included coverage for NRT and $15 payment to the pharmacist to deliver cessation counseling with each prescription fill. Proportion of eligible patients who used the cessation benefit and patient and pharmacist satisfaction with the intervention. During the 9-month intervention, 32 patients at the pilot clinics were referred for NRT and pharmacist-delivered counseling. This number represented roughly 5% of eligible smokers. Of these, 26 received NRT with concomitant pharmacist-delivered cessation counseling at least once. Recipients reported a high level of satisfaction with this intervention. Pharmacists indicated they would continue providing counseling if reimbursement remained adequate and if counseling lasted no longer than 5-10 min. However, 12 (38%) who were referred were no longer insured by the sponsoring plan by the end of the 9-month pilot period. Pharmacist-delivered cessation counseling may be feasible and merits further study. More importantly, this pilot reveals two key obstacles in our low-income, culturally diverse setting: low participation and rapid turnover of insureds. Future interventions will need to address these barriers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Mechanistically relevant and quantitatively valid biomarkers are essential for assessing the ultimate impact of new products, treatments, preventive measures, and public health policies on tobacco-related disease.

Smokeless tobacco contains the addictive chemical nicotine and more than 20 cancer-causing chemicals, including the potent tobacco-specific nitrosamines. The National Toxicology Program of the National Institutes of Health has concluded that oral use of smokeless tobacco is a human carcinogen. Therefore, smokeless tobacco is not a safe alternative to cigarettes. In fact, smokeless tobacco use begins primarily during early adolescence and can lead to nicotine dependence and increased risk of becoming a cigarette smoker. Under the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 4401 et seq., Pub. L. 99-252), tobacco manufacturers report annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the total nicotine, unprotonated nicotine, pH, and moisture content of their smokeless tobacco products. This information is considered ""trade secret,"" or confidential, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and 18 U.S.C. 1905 and cannot be released to the public. In an effort to provide consumers and researchers with information on the nicotine content of smokeless tobacco, CDC arranged for the analysis of popular brands of smokeless tobacco. The results of this CDC study show that pH is a primary factor in the amount of nicotine that is in the most readily absorbable, unprotonated form. Furthermore, this study found that the brands of moist snuff smokeless tobacco with the largest amount of unprotonated nicotine also are the most frequently sold brands.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Although a considerable body of research has examined the effects of menthol when it is administered alone and unburned, the effects of menthol when burned in cigarette smoke are more complex because it is administered in a matrix of more than 4,000 substances. Therefore, it is difficult to isolate potential pharmacological and toxic effects of menthol when it is administered in a smoke mixture. Menthol properties include cooling and local anesthesia, as well as effects on drug absorption and metabolism, bronchodilation and respiration changes, and electrophysiology. Subjective effects of smoothness and less harshness have been identified as reasons for menthol cigarette smoking, but findings have been inconclusive regarding the effect of menthol on carbon monoxide exposure and smoking topography parameters. Gaps in the research literature and future research areas include the following: (a) What is the role of menthol in tobacco reinforcement and addiction? (b) In the absence of nicotine, is menthol reinforcing? (c) Are the pharmacological and physiological effects of menthol mediated by a menthol-specific receptor or some other central nervous system-mediated action? (d) What are the influences of menthol and menthol metabolism on the metabolic activation and detoxification of carcinogens in tobacco smoke? and (e) Do differences exist in cigarette smoking topography in relation to the interaction of ethnicity, gender, and menthol cigarette preference? Answers to these questions will help to elucidate the function of menthol in cigarettes and its impact on smoking behavior.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Our findings are consistent with a first generation of low-tar cigarettes, which relied primarily on filtration efficiency, being displaced by a second generation, which relied heavily on filter ventilation and were more attractive to consumers. In 1980, both tar and nicotine yields correlated most strongly with filter density (r=-.66, p<.01, and r=-.70, p<.01), whereas in 1994 both tar and nicotine yields correlated most strongly with percentage filter ventilation (r=-.97, p<.01, and r=-.95, p<.01). We also found that median percentage alkaloid content of tobacco rods rose from 2.16% in 1980 to 2.4% in 1994, despite median nicotine yield declining from 1.0 mg to.58 mg.

Data were gathered on demographic characteristics, tobacco use behaviors, awareness and use of nicotine medications, beliefs about the health risks of smoking, content of smoke and design features of cigarettes, and the safety and efficacy of nicotine medications. In addition, respondents were asked about their interest in and perceived ability to stop smoking and about their desire for more information about the health risks of smoking. Smokers were least knowledgeable about low-tar and filter cigarettes (65% of responses were incorrect or ""don't know"") and most knowledgeable about the health risks of smoking (39% of responses were incorrect or ""don't know""). The smokers' characteristics most commonly associated with misinformation when all six indices were combined into a summary index were as follows: those aged 45 years or older, smokers of ultralight cigarettes, smokers who believe they will stop smoking before they experience a serious health problem caused by smoking, smokers who have never used a stop-smoking medication, and smokers with a lower education level. Those who believed they would stop smoking in the next year were more knowledgeable about smoking. Some 77% of respondents reported a desire for additional information from tobacco companies on the health dangers of smoking. The present findings demonstrate that smokers are misinformed about many aspects of the cigarettes they smoke and stop-smoking medications and that they want more information about ways to reduce their health risks.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

A convenience sample of 600 adult smokers reviewed one actual advertisement for each type of product. Smokers ranked the products on health risk, amount of tar, and carcinogenicity, and identified the messages they perceived the advertisements to convey. Smokers perceived PREP products as having lower health risks (mean = 5.4 on a scale of 1-10) and carcinogens (6.6) than light cigarettes (5.8 and 6.9, respectively, p < .001), and lights as having lower health risks and carcinogen levels than regular cigarettes (8.2 and 8.8, respectively, p <.001). The average PREP rating for level of tar (5.3) was not significantly less than the light mean of 5.4, but both were significantly less than the regular mean of 8.4 (p <.001). Although no advertisements explicitly said that the products were healthy or safe, advertisements for PREP products and light cigarettes were interpreted as conveying positive messages about health and safety. Most smokers believed that claims made in cigarette advertisements must be approved by a government agency. The results indicate that advertisements can and do leave consumers with perceptions of the health and safety of tobacco products that are contrary to the scientific evidence. Explicit and implicit advertising messages may be strengthened by the perceived government endorsement. This supports the Institute of Medicine's recommendation to regulate the promotion, advertising, and labeling of PREP tobacco products and light cigarettes. Effective regulation may need to focus on consumer perceptions resulting from advertisements rather than the explicit content of advertising text.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In this study, we catalog the range of efforts undertaken by tobacco manufacturers seeking knowledge of these mechanisms. Some areas of industry research, such as cellular and molecular studies of nicotine and its effects, are widely available in the open literature. Of greater interest are internal research projects that have demonstrated direct influence on product development. These include studies of smoker psychology and behavior, evoked-response studies of tobacco-delivered nicotine, the effects of sensory perception, dose-related effects, and the development of nicotine analogs and synergists. Our findings suggest extensive industry knowledge of mechanisms that determine smoker perception and behavior, and application of this knowledge in product development, including control of sensory response, uptake of nicotine, and product effects. Independent research recently has begun to consider the contributions of tobacco product ingredients and design factors to the determination of risk, severity, and prevalence of addiction. However, the application of these findings to cessation and treatment efforts is still quite limited. We conclude that clinical research would greatly benefit from further examination of the decades of knowledge accumulated by tobacco manufacturers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

We found chemical analyses, sensory evaluations, and discussions of sidestream cigarette smoke (the smoke emitted by the cigarette between puffs, the main component of second-hand smoke), beginning in 1929. American Tobacco Company research in the 1930s indicated that, compared with mainstream smoke, sidestream smoke was produced in larger quantities and contained, per cigarette, 2 times more nicotine and 12 times more ammonia. Research funded by the Tobacco Industry Research Committee in the 1950s revealed that sidestream smoke contained, per unit cigarette, higher concentrations of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, per unit mass, including four times more 3,4 benzopyrene. In 1956 and 1957, respectively, Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds also began to research sidestream smoke. In 1961, Philip Morris began to do sensory evaluation and modification of sidestream odor during product development. This sensory evaluation of sidestream smoke was the first biological testing of sidestream smoke by a tobacco company. Prior to the release of the 1972 U.S. surgeon general's report, the tobacco industry published the majority of its findings in the open scientific literature and does not appear to have perceived second-hand smoke as a threat to human health.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Review of internal tobacco industry documents indicates that levulinic acid was used to increase nicotine yields while enhancing perceptions of smoothness and mildness. Levulinic acid reduces the pH of cigarette smoke and desensitizes the upper respiratory tract, increasing the potential for cigarette smoke to be inhaled deeper into the lungs. Levulinic acid also may enhance the binding of nicotine to neurons that ordinarily would be unresponsive to nicotine. These findings held particular interest in the internal development of ultralight and so-called reduced-exposure cigarette prototypes. Industry studies found significantly increased peak plasma nicotine levels in smokers of ultralight cigarettes following addition of levulinic acid. Further, internal studies observed changes in mainstream and sidestream smoke composition that may present increased health risks. The use of levulinic acid illustrates the need for regulatory authority over tobacco products as well as better understanding of the role of additives in cigarettes and other tobacco products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

At the same time, a range of novel tobacco products is being marketed with claims of reduced exposure or risk. Current scientific efforts to study tobacco products and harm reduction should be informed by past experience. During the 1960s and 1970s, there was substantial support within government and academia, as well as among voluntary health organizations, for efforts to modify tobacco products to reduce harm. This paper analyzes the former National Cancer Institute (NCI) Smoking and Health Program, which, between 1968 and 1980, pursued the development of ""less hazardous"" cigarettes as its primary goal. During this period, the program spent over dollar 50 million on contract research, of which 74% went toward biological and chemical analysis of modified cigarettes, 9.6% to epidemiological studies of risk factors, and only 1.4% to studies evaluating smoking cessation or prevention programs. NCI officials predicted during the mid-1970s that new ""low-tar"" cigarette brands would substantially reduce smoking-related mortality, but by 1978 the research agenda began to change in response to a reorganization of NCI research activities, modification of government antismoking efforts, and an emerging understanding of nicotine addiction that challenged key scientific assumptions. In retrospect, the program suffered from significant weaknesses that severely limited the likelihood that it would generate knowledge beneficial to public health, including a research agenda that failed to include surveillance and behavioral research, tobacco industry influence of the research agenda, and a lack of access to information about the characteristics of products on the market. There exists today a need for a public health-oriented research agenda on tobacco products and harm reduction, but current efforts should include input from a diverse range of disciplines, collect data on users' behavior, and limit the involvement of industry scientists.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Objective evaluation of these products requires, as a first step, data on their potentially toxic constituents. Tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) are an important class of carcinogens in tobacco products, but virtually no data were available on their levels in these products. In the present study, we analyzed several new products-Ariva, Stonewall, Exalt, Revel, Smokey Mountain, and Quest-for TSNAs and compared their TSNA levels with those in nicotine replacement products and conventional smokeless tobacco and cigarette brands. TSNAs were not detected in Smokey Mountain, which is a tobacco-free snuff product. The lowest levels among the new products containing tobacco were in Ariva and Stonewall (0.26-0.28 microg/g wet weight of product). The highest levels in the new products were found in Exalt (3.3 microg/g tobacco), whereas Revel and Quest had intermediate amounts. Only trace amounts were found in nicotine replacement products, and conventional brands had levels consistent with those reported in the literature. These results demonstrate that TSNA levels in new tobacco products range from relatively low to comparable with those found in some conventional brands.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Because nicotine has been shown to accumulate in tissues containing melanin, exploring links between melanin and nicotine may provide additional clues to understanding smoking behavior and disease effects. To examine the scientific literature on the relationship between melanin and nicotine, we conducted a PubMed search. We also searched online archives of internal tobacco industry documents. We retrieved and reviewed 82 published research papers related to melanin and nicotine or melanin and metabolism of other drugs, and 150 relevant internal tobacco industry documents. The published literature suggests that nicotine may accumulate in human tissues containing melanin and this retention may increase melanin synthesis. Existing research on the relationship between melanin and nicotine lacks an adequate consideration of this relationship's potential impact, if any, on nicotine metabolism, level of nicotine dependence, and ability to quit smoking. Differential accumulation of nicotine in melanin-containing tissues could have implications for individuals with high levels of melanin.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, is a potential reduced exposure product (PREP) that heats rather than burns tobacco. We hypothesized that switching to Eclipse would result in relative normalization of pulmonary epithelial permeability, airway inflammation, and blood leukocyte activation in current smokers. We assessed 10 healthy smokers (aged 21-50 years, 19+/-8 pack-years) at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of switching to Eclipse, for symptoms, pulmonary function, airway inflammation, lung clearance of (99m)technicium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and blood leukocyte activation and production of reactive oxygen species. Values were compared before and after Eclipse use and with those of healthy, lifetime nonsmokers (aged 18-53 years). Compared with baseline values before switching to Eclipse, lung permeability half-time increased from 33+/-3 to 43+/-6 min (p = .017) after 2 weeks and to 44+/-7 min (p = .10) after 4 weeks of Eclipse use. Carboxyhemoglobin levels increased from 5%+/-2% to 7%+/-2% (p<.01) at 4 weeks. Compared with smoking the usual brand of cigarettes, after smoking Eclipse the percentage of natural killer cells, the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on monocytes, and the expression of CD45RO on T cells showed significant improvement. However, expression of other surface markers, notably CD23 on monocytes, became more abnormal. Production of reactive oxygen species by smokers' neutrophils and monocytes increased further with Eclipse use. We found no significant effects on pulmonary function, cells in induced sputum, or exhaled nitric oxide. Switching to Eclipse reduces alveolar epithelial injury in some smokers but may increase carboxyhemoglobin levels and oxidative stress.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,No,

The most recent SRNT conference was held for the first time outside of North America and attracted over 900 participants from 50 countries. SRNT also has sponsored workshops, provided member scholarships to researchers from low- and middle-income countries, and partnered with the World Health Organization to host www.treatobacco.net. Although these initiatives are impressive, SRNT can further support global tobacco research by (a) working with other organizations to support global tobacco science and policy (this is especially timely given the recent coming into force of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control), (b) providing more resources including increased funding and access to online journals for those in low- and middle-income countries, (c) increasing the representation of science at world and national tobacco conferences, and (d) expanding the role of the Training Committee to place increased emphasis on mentoring tobacco scientists from low- and middle-income countries. Science will be crucial in addressing the global tobacco pandemic, and SRNT is uniquely positioned to further tobacco science and research capacity on a global basis.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

These disclosures provided emission data for 40 hazardous agents under both standard and intensive ISO testing conditions. Our analyses focused on ""adjusted emissions"" (i.e., emissions per milligram of nicotine yield) for 13 selected agents. Adjusted emissions differed significantly by ISO testing condition for 9 of the 13 selected agents. Intensive condition adjusted emissions were strongly negatively correlated for several agent pairs. Country and manufacturer variables were the strongest predictors of intensive condition adjusted emissions for 8 of the 13 selected agents and significant predictors for all of them. Taken together, these results suggest potential for the intent of emission limits to be undermined by risk swapping (in which one specific exposure is reduced within a group at the cost of another's exposure increasing) and risk shifting (in which a specific exposure is reduced within a group at the cost of that exposure's increasing within another group).","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

During this period the average inflation-adjusted price for menthol cigarettes increased 55.8%. Price elasticities from multivariate regression models suggest that this price increase led to an increase of 1.73% in sales-weighted average tar yields and a 1.28% increase in sales-weighted average nicotine yields for menthol cigarettes. The 50.5% price increase of nonmenthol varieties over the same period yielded an estimated increase of 1% in tar per cigarette but no statistically significant increase in nicotine yields. An ordered probit model of the impact of cigarette prices on cigarette strength (ultra-light, light, full flavor, unfiltered) offers an explanation: As cigarette prices increase, the probability that stronger cigarette types will be sold increases. This effect is larger for menthol than for nonmenthol cigarettes. Our results are consistent with earlier population-based cross-sectional and longitudinal studies showing that higher cigarette prices and taxes are associated with increasing consumption of higher-yield cigarettes by smokers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

One such non-nicotine effect includes sensory stimulation, which may promote smoking by developing learned associations with nicotine's rewarding effects, or by constituting a rewarding experience independent of nicotine. The present study used internal tobacco industry documents to examine industry efforts to understand and manipulate stimulation of the sensory nerves by tobacco smoke, and the influence of sensory stimulation on smoker behavior. Research focused on sensory nerves of the head and neck, including the olfactory nerve, which carries flavor and odor, and the trigeminal nerve, which carries irritant information. The tobacco industry maintained a systematic research program designed to elucidate an understanding of responses of sensory nerves to nicotine and other components of tobacco smoke, and attempted to develop nicotine-like compounds that would enhance sensory responses in smokers. Industry research appeared intended to aid in the development of new products with greater consumer appeal. The potential influence of sensory response in enhancing nicotine dependence through an associative mechanism was acknowledged by the tobacco industry, but evidence for research in this area was limited. These findings add to evidence of industry manipulation of sensory factors to enhance smoking behavior and may have implications for development of more effective treatment strategies, including more ""acceptable"" nicotine replacement therapies.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

As a result, the modern cigarette is uniquely effective at facilitating the absorption of nicotine as well as carcinogens and other toxins. The present study draws on internal tobacco company documents to assess industry consideration of the role of smoke particle size as a potentially controllable influence over inhalation patterns and lung exposure. Tobacco manufacturers evaluated particle size manipulation both as a means of controlling physical and sensory product attributes and as a possible approach to reducing health hazards related to exposure. Industry scientists concluded that the smoke aerosol particle distribution of conventional cigarettes, constructed within common parameters, falls within a narrow and effective inhalation range. However, the internal findings suggest that differences in smoke particle size distribution are possible through less conventional approaches to product design. We propose that particle size be included among the many design features to be considered in emerging tobacco product regulation. However, the present review does not address whether particle size regulation would be a plausible means of substantially reducing addictiveness or harmfulness of cigarettes, and therefore we do not propose it as a high-priority target for regulation.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Systematic keyword and opportunistic Web site searches were conducted on tobacco industry internal documents relevant to Japan, supplemented with relevant material from the tobacco trade and sociological literatures. Certain ""market quirks"" of the Japanese society benefited the tobacco industry in promoting its light and mild cigarettes. Japan's is a trend-conscious society with a penchant for new fashion and products. The Japanese are innovative, with the propensity to transform concepts into something characteristically their own marked by a distinct cultural style, such as the concept of keihaku tansho (""light-thin-short-small""). With big-budget sophisticated advertising, tobacco companies developed a lucrative market for mild, light, and ultra-low-tar cigarettes. Smokers had a preference for charcoal filters, which they believed protected them. Tar numbers meant little to smokers. The transnational tobacco companies capitalized on consumer concerns about the health hazards of smoking to promote low-tar cigarettes as a safer alternative. This may be one factor that explains why smoking prevalence in Japan remains high. Light and mild cigarettes are popular in Japan because Japanese smokers believe low tar/nicotine cigarette with charcoal filters protect them and help mollify their health concerns about smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Currently, a number of new brands are being test marketed, including Taboka, Marlboro Snus, Camel Snus, and Skoal Dry. We report here levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), alkaloids, anions, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and volatile aldehydes in these products, and compare them to the most popular traditional moist snuff brands. Total TSNAs averaged 1.97 microg/g dry weight tobacco in Taboka, Marlboro Snus, and Camel Snus, 4.54 microg/g tobacco in Skoal Dry, and 7.42 microg/g tobacco in traditional brands. The amounts of unprotonated nicotine averaged 0.961 mg/g tobacco in Taboka, Marlboro Snus, and Skoal Dry, 7.22 mg/g tobacco in Camel Snus, and 7.57 mg/g tobacco in traditional brands. Levels of minor tobacco alkaloids were relatively high in Taboka, Marlboro Snus, and Skoal Dry, as compared to other products analyzed here. Levels of nitrite and nitrate in new U.S. smokeless tobacco products and the Swedish snus General were lower than those in the other products. Remarkably high levels of chloride and some PAH were observed in the traditional moist snuff. Crotonaldehyde levels were about five times higher in Taboka and Marlboro Snus than in traditional products. The large variation in the levels of some toxicants and carcinogens analyzed here indicates that more effort is required from the U.S. tobacco industry to further reduce their amounts in new and traditional smokeless tobacco products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Menthol also is used at reduced levels in many nonmenthol brands. Public health research has suggested patterns of use of mentholated brands as a potential explanation for the health disparities between Black (largely menthol) and White (largely nonmenthol) smokers and has explored the effects of menthol on smoker behavior, consumption patterns, and consequent delivery of smoke constituents. However, relatively few published studies have directly examined the physiological impact and function of menthol delivery in cigarettes. In this study, we review internal tobacco industry documents to assess industry research on function and effects of menthol in cigarettes. Industry documents describe a range of physiological effects of menthol, with important implications for use and consumption patterns. These effects include altered perception of tobacco smoke and its constituents via cooling, smoothing, and anesthetic effects; increased impact through stimulation of trigeminal receptors; interaction with nicotine controlling its perception, delivery, and uptake; and increased respiratory irritation and toxic effects.

This review will summarize some of the seminal research findings relating to nicotine dependence and will highlight fundamental questions that must yet be answered. The evidence that nicotine is an addictive drug was summarized in the 1988 Report of the Surgeon General which concluded that nicotine fulfills the criteria for a dependence-producing drug. More recently, research has further characterized the pharmacological effects of nicotine in the brain and elucidated the basic pathophysiology of nicotine addition. Moreover, research shows that nicotine replacement therapy, such as nicotine patch or gum, can prevent or reverse withdrawal symptoms. It is also clear that the form of nicotine delivery is a major determinant of addiction potential and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products are both highly engineered drug delivery devices that act not only to provide users with controllable doses of nicotine, but also to maximize the addictive effects of nicotine. Along with the understanding of the dependence process has come a rapidly expanding arsenal of treatment for the disorder. There are many major questions about the nature and course of nicotine addiction that remain unanswered and must be addressed if we are to continue to improve our ability to prevent tobacco dependence as well as to provide more effective and acceptable options for treatment and disease prevention in those who are already addicted.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

To date, it is unknown whether Arab cigarette smokers are using or susceptible to HTPs. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the association between cigarette smoking behavior and the use of and susceptibility to HTPs in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Arab cigarette smokers (n = 628) from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, and Yemen were recruited using a convenience sampling technique. A cross-sectional survey comprised questions related to sociodemographic characteristics, cigarette smoking behavior characteristics (quitting attempts and desire to quit cigarette smoking, nicotine dependence, and consideration of switching to nicotine products with reduced health risks), and awareness of, use of, and susceptibility to use of HTPs. Descriptive and logistic regression models were used for analysis. The participants indicated a high frequency of past quitting attempts and a desire to quit smoking cigarettes. They were also considering switching to a nicotine product with reduced health risks. However, their awareness of HTPs was relatively low (24.2%), and the proportion of participants who had ever used HTPs or were currently using them was quite low as well (10.7% and 5.0%, respectively). A history of quit attempts was associated with more likely lifetime use of HTPs (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.21-5.71]). Nicotine-dependent cigarette smokers were more likely to be susceptible to HTP use (AOR = 1.12, 95% CI [1.01-1.24]). Moreover, those who would consider switching to a product that provided nicotine and could reduce health risks by 99% were more likely to be susceptible to using HTPs (AOR = 2.17, 95% CI [1.05-4.51]). Awareness of HTPs is relatively low among Arab cigarette smokers. Attempts to quit cigarette smoking, nicotine dependence, and the consideration of switching to a product that delivers nicotine with reduced health risks were significantly associated with using HTPs. The findings of this study provide potential for evidence-based treatment for smokers and will help prevent the use of tobacco industry tactics in marketing HTPs.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

TSNA typically form in tobacco during the post-harvest period, with some fraction being transferred into mainstream smoke when a cigarette is burned during use. The most studied of the TSNA is 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). NNK has been shown to be carcinogenic in laboratory animals. Studies examining the carcinogenicity of NNK frequently are conducted by injecting rodents with a single dose of 2.5 to 10 mumol of pure NNK; the amount of NNK contained in all of the mainstream smoke from about 3700 to 14,800 typical U.S. cigarettes. Extrapolated to a 70-kg smoker, the carcinogenic dose of pure NNK administered to rodents would be equivalent to the amount of NNK in all of the mainstream smoke of 22 to 87 million typical U.S. cigarettes. Furthermore, extrapolating results from rodent studies based on a single injection of pure NNK to establish a causative role for NNK in the carcinogenicity of chronic tobacco smoke exposure in humans is not consistent with basic pharmacological and toxicological principles. For example, such an approach fails to consider the effect of other smoke constituents upon the toxicity of NNK. In vitro studies demonstrate that nicotine, cotinine, and aqueous cigarette ""tar"" extract (ACTE) all inhibit the mutagenic activity of NNK. In vivo studies reveal that the formation of pulmonary DNA adducts in mice injected with NNK is inhibited by the administration of cotinine and mainstream cigarette smoke. Cigarette smoke has been shown to modulate the metabolism of NNK, providing a mechanism for the inhibitory effects of cigarette smoke and cigarette smoke constituents on NNK-induced tumorigenesis. NNK-related pulmonary DNA adducts have not been detected in rodents exposed to cigarette smoke, nor has the toxicity of tobacco smoke or tobacco smoke condensate containing marked reductions in TSNA concentrations been shown to be reduced in any biological assay. In summary, there is no experimental evidence to suggest that reduction of TSNA will reduce the mutagenic, cytotoxic, or carcinogenic potential of tobacco smoke.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Inside the branding of light cigarettes and targeting youth in Brazil.,"This study aimed to understand how the internal strategies of British American Tobacco (BAT) selling 'light' cigarettes to young people in Brazil may inform current global efforts to promote new tobacco and nicotine products. We reviewed industry documents in the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents (TTID) Library. In 1976, Philip Morris and BAT introduced 'low tar' or 'light' cigarettes in Brazil to maintain and attract new young smokers. At the time it was a novel tobacco product that implied lower health risks. While an initial push for 'light' cigarettes in Brazil did not materialise in the 1970s, BAT launched a new 'light' cigarette, Free, in 1984, with a marketing campaign consisting of symbols of personal freedom and choice to attract young people. In the mid-1990s, BAT used the success in Brazil to expand the lights segment throughout Latin America. BAT drove the lights segment through brand marketing and claims of a healthier alternative. As tobacco companies introduce and market new tobacco and nicotine products, mixing health and imagery messages, governments should recognise aggressive brand marketing messaging to attract new tobacco users and ensure that marketing regulations are enforced.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

While the smoking prevalence has declined over the past 50 years, those with mental illness and addictive disorders continue to smoke at high levels and with significant tobacco-related health problems. Areas covered: This review highlights the epidemiology, contributing factors, and evidence-base for intervening upon tobacco use in those with mental illness and addictive disorders. Historically underprioritized, a growing body of literature supports treating tobacco within mental health and addiction treatment settings. Critically, treating tobacco use appears to support, and not harm, mental health recovery and sobriety. This review also summarizes novel, emerging approaches to mitigate the harms of cigarette smoking. Expert commentary: People with mental illness and addictive disorders have a high prevalence of tobacco use with serious health harms. Treating tobacco use is essential. Evidence-based strategies include individual treatments that are stage-matched to readiness to quit and combine cessation medications with behavioral therapies, supported by smoke-free policies in treatment settings and residential environments. Emerging approaches, with a focus on harm reduction, are electronic nicotine delivery systems and tobacco regulatory efforts to reduce the nicotine content in cigarettes, thereby reducing their addiction potential.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Although the literature widely describes the harmfulness of tobacco and the content of toxic substances in tobacco products, the topic is often treated selectively as relating primarily to cigarettes and rarely extends to other products of the broadly defined tobacco industry. However, there is no reason to marginalize the harmful effects of other nicotine products, (which include tobacco products such as cigars). The study analyzed the available literature on the content of selected heavy metals in cigar tobacco. Among the heavy metals, the following contents of elements in tobacco were recorded in cigars: Fe (420-2200 µg/g), Mn (100-370 µg/g), Zn (14-180 µg/g), Cu (15-140 µg/g), Pb (not detected-32 µg/g), Cd (nd-19 µg/g), Ni (nd-13 µg/g), Cr (nd-10 µg/g), Co (0.65-1.0 µg/g), As (nd-0.66 µg/g), Hg (18-25 ng/g).

We analyzed sentiment, likes, or retweet to followers ratios, and the posts coming from the casual users to find pieces of news that could affect the discourse. Tweets coming from industry were analyzed manually. We analyzed n = 33,890 tweets on COVID-19 and smoking. The sentiment of tweets was negative, hitting a nadir in mid-March, but became less negative in April when preprints suggesting benefits from smoking on COVID-19 were released. Similar trends were observed for the ratios of likes or retweets to followers. We found 58 messages from the tobacco industry concerning COVID-19. Twenty-two (37.9 percent) mentioned the efforts of tobacco companies to support the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Two tweets included Food and Drug Administration statements that there is no evidence that vaping increases the risk of COVID-19. The occurrence of preprints suggesting benefits of smoking in COVID-19 might increase sentiment and reactions to tweets on tobacco products and the virus.

Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound is an HMO serving more than 385,000 enrollees in western Washington State. Group Health established a smoking-cessation program in 1985. The smoking-cessation benefit consists of interventions by providers to determine smoking status, a formal behavioral modification program, and nicotine-replacement therapy (beginning in 1993) for patients undergoing behavioral modification. The behavioral modification program is offered in group or individualized format. A team of trained nursing, medical, and pharmacy staff members provides consultative support to the program's smoking-cessation specialists. A tobacco-use road-map team has been created as part of the quality-improvement effort at Group Health; a pharmacist serves on this team. The ultimate goal of the team is to reduce the percentage of adult enrollees who smoke from the current 20% to 12.5% by 2000. A procedure for promoting smoking cessation was presented to all the pharmacists, along with continuing-education sessions. The pharmacists are encouraged to be brief but consistent in their antismoking message and to apply the ""four A's"" (ask about the patient's smoking status, advise the patient to quit smoking, assist in the patient's efforts to quit, and arrange follow-up). The inclusion of nicotine-replacement products in the smoking-cessation program in 1993 provided pharmacists with a key role in determining dosages and monitoring patients. Although the program is leading many smokers to quit, efforts will have to be intensified if program goals are to be realized by 2000.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Despite being lower in tar yield, and consequently in squamo-carcinogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo[a]pyrene, the nitrosamine yields are often higher than they need to be. Also, reductions in tar levels have not led to the consequential reductions in mortality that were anticipated several decades ago. The modern cigarette is also smoother, easier to smoke and to learn how to smoke, highly addictive and facilitates compensatory smoking. Compensatory smoking leads to excess inhalation of carcinogens and toxins in the hunt for nicotine. Its labelling is misleading in that supposedly low-yielding cigarettes may, due to compensation occurring as a result of cigarette design, lead to inhalation of much higher amounts of nicotine, carcinogens and toxins than the smoker is led to expect. Regulation of the product is needed to provide the persistent smoker with a cigarette lower in risk, accurately labelled, providing a relatively consistent and known dose of nicotine, and less likely to facilitate compensatory smoking. This will not produce a safe cigarette but should result in a reduction in harm if seriously implemented.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Yet, the associations between ADHD and cardiometabolic risk profile, participation in non-pharmacological interventions, and long-term outcomes in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) remain unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: This observational study involved patients from the SWEDEHEART (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) registry, aged 18-74 years old, diagnosed with their first acute MI from 2006 to 2020. We assessed the associations between ADHD and cardiometabolic risk profile (clinical parameters, disease histories, and behavioural factors), engagement in guideline-recommended non-pharmacological interventions, recurrent cardiovascular events, and mortality. We analysed adults with MI with ADHD (n = 582) and without ADHD (n = 2704). Most clinical parameters and disease histories did not differ significantly between groups. However, patients with ADHD had higher risks of smoking (risk ratio, RR = 1.53; 95% confidence interval 1.36-1.71] and snus use (RR = 1.65; 1.36-1.99), were less likely to participate in follow-up evaluations (RR = 0.87; 0.79-0.96), or to stop smoking after MI (RR = 0.76; 0.63-0.91). They had a higher rate of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 2.02; 1.05-3.88) after discharge, but not recurrent cardiovascular events.

Since May 2016, the Tobacco Products Directive 2014/40/EU (TPD2) prohibits ECAPS in various advertising channels, including media that have cross-border effects. The objective of this study was to investigate changes in exposure to ECAPS in a cohort of smokers from six European Union member states after implementation of TPD2. METHODS: Self-reported exposure to ECAPS overall and in various media and localities was examined over two International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation survey waves (2016 and 2018) in a cohort of 6011 adult smokers from Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Spain (EUREST-PLUS Project) using longitudinal generalized estimating equations models. RESULTS: Self-reported ECAPS exposure at both timepoints varied between countries and across examined advertising channels. Overall, there was a significant increase in ECAPS exposure [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.25, 95% CI: 1.09-1.44]. Between waves, no consistent patterns of change in ECAPS exposure across countries and different media were observed. Generally, ECAPS exposure tended to decline in some channels regulated by TPD2, particularly on television and radio, while exposure tended to increase in some unregulated channels, such as at points of sale. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the TPD2 was generally effective in reducing ECAPS in regulated channels. Nonetheless, further research is warranted to evaluate its role in reducing ECAPS exposure, possibly by triangulation with additional sources of data.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

From kings' and nobles' exclusive use, it gradually and progressively became popular among the public, as a new player. Eighty-eight years ago (1929), Fritz Linkint, an extraordinary researcher in Germany, while reviewing existing evidence regarding a wide range of cancers potentially caused by smoking, indicated that smoking was a cause of respiratory disease. Despite the overwhelming accumulated evidence of the negative effects of nicotine intake, the prevalence of tobacco use is not expected to decline in the near future. What have we missed thus far in the game that claims more than seven million deaths annually worldwide? Although tobacco use is recognized as a major health problem, the persistent habit creates a dissonance between public health initiatives to reduce tobacco consumption and the choices citizens are making. To understand this dissonance, consideration first must be given to the social meaning attributed to smoking. Second, the political dissonance between health imperatives and social agendas is discussed with regard to relevant theory. Third, health promotion strategies can make a strong contribution to win the game from a negentropic perspective, that is to say, a public health vision that is structured towards an overarching goal.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Relevant health organizations were identified within Australia for policy searching (n = 156), which identified 47 unique policy documents. After contacting 267 key stakeholders from eligible organizations, 31 survey responses were analysed. Research organizations and universities were highly represented in both the policy and survey data. Most health research stakeholders recognized that vaping industry interests counteract public health priorities and opposed vaping industry participation. However, many organizations lacked clear, vaping industry-specific participation policies. To protect the integrity of the emerging evidence base around vaping harms which inform vaping policy, health organizations require strong, comprehensive policies to resist vaping industry participation in research.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

While the tobacco and vaping industry has promoted vaping as a smoking cessation aid for adults, the industry has strategically targeted young people through marketing and appealing designs to orientate a new generation of consumers to use their products. These strategies are not new and replicate what we have previously seen employed by the tobacco industry in past decades to maintain and grow their tobacco profits. We review the evidence on tobacco and vaping industry interference, highlighting the calculated and strategic use of interference tactics as a discourse to curb tobacco control efforts. We demonstrate how these tried and tested strategies are now being purposefully re-used in the context of vaping. As Australia is currently undergoing significant policy reforms for the access and retail of vaping products, we also provide a case study of the industry response played out in this contemporary landscape. Government and public health advocates are in a key position to be one step ahead in proactively tackling the vaping crisis. We recommend that continued monitoring of industry activities and strategies, achieving political transparency and tightening loopholes in current regulations are all needed to identify and eliminate the tobacco and vaping industry's influence on policymaking. Given their previous track record, we emphasize the need to counter industry interference tactics with urgency to prevent a new generation of nicotine dependence and to support and protect future action in tobacco control.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Governments have begun to tighten regulation principally to prevent uptake by young people and non-smokers. As tobacco industry ownership of the e-cigarette market grows, it is important to be aware of how industry is seeking to influence the regulation of e-cigarettes. Using thematic analysis, this research examines the explicit arguments and implicit tactics used in responses from the tobacco industry and linked organizations to Scotland's 2022 consultation 'Vaping Products-Tightening Rules on Advertising and Promoting'. The themes that emerged in the analysis were compared to tactics and arguments identified in past research on the tobacco industry to look for continuations and divergences. While the research finds continuation of historic arguments and tactics being used in the submissions, it also highlights important novel tactics and framings employed by tobacco industry actors, including incorporating outdated data and calling for UK-wide policy despite this being a devolved issue. Policymakers must remain alert to the strategies being used by the tobacco industry, so they are able to prioritize public health rather than the interests of industries that put profit before health.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Despite it being illegal for Australian retailers to sell nicotine pouches, the products have been seized in government enforcement raids of Australian retailers, and have also been promoted to young people by Australian social media influencers. The Australian Federal Government has recognized and expressed concern about the rising profile of nicotine pouches in Australia and the promotion of these products as unproven vaping and smoking cessation aids. Yet to date, there has been no published research on nicotine pouches in Australia. Using focus group and interview data collected in early 2024 as part of Generation Vape, an ongoing Australian national study into adolescent and young adult vaping and smoking, we explored their attitudes to and perceptions of nicotine pouches, including first-hand experiences and drivers of use. The participants perceived an increase in the use and popularity of oral nicotine pouches, including PMI's Zyn brand, for reasons including claimed sport performance enhancement, vaping cessation and as part of partying and clubbing culture. Some participants perceived nicotine pouches to be a 'healthier' alternative to smoking or vaping. It is critical that research on nicotine pouches is collected now to inform public health policy and to prevent the proliferation of a new class of addictive recreational nicotine products in Australia.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

It is important to be aware of the tobacco industry's involvement and stated aims for e-cigarettes in the UK, given their historical attempts to divert attention from and escape responsibility for the harms caused by combustible cigarettes. The use of e-cigarettes amongst young people in the UK has remained constant, despite the law prohibiting sales to adolescents and claims by manufacturers and others that they are designed solely as a tool to quit smoking. This study sought to examine how tobacco-related organizations in the UK e-cigarette market frame the use of e-cigarettes. Publicly available materials between September 2015 and June 2023 were collected from four transnational tobacco companies which have invested in the e-cigarette category, and from a UK e-cigarette trade association. A qualitative framing analysis of materials was conducted guided by relevant frameworks from the Commercial Determinants of Health literature. The analysis identified seven framings used by tobacco-related organizations relevant to e-cigarette usage in the UK. These were: co-opting of harm reduction; consumer choice; following the 'evidence'; insufficient evidence; the right kind of regulation; 'us' and 'them' rhetoric and marketing and advertising. By highlighting tobacco-related organizations' e-cigarette framings and contradictions, this study raises awareness of the rhetorical strategies used by the industry which aim to relegitimize tobacco companies in the political and public spheres.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

We aimed to investigate associations between individual, social, and environmental factors and e-cigarette never-use (hereafter referred to as never-use) among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents in 2018. This was a cross-sectional analysis of Wave 11 data from the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children (N = 440). Poisson regression was used to calculate prevalence ratios of never-use in relation to individual, social, and environmental factors. Never-use was reported by 89.3% of adolescents; 2.5% reported e-cigarette use with nicotine in the last 12 months. Never-use was associated with not using other substances (cigarettes, alcohol, or marijuana), positive social relationships as well as supportive home and education environments. We did not identify significant associations between e-cigarette use and (1) individual factors: suicidal ideation and physical activity; or e-cigarette use and (2) family factors: caregivers' perception of the child's friends and schooling. Never-use was common within a cohort of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents aged 12-15 years and was associated with supportive peer groups, school, and community environments. The factors identified as protective against e-cigarette use largely mirror those protective against cigarette use in this population.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This article presents a transformative abolitionist public health framework, grounded in Indigenous-led principles of sovereignty, truth-telling, love, and justice. It aims to dismantle the structural drivers of harm perpetuated by the industry. We centre abolition as a moral and ethical imperative, but also as a practical necessity to uphold the human right to health, restore Indigenous authority, and eliminate systems that commodify addiction and death. Drawing on Indigenous health paradigms and abolitionist theory, we outline practical, policy-facing pathways to abolition. These include divesting from harm, reinvesting in care, defunding industry influence, and embedding reparative justice. Examples include legal liability mechanisms, profit caps, truth-telling commissions, trade reform, and Indigenous-led health infrastructure. We distinguish abolition from prohibition, framing it as a strategic, relational, and system-wide response that invests in life-affirming alternatives rather than punitive control. At the heart of this framework is love, a radical commitment to healing, collective well-being, and restoring power and agency to communities most harmed. Rather than placing responsibility on individuals, this framework offers a systems-wide approach to public health that targets the structural drivers of harm. This article contributes a new model for health-generative public policy, advancing abolition as an urgent strategy for equity, truth, and planetary and human health.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, the commercial Tobacco and Nicotine Industry continues to promote, market, and sell tobacco and nicotine products to protect and expand profit. This reflects their legal obligation to act in shareholders' best interests. While the Tobacco and Nicotine Industry heavily promotes alternative products such as electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches, for now, these represent a relatively small share of profits compared with combustible cigarette sales. The continued reliance on and expansion of these markets generates addiction, dependence, and a range of harms. These actions represent a modern manifestation of colonization-reproducing control and exploitation that affects people at all levels, particularly Indigenous peoples, whose lands, knowledges, and well-being have long been commodified and targeted. The Tobacco and Nicotine Industry and their collaborators employ misleading strategies, including co-opting terms like 'harm reduction' and making vague promises about a 'smoke-free' or 'noncombustible' future. These tactics distract from the continued promotion and sale of harmful products under the guise of public health and harm reduction. This narrative reframes structural and commercial determinants of health as matters of individual choice and enables the continued production of Tobacco and Nicotine Industry-driven harms. Everyone has the right to health, and it is crucial to have effective tobacco control and resistance programs and policies. Governments have a duty to protect people's health by preventing the creation of new generations addicted to people-harming products. Given the ongoing and disproportionate impact of tobacco and nicotine-related disease and death-particularly for Indigenous peoples-there is an urgent need for structural change to eradicate these harms and dismantle colonial and commercial systems that sustain them.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Although Aotearoa is a Party to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, tobacco companies could participate in policy consultation processes and lobbied strongly against the endgame policies. Using an Official Information Act request, we obtained submissions made during the final consultation phase (on regulations that would have implemented the policies). We focused on 13 submissions made by tobacco companies, groups or individuals understood to have received industry funding (directly or indirectly), and groups that have roles within the nicotine product supply chain. We analysed arguments opposing the retail outlet reduction measure, which aimed to make smoked tobacco products substantially less accessible. Using the Policy Dystopia Model as a framework, we identified arguments that mapped to the PDM's economic, legal and political domains. Submitters stated the policy would impose serious costs, particularly on retailers; they anticipated illicit tobacco trade escalating, a consequence they predicted would harm communities and reduce public safety. We identified two over-arching themes: unfairness and promoting self-interest. Tobacco companies' ability to participate in consultation processes questions whether Aotearoa's implementation of Article 5.3 of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control adequately protects public health policy-making from tobacco companies' influence. Stronger regulation of lobbying should set greater transparency requirements, monitor and critique industry activity, and implement a robust code of conduct.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Manufacturers, including transnational tobacco companies (TTCs), have faced criticism for designing and marketing products that appeal to youth and have a considerable environmental footprint. In response, a UK-wide ban on single-use e-cigarettes was implemented in June 2025. While industry resistance to health policy is well documented, this is the first study to examine how TTCs and TTC-linked actors responded to regulation framed around both health and environmental objectives. We analysed 21 submissions to three public consultations from four TTCs and 10 TTC-linked organizations. Drawing on a taxonomy of framing strategies from an evidence-based corporate political activity framework, we explored how these actors sought to shape policymakers' perceptions of the problem and its solutions. TTCs and TTC-linked organizations positioned themselves as responsible actors aligned with public health and environmental goals while opposing the ban. Youth use and environmental harms were reframed as problems of individual noncompliance and enforcement failure. The ban was portrayed as disproportionate, procedurally flawed, economically harmful, and likely to increase illicit trade and tobacco use. Industry-preferred alternatives included measures targeting individual behaviour and product innovation. These findings add to evidence of a disconnect between TTCs' claimed transformation and their continued resistance to regulation. Close collaboration between public health and environmental advocates is needed to pre-empt and counter industry framing and influence, and to advance regulation that promotes public and planetary health.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In the last half century, the tobacco industry became interested in this connection, and conducted and supported psychiatric and basic science research on the mental health implications of smoking, long before most mental health professionals outside the industry investigated this issue. Initially, representatives of tobacco industry research organizations supported genetics and psychosomatic research to try to disprove findings that smoking causes lung cancer. Tobacco industry research leaders engaged with investigators because of shared priorities and interests in the brain effects of nicotine. By the 1980s, collaborative funding programs and individual company research and development teams engaged in intramural and extramural basic science studies on the neuropharmacology of nicotine. When mental health researchers outside the industry became interested in the issue of the mentally ill and smoking in the mid-1990s, they increasingly explained it in terms of a disease of nicotine addiction. Both the idea that smoking/nicotine does something positive for the mentally ill and the conclusion that it is the result of nicotine dependence have the potential to support corporate agendas (tobacco or pharmaceutical).","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now has the authority to regulate cigarette design if doing so would improve public health. To support a potential regulatory action, two weight-of-evidence reviews were applied for causally relating filter ventilation to lung adenocarcinoma. Published scientific literature (3284 citations) and internal tobacco company documents contributed to causation analysis evidence blocks and the identification of research gaps. Filter ventilation was adopted in the mid-1960s and was initially equated with making a cigarette safer. Since then, lung adenocarcinoma rates paradoxically increased relative to other lung cancer subtypes. Filter ventilation 1) alters tobacco combustion, increasing smoke toxicants; 2) allows for elasticity of use so that smokers inhale more smoke to maintain their nicotine intake; and 3) causes a false perception of lower health risk from ""lighter"" smoke. Seemingly not supportive of a causal relationship is that human exposure biomarker studies indicate no reduction in exposure, but these do not measure exposure in the lung or utilize known biomarkers of harm. Altered puffing and inhalation may make smoke available to lung cells prone to adenocarcinomas. The analysis strongly suggests that filter ventilation has contributed to the rise in lung adenocarcinomas among smokers. Thus, the FDA should consider regulating its use, up to and including a ban. Herein, we propose a research agenda to support such an effort.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We also consider population health implications, which we argue are essential to a comprehensive analysis of the impact on consumers. Although the FTC antitrust investigation has focused on closed vaping systems, we argue that the relevant market is the broader nicotine delivery product market, which includes all vaping products along with tobacco products. With Altria having a large market share in the key nicotine delivery product submarkets and with important entry barriers, the merger potentially places Altria in a dominant position in the relevant market. In particular, competition in the vaping submarket is reduced, thereby likely to reduce the availability of less harmful alternatives to cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We used a stratified random design to conduct a digit-dialed telephone survey in 2002 among 9,674 New York City adults. Our main outcome measures included prevalence of cigarette smoking, exposure to second-hand smoke, the response of smokers to state tax increases, and cessation practices. Even after controlling for sociodemographic factors (age, race/ethnicity, income, education, marital status, employment status, and foreign-born status) smoking rates were highest in Central Harlem and in the South Bronx. Sixteen percent of nonsmokers reported frequent exposure to second-hand smoke at home or in a workplace. Among smokers with a child with asthma, only 33% reported having a no-smoking policy in their homes. More than one fifth of smokers reported reducing the number of cigarettes they smoked in response to the state tax increase. Of current smokers who tried to quit, 65% used no cessation aid. These data were used to inform New York City's smoke-free legislation, taxation, public education, and a free nicotine patch give-away program. In conclusion, large, local surveys can provide essential data to effectively advocate for, plan, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive tobacco control program.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

AIMS AND METHODS: Participants were 135 adolescents of age 13-18 (52.6% female, mean age = 15.3) in California. Participants viewed six social media posts online in a 2 (post source: peer or advertisement) × 2 (e-cigarette content exposure: heavy or light) between-subjects design. Analyses were weighted to population benchmarks. We examined adolescents' beliefs, willingness, and intention to use e-cigarettes in association with social media use intensity in daily life and with experimentally manipulated exposure to social media posts that varied by source (peer or advertisement) and content (e-cigarette heavy or light). RESULTS: Greater social media use in daily life was associated with greater willingness and intention to use e-cigarettes and more positive attitudes, greater perceived norms, and lower perceived danger of e-cigarette use (all p-values <.01). In tests of the experimental exposures, heavy (vs. light) e-cigarette content resulted in greater intention (p = .049) to use e-cigarettes and more positive attitudes (p = .019). Viewing advertisements (vs. peer-generated posts) resulted in greater willingness and intention (p-values <.01) to use e-cigarettes, more positive attitudes (p = .003), and greater norm perceptions (p = .009). The interaction effect of post source by post content was not significant for any of the outcomes (all p-values >.529). CONCLUSIONS: Greater social media use and heavier exposure to advertisements and e-cigarette content in social media posts are associated with a greater risk for e-cigarette use among adolescents. Regulatory action is needed to prohibit sponsored e-cigarette content on social media platforms used by youth. IMPLICATIONS: Adolescents who use social media intensely may be at higher risk for e-cigarette use. Even brief exposure to e-cigarette content on social media was associated with greater intention to use and more positive attitudes toward e-cigarettes. Regulatory action should be taken to prohibit sponsored e-cigarette content on social media used by young people, including posts by influencers who appeal to young people.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

As per FDA comments, this provision pertains to visual ads communicated via social media, raising questions about compliance within the large e-liquid promotion community on Instagram. AIMS AND METHODS: This study examines use of warnings on promotional Instagram posts before and after provisions took effect on August 10, 2018. Netlytic was used to gather a sample of 500 promotional #eliquid and #ejuice posts from: May 2017, October 2017, March 2018, August 2018, and September 2018. The 1500 prewarning and 1000 postwarning posts were coded using content analysis. Changes in products and marketing strategies were also considered. Post volume was tracked monthly between May 2017 and February 2020. RESULTS: In the prewarning period, nicotine warning statements were absent on all posts. Following August 10, 2018, FDA compliant warnings were present on 13.6% of posts. Among US-based posts, 36.4% used the warnings, with warnings more common on posts made by e-liquid brands (52.3%) and posts promoting e-liquids with nicotine (40.0%). Promotional strategies and products did not significantly change. The share of posts made by US Instagram users decreased by 11%, although total post volume continued to grow. CONCLUSIONS: Many e-liquid promotion posts on Instagram remained noncompliant with nicotine warnings after FDA provisions took effect. The large volume of international users also limited the impact of FDA-mandated warnings on the social media environment. IMPLICATIONS: Further guidance and enforcement are needed to ensure that US e-liquid marketers on visual social media platforms adhere to current provisions, particularly for individual social media users who are sponsored by industry. The inherently global span of social media also indicates the importance of a shared approach to marketing regulations. Further work is needed to assess enforcement strategies viable for the social media environment.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Although pharmacotherapies have been shown to have a moderate short-term benefit as a quitting aid, substantial cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric safety concerns have been identified in adverse-reporting databases, leading to prescription label warnings by Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, recent studies indicate these warnings may be without merit. This study examined the comparative safety of medications commonly used to aid smoking cessation. AIMS AND METHODS: Population-based retrospective cohort study using B.C. administrative data to assess the relative safety between varenicline, bupropion, and nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs). The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular hospitalizations. Secondary outcomes included mortality, a composite of neuropsychiatric hospitalizations, and individual components of the primary outcome. Statistical analysis used propensity score-adjusted log-binomial regression models. A sensitivity analysis excluded patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: The study included 116 442 participants. Compared with NRT, varenicline was associated with a 10% 1-year relative risk decrease of cardiovascular hospitalization (adjusted risk ratio [RR] = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82 to 1.00), a 20% 1-year relative risk decrease of neuropsychiatric hospitalization (RR: 0.80, CI: 0.7 to 0.89), and a 19% 1-year relative risk decrease of mortality (RR: 0.81, CI: 0.71 to 0.93). We found no significant association between NRT and bupropion for cardiovascular hospitalizations, neuropsychiatric hospitalizations, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with NRT, varenicline is associated with fewer serious adverse events and bupropion the same number of serious adverse events. IMPLICATIONS: This study addresses the need for comparative safety evidence in a real-world setting of varenicline and bupropion against an active comparator. Compared with NRT, varenicline was associated with a decreased risk of mortality, serious cardiovascular events, and neuropsychiatric events during the treatment, or shortly after the treatment, in the general population of adults seeking pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation. These results provide support for the removal of the varenicline boxed warning for neuropsychiatric events and add substantively to the cardiovascular safety findings of previous observational studies and randomized clinical trials.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

This study has two aims: (1) to determine when cigarette manufacturers had the technical capability to reduce cigarette nicotine content and (2) to estimate the lost public health benefits of implementing a standard in 1965, 1975, or 1985. METHODS: To determine the technical capability of cigarette companies, we reviewed public patents and internal cigarette company business records using the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents. To evaluate the impact of a very low nicotine content cigarette (VLNC) standard on smoking attributable deaths (SADs) and life-years lost (LYLs), we applied a validated (CISNET) model that uses past smoking data, along with estimates of the potential impact of VLNCs derived from expert elicitation. RESULTS: Cigarette manufacturers recognized that cigarettes were deadly and addictive before 1964. Manufacturers have had the technical capability to lower cigarette nicotine content for decades. Our model projected that a standard implemented in 1965 could have averted 21 million SADs (54% reduction) and 272 million LYLs (64% reduction) from 1965 to 2064, a standard implemented in 1975 could have averted 18.9 million SADs and 245.4 million LYLs from 1975 to 2074, and a standard implemented in 1985 could have averted 16.3 million SADs and 211.5 million LYLs from 1985 to 2084. CONCLUSIONS: Millions of premature deaths could have been averted if companies had only sold VLNCs decades ago. FDA should act immediately to implement a VLNC standard. IMPLICATIONS: Prior research has shown that a mandated reduction in the nicotine content of cigarettes could reduce the prevalence of smoking and improve public health. Here we report that cigarette manufacturers have had the ability to voluntarily implement such a standard for decades. We use a well-validated model to demonstrate that millions of smoking attributable deaths and life-years lost would have been averted if the industry had implemented such a standard.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The impact of future MRTP claims may depend on whether they are noticed, believed, and lead to smokers switching products. This study provides baseline data about smokers' exposure to perceived MRTP claims ahead of any MRTP authorizations. AIMS AND METHODS: We analyzed measures from Wave 3 of the US-based Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study which asked smokers to indicate if they had seen any e-cigarettes, snus, or other smokeless tobacco (SLT) products that claim to be ""less harmful"" in the past 12 months, and their likelihood of using products with these claims in the next 30 days. RESULTS: Significantly fewer smokers noted having seen snus (5.1%) or other SLT (5.6%) with ""less harmful"" claims compared with e-cigarettes (29.1%). For each product, the prevalence of MRTP claim exposure was higher among smokers who perceived the product to be less harmful than smoking, who currently used the product, and who had higher rates of tobacco advertising exposure at the point of sale. Among smokers who noticed products with ""less harmful"" claims, about one-quarter said they would use them in the future (24%-27%). CONCLUSIONS: Ahead of any Food & Drug Administration (FDA) authorization for MRTP claims, some smokers already perceive exposure to ""less harmful"" claims for e-cigarettes, but few do for SLT. MRTP claims may motivate some smokers to use these products. IMPLICATIONS: This study provides new baseline data about smokers' perceived exposure to MRTP claims in the United States ahead of any regulatory claim authorization. Using data from Wave 3 of the US PATH study, we found that some smokers already perceive exposure to ""less harmful"" claims for e-cigarettes (29%), but few do for SLT (5%-6%). Among smokers who noticed products with ""less harmful"" claims, about one-quarter said they would use them in the future (24%-27%), suggesting MRTP claims may motivate some smokers to use products described as ""less harmful.""","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

We report SLT sales trends in the U.S. by analyzing retail market scanner data from 2011 through 2019. METHODS: National SLT sales data were obtained from Nielsen's Convenience Track System for January 2011 to December 2019. UPC codes were used to classify products by attributes including type, parent company, brand, form, and flavor. Market share was calculated as percentage of total unit sales. Detailed product analysis was presented for moist snuff, snus, and tobacco-free nicotine products. RESULTS: SLT sales increased by 5.8% between 2011 and 2016 but declined by 3.9% from 2016 to 2019. Moist snuff sales increased by 8.1% between 2011 and 2016 and then declined 7.4% from 2016 to 2019 but still accounted for roughly 90% of the overall market annually. Between 2011 and 2019, snus sales consistently increased while sales of chew, dry snuff, and dissolvables decreased. Tobacco-free nicotine products emerged in 2016 and captured 4.0% of the market by 2019. Portion pouch packaging and flavors showed consistent growth although their popularity varied by the type of smokeless product. CONCLUSION: This study extends our previous work on U.S. SLT market trends through 2019. Overall sales increased between 2011 and 2016 but there were signs of leveling off including declining sales of moist snuff. Newer products continue to gain market share. Continued monitoring of SLT sales is needed, particularly given the new modified risk status of several products. IMPLICATIONS: This study analyzed the last 9 years of smokeless tobacco market data (2011-2019) to describe recent trends in sales. Overall, the smokeless product category is quite resilient although signs suggest downward trends among some product categories and features. New types of smokeless tobacco products (eg, snus and tobacco-free nicotine pouches) account for a growing share of the market.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Direct-mail advertising and coupon redemption have been linked to increased tobacco use, and efforts to promote SLT through direct-mail advertising may contribute to sustained SLT use. We examined reach of SLT direct-mail advertisements by recipient demographics and promotional features, including coupons. METHODS: Direct-mail data (n = 418) were acquired from Comperemedia (Mintel) and coded for product type (traditional [eg, chewing tobacco], pouched [eg, moist snuff, snus], or both [traditional SLT and any pouched SLT products]); promotions (eg, coupons); flavors; and themes (eg, masculinity). Using Mintel's volume estimates for number of pieces sent, we calculated the proportion of mail volume sent by recipient demographics (age, income, region) and advertising features across product type. RESULTS: Between July 2017 and August 2018, tobacco companies sent an estimated 249 million pieces of SLT direct-mail to US households; approximately half (49.6%) featured pouched SLT products. Across product types, over 75% of mail volume was sent to 31- to 60-year-old adults and 30-40% was sent to low-income households. The majority (>70%) of pouched SLT product mail contained coupons and flavor promotions. Outdoor and blue-collar-lifestyle themes were prominent in advertisements for all product types, along with less common adventure- and fun-related appeals. CONCLUSIONS: Coupons, flavors, and a combination of blue-collar and fun/adventure message themes were used to promote traditional and pouched SLT products through direct-mail, particularly to low-income households. Results support limits on direct-mail coupon distribution and continued surveillance of marketing appeals. IMPLICATIONS: There is a long history of research into tobacco advertising practices, largely focusing on cigarettes. This study highlights specific direct-mail marketing tactics used by the tobacco industry, including coupons to promote SLT products across the United States. Given the limited success in reducing SLT use and the association between direct-mail promotions and tobacco use, these study results provide support for policies to restrict use of coupons in direct-to-consumer tobacco marketing and indicate the need for continued surveillance of direct-mail advertisements as the SLT market continues to evolve.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Few studies have investigated the FDA-mandated and other warnings on social media. This study examined the prevalence and content of warning statements in e-cigarette-related YouTube videos. METHODS: In 2019, The Virginia Commonwealth University Center for the Study of Tobacco Products conducted bi-monthly (February-June) YouTube searches by relevance and view count to identify e-cigarette-related videos. Overall, 178 videos met the inclusion criteria. Staff coded each video for the presence of a visual/verbal warning statement, warning statement type (eg, FDA-mandated, addiction/tobacco, safety/toxic exposure, health effects), sponsorship, and tobacco product characteristics. A data extraction tool collected the video URL, title, upload date, and number of views, likes/dislikes, and comments. RESULTS: Only 5.1% of videos contained FDA-mandated and 21.9% contained non-mandated warnings. All videos with FDA-mandated and 46.2% of non-mandated warnings were represented visually. Only 13.1% of industry-sponsored videos uploaded after the mandate effective date had an FDA-mandated warning statement and videos with FDA-mandated and non-mandated (v. no) warnings had significantly fewer views, likes, dislikes, and comments. Among all non-mandated warnings, 31.3% featured an addiction/tobacco, 18.8% a safety/toxic exposure, and 37.5% a health effects warning. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of FDA-mandated warning statements in e-cigarette related YouTube videos was low. FDA enforcement of the warning statement mandate on YouTube could increase the public's understanding of the addictive nature of nicotine in e-cigarettes. IMPLICATIONS: The FDA has the authority to regulate the advertisement and promotion of e-cigarettes on the Internet. These data can inform future FDA requirements related to the language content and visual representation of addiction/tobacco, safety/exposure, and health effects warning statements that appear in YouTube videos and other visual social media popular among young people. Such data would help consumers make informed decisions about purchasing e-cigarette products, using e-cigarettes, and avoiding unintentional harm related to e-cigarettes. In addition, these data may help social media platforms make decisions on whether they will prohibit advertisements that promote or facilitate the sale of tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

AIMS AND METHODS: Here we review the sensory effects of nicotine and the underlying neurobiological processes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine elicits oral irritation and pain via the activation of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed by trigeminal nociceptors. These nociceptors excite neurons in the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc) and other brainstem regions in a manner that is significantly reduced by the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine. Vc neurons are excited by lingual application of nicotine and exhibit a progressive decline in firing to subsequent applications, consistent with desensitization of peripheral sensory neurons and progressively declining ratings of oral irritation in human psychophysical experiments. Nicotine also elicits a nAChR-mediated bitter taste via excitation of gustatory afferents. Nicotine solutions are avoided even when sweeteners are added. Studies employing oral self-administration have yielded mixed results: Some studies show avoidance of nicotine while others report increased nicotine intake over time, particularly in adolescents and females. Nicotine is consistently reported to increase human pain threshold and tolerance levels. In animal studies, nicotine is antinociceptive when delivered by inhalation of tobacco smoke or systemic infusion, intrathecally, and by intracranial microinjection in the pedunculopontine tegmentum, ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, and rostral ventromedial medulla. The antinociception is thought to be mediated by descending inhibition of spinal nociceptive transmission. Menthol cross-desensitizes nicotine-evoked oral irritation, reducing harshness that may account for its popularity as a flavor additive to tobacco products. IMPLICATIONS: Nicotine activates brain systems underlying reward and antinociception, but at the same time elicits aversive sensory effects including oral irritation and pain, bitter taste, and other unpleasant side effects mediated largely by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This review discusses the competing aversive and antinociceptive effects of nicotine and exposure to tobacco smoke, and the underlying neurobiology. An improved understanding of the interacting effects of nicotine will hopefully inform novel approaches to mitigate nicotine and tobacco use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, little is known about the types of flavored products on the market, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We describe the nature and extent of flavored cigarettes sold in nine low- and middle-income countries from four of the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions. AIMS AND METHODS: We employed a systematic protocol to purchase unique cigarette packs in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Russia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Packs were double coded for flavor descriptors and imagery using a standard codebook. Frequencies and crosstabs were conducted to examine the proportion of packs with flavor descriptors and/or flavor imagery, and flavor capsules, by country and by major manufacturer. RESULTS: Overall, 15.4% of the country-unique cigarette packs had flavor descriptors and/or imagery, representing a variety of flavors: menthol or mint (8.2%), ""concept"" descriptors (3.5%) (eg, Fusion blast), fruit or citrus (3.3%), beverages (1.4%), and others (1.4%). Flavor was mostly communicated using descriptors (15.2%), with flavor imagery being less common (2.2%). Flavor capsules were prevalent (6.2%), with almost half having ""concept"" descriptors. All major tobacco companies produced cigarettes with flavors, and with capsules. CONCLUSIONS: A range of flavored cigarettes remain on the market in the low- and middle-income countries with the greatest number of smokers. This finding is particularly concerning given the appeal of flavored cigarettes among youth and their potential to circumvent country bans on flavored tobacco products if those laws are not sufficiently comprehensive. Laws addressing flavored tobacco products need to account for flavor capsules and concept descriptors. IMPLICATIONS: While a number of countries have restricted flavors in tobacco products to reduce their appeal and attractiveness, a range of flavors continue to be on the market in low- and middle-income countries, putting people in these countries at increased risk for tobacco use and subsequent tobacco-caused death and disease. The presence of capsules and concept descriptors is particularly concerning given their appeal among youth and their potential to circumvent country bans on flavored tobacco products if those laws are not sufficiently comprehensive.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The following review provides considerations for TUD within the context of novel products. Historically, the tobacco industry falsely claimed that cigarettes were not addictive or harmful and that those who smoked simply chose to do so. This generated an inaccurate lay perception that smoking is a free or informed choice. Research on nicotine pharmacology demonstrates the powerful addictive potential of nicotine, which is shaped by dose, speed of delivery, and other constituents generated. In addition, non-pharmacologic reinforcers motivate and maintain tobacco use behaviors for both traditional cigarettes and novel products. The negative consequences of combustible tobacco use are well known; however, these outcomes may differ for alternative products. Strategies used for combustible product cessation may be adapted for novel products, and treatment recommendations for TUD should be made within the context of a harm reduction framework wherein alternative product use may be the desired outcome. Providers must therefore be willing to modify their perceptions of products and treatment recommendations accordingly. Better public health outcomes are accomplished through promotion of abstinence from combustible smoking. For those who cannot wean from nicotine entirely, switching to less risky modes of delivery might be a secondary goal, with an eventual aim of stopping use of the alternative product. Implications: Given the advent of novel, alternative tobacco products, tobacco use disorder (TUD) must be conceptualized within a contemporary framework that includes harm reduction and alternative outcomes. The unique contributions of nicotine pharmacology, non-pharmacologic reinforcers, and consequences of use can be used to inform treatments for TUD with the ultimate goal of improving the health of individuals who use tobacco.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Inadequate progress has stimulated discussion of innovative measures to reduce prevalence; because few studies have explored how marginalized groups perceive these measures, we addressed this knowledge gap. AIMS AND METHODS: In November and December 2020, we conducted 20 in-depth interviews with people who smoked daily, were aged between 21 and 53, earned less than the median income (NZD33 900), and had marginal or inadequate income sufficiency. We explored participants' smoking history and used an elicitation exercise to probe their views on smokefree policies, including potential endgame measures. We used qualitative descriptive analysis and reflexive thematic analysis to interpret the data. RESULTS: Participants favored increasing personal support to quit and reducing nicotine levels in cigarettes, but generally opposed tobacco excise tax increases and paying people to quit. While many privileged their right to ""choose,"" some recognized that stronger policies could restore the loss of agency addiction caused. Participants felt smoking's powerful addictiveness remained poorly understood, and called for smoking to be recognized and treated as an addiction. CONCLUSIONS: Several participants supported intensifying existing measures or introducing new measures. However, their use of tobacco industry rhetoric to frame smoking as a choice they had made could inadvertently reinforce the stigma they experienced. Reframing cigarettes as an addictive product engineered by a deceptive industry, may make it easier for participants to access the expanded support and compassion they sought. IMPLICATIONS: Policy measures, such as reducing the nicotine level in cigarettes, could support endgame goals; however, greater public understanding of addiction is needed to reduce stigma, support self-efficacy, and foster smoking cessation. Industry denormalization campaigns could challenge views of smoking as a personal choice, decrease self-blame among people who smoke, and present endgame goals as likely to enhance agency.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends including this information as part of modified risk tobacco product applications. Regulators, including FDA, and many public health officials and researchers consider abuse liability assessment a model which predicts the likelihood that the use of the tobacco product would result in addiction and be used repeatedly or even sporadically resulting in undesirable effects. Abuse liability of a new, potentially reduced harm product can also inform its ability to substitute completely for more harmful tobacco products. While many methods exist, no standard tobacco product abuse liability assessment has been established. The purpose of this review is to provide background information and practical recommendations for human abuse liability testing methods to meet tobacco regulatory needs. A combination of nicotine test product pharmacokinetic, subjective effect and/or behavioral response, and physiological response data relative to comparator products with known abuse liability satisfies some regulatory requirements. Implications: This review provides a practical inspection of the current, international regulatory recommendations for abuse liability assessment of tobacco and regulatory review of such information within the United States and also recommends study designs and methods for abuse liability testing of tobacco products based on scientific and regulatory knowledge. Given that tobacco product abuse liability testing is of increasing interest to regulatory bodies globally, especially with the emergence of novel tobacco products, this timely work provides background and functional recommendations for tobacco product abuse liability testing.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Altria'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

While previous research has reported cheaper cigarette prices in pharmacies, compared to other retailers, little is known about cigarette promotions in pharmacies, which are associated with increased youth smoking and unplanned cigarette purchases among adults. AIMS AND METHODS: Between May and August 2015, trained data collectors conducted store audits at 2128 tobacco retailers located within 97 U.S. counties in 40 states. Observations were made for three types of cigarette promotions: special price (e.g., $0.30 off/pack), multi-pack promotions (e.g., buy one pack, get one free), and cross-product promotions (e.g., buy a pack of cigarettes and a get free can of snus). We calculated weighted estimates of the proportion of pharmacies and other retailer types with cigarette promotions and used weighted multivariable logistic regression to compare cigarette promotions by tobacco retailer type, accounting for clustering at the county level and controlling for county-level demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Cigarette promotions were observed in 94.0% of pharmacies, more than any other retailer type (e.g., convenience stores: 82.0%, tobacco stores: 77.0%). All retailer types had lower odds of promotions for Marlboro, Newport, Camel, menthol, or any interior cigarette promotion, compared to pharmacies. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all pharmacies offered in-store cigarette promotions and pharmacies had greater odds of offering cigarette promotions than all other retailer types. Whether voluntarily or legislatively, tobacco-free pharmacies would eliminate a prevalent retail source of cigarette promotions. IMPLICATIONS: This is the first known national study to examine prevalence of cigarette promotions in U.S. pharmacies compared to other retailer types. Nearly all pharmacies offered in-store cigarette promotions and pharmacies had greater odds of offering cigarette promotions than all other retailer types. These findings underscore the inherent contradiction of pharmacies serving both as an important component of the health care system, but also as purveyors and promotors of addictive and lethal tobacco products. Whether voluntarily or legislatively, tobacco-free pharmacy policies would eliminate a prevalent retail source of cigarette promotions.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, their motives and ambitions are unclear. This study explored how popular TI vaping products are and who uses them, and how they differ from independent products. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from a longitudinal web-based survey of smokers, ex-smokers, and vapers (n = 3883) in the UK in 2019. The main study sample consisted of daily and nondaily vapers, who were current or ex-cigarette smokers, and had stated the brand of their preferred e-cigarette device (n = 1202). Proportions using TI and independent brands were calculated and regression analysis assessed associations with sociodemographic and smoking/vaping characteristics between vapers of TI and independent products. Chi-square tests were used to analyze differences between TI and independent products. RESULTS: Overall, 53.4% used TI products. A university education (67.6%; adjOR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.140-2.088), nondaily vaping (68.2%; adjOR = 1.39; CI, 1.029-1.880), and cigarette dependence (moderate, strong and very strong urges to smoke) were associated with using TI vaping brands. TI products used were less likely to be refillable (""open"") than independent brands (60.9% vs. 18.3%, chi-square = 228.98, p < .001), more likely to use nicotine salts (16.7% vs. 8.6%, chi-square = 25.04, p < .001) and tobacco flavors (23.8% vs. 17.9%, chi-square = 12.65, p < .001). CONCLUSION: TI vaping products were popular in the UK, associations with product and user characteristics suggest that TI products may be less conducive to smoking cessation, although the findings were not always consistent. IMPLICATIONS: Consequences of regulations need to be carefully considered to ensure that independent producers are not more negatively impacted than tobacco industry producers, and to avoid reducing utility of products for smoking cessation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Insights From US News Coverage Between 2012 and 2020.,"INTRODUCTION: Existing research on media examining the news content related to Tobacco 21 (T21) predate the adoption of most T21 laws. This study examined the discussion of T21 laws in top-circulating print media sources in the United States between 2012 and 2020. AIMS AND METHODS: Systematic database searches using Access World News and Factiva identified T21-related news articles appearing in the top daily circulating newspapers in each state between January 2012 and December 2020 (n = 586 articles). Content analyses documented prevalence, types of articles and context related to framing of arguments for or against T21 laws. RESULTS: Newspaper coverage of T21 was highest in 2019 (42.8% of articles). The majority were news or features (75.4%) followed by editorials or opinions (24.6%) which largely supported T21. Most articles focused on state or local T21 action. Coverage of federal T21 increased in 2019. The most common argument supporting T21 included reducing youth tobacco prevalence (64.8%) while the most frequent objection was freedom infringement (25.1%). Tobacco and vape industries began voicing support for T21 in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: News coverage of state-level T21 in the United States began to increase in 2015 and peaked in 2019 with enactment of federal T21, a newsworthy event. As states adopt and amend T21 laws to align with federal law, advocates can use media to help shape the narrative and encourage strong T21 policies. IMPLICATIONS: This study described the volume and content of T21 print media coverage from 2012 to 2020, including common arguments used to support and oppose T21. Arguments in support of T21 included reducing youth tobacco use, particularly use of e-cigarettes, and related health effects while arguments against T21 focused on individual rights. Support for T21 reached a tipping point in 2019, including the tobacco industry's reversal in opposing such laws. States can and should continue to improve existing T21 laws and policies and increase public awareness about critical policy components such as inspection procedures and penalties.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Innovation and choice are likely to improve the prospects of smokers making the switch, but this provides challenges to regulators and manufacturers to ensure that changes to regulations and products promote and do not hinder contributions to tobacco harm reduction. AIMS AND METHODS: This paper looks at where bridging data sets for tobacco heating products, closed system vaping products, and oral nicotine products might enable innovation while protecting the interests of consumers. RESULTS: We review product data from chemical studies and a toxicological study showing how bridging can be applied and consider what product development changes might allow bridging from existing datasets or trigger the need for new ones. CONCLUSIONS: Bridging across specific product ranges can increase the speed of innovation, foster competition, and limit the burden of assessment for regulators while maintaining product safety and quality. IMPLICATIONS: Bridging partial data sets is an established practice within other industries, that aims to improve efficiency with regulatory approvals, accepts natural product variation, and supports product innovation. We review product data from chemical studies and a toxicological study showing how bridging can be applied and consider what product development changes might allow bridging from existing datasets or trigger the need for new ones. This in turn can increase the speed of innovation, foster competition, and limit the burden of assessment for regulators while maintaining product safety and quality.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['British American Tobacco'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

E-cigarettes with higher abuse potential and appeal might facilitate complete switching. E-liquid nicotine concentration and flavor are two of the characteristics that may affect the abuse potential and appeal of e-cigarettes. The objective of this systematic review was to compile results from survey, animal, human laboratory, and clinical studies to understand the possible effects of nicotine concentration and flavor on abuse potential and appeal of e-cigarettes in adult current and former cigarette and e-cigarette users. AIMS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Ovid Medline and PsycINFO followed by citation tracking in Web of Science Core Collection. Peer-reviewed studies published in English between 2007 and August 2020 were selected that analyzed differences between e-liquid nicotine concentration and/or flavors, had outcome measures related to abuse potential and/or appeal, and included adult humans (18+) or animals. A total of 1624 studies were identified and screened. A qualitative synthesis of results was performed. RESULTS: Results from 104 studies included in this review suggest that higher nicotine concentration and access to a variety of flavors are likely to be associated with higher abuse potential and appeal of e-cigarettes for adult current and former cigarette and e-cigarette users. CONCLUSIONS: Higher nicotine concentrations and the availability of a variety of flavors in e-cigarettes might facilitate complete substitution for cigarettes. Future e-cigarette regulations should take into account their impact on smokers, for whom e-cigarettes may be a cessation tool or reduced-harm alternative. IMPLICATIONS: E-cigarettes may provide a reduced-harm alternative to cigarettes for smokers unwilling/unable to quit or serve as a path for quitting all nicotine products. Higher nicotine concentrations and flavor variety are associated with higher abuse potential and appeal of e-cigarettes. Higher abuse potential and appeal products may help facilitate complete switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes. Regulation of nicotine concentration and flavors aimed at decreasing naïve uptake may inadvertently decrease uptake and complete switching among smokers, reducing the harm reduction potential of e-cigarettes. Evidence-based effects of regulating nicotine concentration and flavors must be considered for the population as a whole, including smokers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

We examine the prevalence of price incentives and ad characteristics used in tobacco product advertisements (ads) mailed directly to US consumers. AIMS AND METHODS: We analyzed the content of direct-mail tobacco ads (N = 1047) in circulation between January 2018 and December 2020 as captured by Mintel Comperemedia Direct. These ads were coded for product type, manufacturer/brand type, model characteristics, price incentives, and themes known to appeal to vulnerable subgroups. RESULTS: Ads across all tobacco products included price incentives (96%) and contained themes that appealed to rural white (40%) and black audiences (15%). Themes known to appeal to youth and young adults were present in 40% of ads across all products, including 78% of ads promoting electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Moreover, the ENDS ads featuring youth appealing themes (51%), also featured young models. DISCUSSION: Expanding on previous research which focused on combustible and smokeless tobacco products, this analysis examines direct-mail ads across the full range of tobacco products. Our findings highlight the need for regulations to address (1) the high prevalence of price incentives that undermine the effectiveness of excise taxes on tobacco use, and (2) ad themes and characteristics that appeal to groups vulnerable to tobacco use, both of which have the potential to further exacerbate tobacco-related health disparities. IMPLICATIONS: This study reinforces the importance of examining direct-mail as the dominant medium for tobacco advertising, particularly by including coupons and discount codes that reduce product price and thus circumventing the effect of tobacco-related tax legislation. Direct-mail encourages continued product loyalty and use and engages new consumers using price incentives and advertising strategies likely to appeal to price-sensitive consumers and other vulnerable populations. Substantial use of youth-appealing elements in ENDS ads contradicts the tobacco industry's mandate to not appeal to youth, warranting highlighting the gaps in current regulations that allows them to continue appealing to this population.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

To date, limited data exist on the presence of warning statements in ENDS advertising. METHODS: We acquired ENDS ads (n = 459) that first ran six months before (February 10, 2018-August 9, 2018) and after (August 10, 2018-February 9, 2019) the effective date. The sample included online, print, and outdoor static ads (ie, without video or animated graphics) (n = 166 before, n = 198 after), online and television video ads (n = 16 before, n = 49 after), and radio ads (n = 9 before, n = 21 after). We coded ads for the presence of the verbatim FDA warning. Ads with verbatim warnings were coded for required formatting and additional features. RESULTS: Overall, 28% of static (n = 46/166), 62% of video (n = 10/16), and 67% of radio (n = 6/9) ads that ran before the effective date contained the verbatim warning versus 84% (n = 167/198, p &lt; .001), 96% (n = 47/49, p = .002), and 86% (n = 18/21, p =.329) of ads that ran after, respectively. Following the effective date, nearly all static ads placed the warning as required at the top of the ad (76% [n = 35/46] before, 97% [n = 162/167] after, p &lt; .001), and many video ads featured the warning statement for the entire ad duration (0% [n = 0/10] before, 60% [n = 28/47] after, p &lt; .001). Half (n = 9/18) of radio warnings running after the effective date were read faster than the other promotional content. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the nicotine warning statement on paid promotional static, video, and radio ENDS ads in this sample increased after August 10, 2018, but a notable number still lacked the warning. IMPLICATIONS: Results from this study provide initial insights into the extent to which required nicotine warning statements appear in ENDS ads in the study sample across traditional (eg, magazines, television, radio) and digital (eg, online/mobile ads) advertising mediums. Following the August 10, 2018, effective date, we observed a substantial increase in the presence of the required FDA warning statement on the ENDS ads in this sample. However, a notable number of ads in the study lacked the required warning and warnings did not always include the required formatting displays.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In response, JUUL discontinued sweet flavors in late 2018, followed by mint flavors in November 2019. We assessed ENDS sales and prices at both the state and national level before and after JUUL's removal of mint flavors. AIMS AND METHODS: Nielsen retail sales data on ENDS products from convenience and food stores in 4-week aggregates were analyzed between January 2019 and January 2020 in Florida and the United States. Standardized units were created. Unit market share and growth rates were calculated for top brands and flavors in the periods before and after JUUL's mint removal. Average prices within brand and product type were calculated. RESULTS: Following JUUL's removal of mint in November 2019, JUUL's market share dropped from over 66% in Florida and the United States to 37.1% (Florida) and 55.1% (United States). In January 2020, the second leading brands were Puff Bar (15.0%) in Florida and Vuse (18.1%) in the United States. Mint market share decreased and share of all other flavor categories increased, particularly menthol and concept. Total ENDS sales increased in Florida but decreased in the United States. Average prices of ENDS devices decreased. CONCLUSIONS: While JUUL's actions led to a decline in its sales, Puff Bar emerged and menthol and concept flavors experienced growth. Findings also demonstrate how changes by influential brands differentially affect purchase patterns at the national and state level. IMPLICATIONS: These findings support the growing body of evidence that tobacco industry self-regulation, with selective flavor removal by the leading ENDS brand in this case, is insufficient to reduce total ENDS sales, including sales of flavored products which are preferred by youth. Results suggest that brand and flavor substitution compensated for the removal of mint JUUL pods. Understanding changes to the ENDS market in response to industry actions, at both the state and national level, can inform future regulation and interventions. These findings can also inform efforts to prevent and reduce youth ENDS use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study evaluated cigarette, e-cigarette, and total nicotine dependence more than 6 months among smokers reducing cigarette consumption by replacing with e-cigarettes. AIMS AND METHODS: Adult cigarette smokers were randomized to one of four conditions (36 mg/ml e-cigarette, 8 mg/ml e-cigarette, 0 mg/ml e-cigarette, or cigarette-substitute [CS] [provided at no cost]) and instructed to reduce their cigarette smoking by 75% at 1 month. Participants completed follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months. The Penn State Nicotine Dependence Index (PSNDI) measured dependence on cigarettes (PSCDI) and e-cigarettes (PSECDI). Urine cotinine measured total nicotine exposure. Linear mixed effects models for each outcome were conducted and included interaction terms between visit and condition. RESULTS: Participants (n = 520) were 58.8% female, 67.3% White, and 48.0 years old. At baseline, the median number of cigarettes smoked per day was 17.3 and the mean PSCDI score was 13.4, with no significant differences between conditions. Participants in the e-cigarette conditions reported significantly lower PSCDI scores, compared with baseline, and with the CS condition at all follow-up visits. Those in the 36 mg/ml e-cigarette condition reported greater PSECDI scores at 6 months, compared with baseline and the 0 mg/ml and 8 mg/ml conditions. At all follow-up visits, there were no differences in total nicotine exposure compared to baseline, nor between any conditions. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette use was associated with reduced cigarette dependence, compared to the CS, without significant increases in total nicotine exposure. IMPLICATIONS: Initiation of electronic cigarette use while continuing to smoke could potentially increase nicotine dependence. In this randomized trial aimed at helping smokers to reduce their cigarette intake, we found that use of an e-cigarette was associated with a reduction in cigarette dependence and an increase in e-cigarette dependence (in the condition with the highest nicotine concentration only), with no long term increase in total nicotine dependence or nicotine exposure.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Research suggests decreasing nicotine levels (i.e. very low nicotine content cigarettes [VLNCs]) produced greater quit attempts, reduced smoking, and reduced exposure to harmful constituents among smokers. The impact of long-term VLNC use among people who co-use cigarettes and cannabis on non-tobacco-specific toxicant and carcinogen exposure has not been investigated. AIMS AND METHODS: This study presents secondary analyses of a controlled clinical trial examining switching to VLNC (versus a normal nicotine cigarettes control group [NNCs]) between people who co-use cigarettes and cannabis (n = 174) versus smoked cigarettes (n = 555). Linear mixed-effects models compared changes in smoking behavior, and tobacco-specific (i.e. total nicotine equivalents [TNE], 4-[methylnitrosamino]-1-[3-pyridyl]-1-butanone [NNK; total NNAL]) and non-tobacco-specific (i.e. carbon monoxide (CO), 2-cyanoethylmercapturic acid [CEMA], phenanthrene tetraol [PheT]) toxicant and carcinogen exposure at week 20 (with random intercept for participants). Cannabis use was measured among co-use groups. RESULTS: CO was significantly lower only among the cigarette-only group assigned VLNCs (interaction: p = .015). Although both VLNC groups demonstrated decreased CEMA, greater decreases emerged among the cigarette-only group (interaction: p = .016). No significant interactions emerged for TNE, cigarettes per day (CPD), NNAL, and PheT (ps > .05); both VLNC groups decreased in TNE, CPD, and NNAL. Only the cigarette-only group assigned VLNCs demonstrated decreased PheT (p < .001). The VLNC co-use group showed increased cannabis use over time (p = .012; 0.5 more days per week by week 20). CONCLUSIONS: Those who co-use cannabis and cigarettes may still be at risk for greater exposure to non-tobacco-specific toxicants and carcinogens compared to those who only smoke cigarettes. IMPLICATIONS: The present study is the longest longitudinal, prospective comparison study of smoking behavior and exposure to harmful constituents among those who co-use cigarettes and cannabis versus cigarette-only after immediately switching to very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNC). Those who co-use experienced similar reductions in CPD and tobacco-specific exposure, compared to those who only use cigarettes. However, co-use groups experienced smaller reductions in non-tobacco-specific toxicants and carcinogens compared to the cigarette-only group, potentially because of combustible cannabis use. Additionally, those who co-use and switched to VLNC may be susceptible to slight increases in cannabis use (approximately two more days per year).","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Industry funding is contentious as it influences study outcomes, and is not always disclosed in scientific publications. This study examines the role of disclosed and undisclosed industry support on THR publications via social network analysis. METHODS: We reviewed 826 English-language manuscripts (1992-2016) to determine disclosed and undisclosed industry (pharmaceutical, tobacco, and e-cigarette) and non-industry (including government) support received by 1405 authors. We used social network analysis to identify the most influential authors in THR discourse by assessing the number of their collaborators on publications, the frequency of connecting other authors in the network, and tendency to form groups based on the presence of sponsorship disclosures, sources of funding, and THR stance. RESULTS: About 284 (20%) out of 1405 authors were supported by industry. Industry-sponsored authors were more central and influential in the network: with twice as many publications (Median = 4), 1.25 as many collaborators on publications (Median = 5), and higher likelihood of connecting other authors and thus having more influence in the network, compared to non-industry-sponsored authors. E-cigarette industry-sponsored authors had the strongest association with undisclosed industry support. CONCLUSIONS: Authors with industry support exerted a stronger influence on the THR scientific discourse than non-industry-supported authors. Journals should continue adhering to strict policies requiring conflicts of interest disclosures. An increase in public health spending on tobacco control research may be necessary to achieve funding parity.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Few studies, however, have examined the longitudinal association between coupon receipt and smoking cessation. AIMS AND METHODS: Using adult data from waves 1-5 (2013-2019) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, we examined the longitudinal association between coupon receipt and short-term smoking cessation. Multivariable discrete-time survival models were fit to an unbalanced person-period dataset for adult respondents (≥18 years) with current established smoking status at baseline (person n = 9472, risk period n = 29 784). Short-term smoking cessation was measured as discontinued cigarette use (no past 30-day cigarette use at follow-up) and self-reported complete quitting. Coupon receipt was measured as a time-varying exposure, measured in the wave preceding the outcome. Tobacco dependence and time-varying cigarette use intensity were controlled as potential confounders. Effect modification by age, sex, race-ethnicity, and education was assessed by examining interaction terms. RESULTS: We found that adults who received a coupon were 19% less likely to quit smoking compared to adults who did not receive a coupon, adjusting for covariates (adjusted hazard rate [aHR]: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.74-0.89). None of the interaction terms were statistically significant, suggesting that the association between coupon receipt and short-term smoking cessation may not differ across the sociodemographic groups that we examined. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results reveal that coupon receipt reduces the likelihood of short-term smoking cessation, and that this association does not differ by age, sex, race-ethnicity, or education. IMPLICATIONS (97/100): Tobacco companies distribute coupons for tobacco products to price-sensitive customers in the United States, and these coupons can be particularly effective in partly offsetting the impact of a tax increases and promoting brand loyalty. This study provides longitudinal evidence that coupon receipt is associated with a decrease in short-term smoking cessation among US adults who smoke cigarettes after adjusting for covariates and tobacco-related confounders. The findings from this study suggest that coupons are an effective tool for tobacco companies to prevent adults who smoke from quitting, and a national ban on coupons may help to facilitate smoking cessation.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Between 2015 and 2018, HMPPS introduced a complete smoke-free policy in all closed prisons, and a partial policy permitting smoking only in smoking shelters in open prisons. AIMS AND METHODS: This study aimed to explore the views of stakeholders regarding the implementation and continuation of smoke-free policies, including the management of nicotine addiction during imprisonment and after release. Individuals with key strategic and/or operational roles in delivering smoke-free prison policies across England were purposively sampled to complete a semi-structured interview. Twenty-eight interviews were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: The smoke-free implementation across the closed prison estate was viewed as a success, though there were reports of reduced availability of smoking cessation support since the roll out. Participants thought the majority of tobacco smokers living in closed prison environments were now using an electronic cigarette, typically as a temporary means to manage nicotine addiction until release. In open prisons the partial policy has been less successful; high rates of smoking resumption on moving from closed to open conditions were reported, with many participants arguing that the open estate should also go completely smoke free. It was envisaged that most prisoners would resume smoking on community release. CONCLUSIONS: The smoke-free policies provide a unique opportunity to promote lifelong cessation in this highly disadvantaged group. However more could be done to adopt a consistent smoke-free policy across all prisons, and to support prisoners in quitting smoking and nicotine use during and after imprisonment. IMPLICATIONS: Our results identify the urgent need for more work to explore rates and reasons for relapse to smoking on transfer to the open estate and after release. With the majority of smokers in the closed prison estate now using e-cigarettes to manage their nicotine addiction, one way to support long-term tobacco abstinence could be to place greater emphasis on this switching behavior as a way of reducing tobacco-related harm within this population.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

We consider market competition as a primary driver of whether cigarette companies follow through on their stated intentions. AIMS AND METHODS: We focus on the behavior of cigarette companies in the United States. We compare competition in the pre- and post-2012 time periods, analyze the impact of the growth in NVPs on smoking prevalence and cigarette company profits, and examine the potential future role of competition. RESULTS: Since 2006, consumers have broadened their use of non-combustible nicotine delivery products (NCNDPs) to include, inter alia, NVPs, HTPs, and oral nicotine pouches. U.S. cigarette companies have acquired major stakes in each of these product categories which corresponds to a period of rapidly declining adult smoking prevalence, especially among younger adults (ages 18-24 years). The shifting dynamics of the nicotine product marketplace are also reflected in cigarette company stock prices. While cigarette companies are likely to promote HTPs and nicotine delivery products over NVPs, their incentives will be directly related to competition from independent firms, which in turn will depend on government regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Although cigarette companies will back alternatives to combusted tobacco when threatened by competition, the prospects for their lasting conversion to NCNDPs will depend on the extent of such competition, which will be influenced by government regulation of tobacco products. IMPLICATIONS: Regulations that limit competition from independent firms while also protecting cigarette company profits risk slowing or even reversing recent declines in smoking, especially among youth and young adults. Regulations that reduce the appeal and addictiveness of combusted tobacco products, such as higher cigarette taxes or a reduced nicotine standard, will encourage smokers to quit and/or switch to less harmful non-combusted forms of tobacco. The regulation of non-combustible nicotine delivery products and cigarettes should be proportionate to their relative risks, so that smokers have incentives to switch from combustibles to safer alternatives, and cigarette companies have incentives to promote safer products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study assessed trends in nicotine strength in e-cigarettes sold in the United States during January 2017-March 2022. AIMS AND METHODS: We obtained January 2017-March 2022 national retail e-cigarette sales data from NielsenIQ. We assessed monthly average nicotine strength overall, by e-cigarette product and flavor type, and manufacturer. A Joinpoint regression model assessed the magnitude and significance of changes in nicotine strength. RESULTS: During January 2017-March 2022, monthly average nicotine strength of e-cigarette products increased from 2.5% to 4.4%, an average of 0.8% per month (p < .001). Monthly average nicotine strength of disposable e-cigarettes increased the most (average monthly percentage change [AMPC] = 1.26%, p < .001) as compared to prefilled pods (AMPC = 0.6%, p < .001) and e-liquids (AMPC = 0.5%, p = .218). Monthly average nicotine strength for all flavors of e-cigarette products increased except for mint-flavored products. Increases were greatest for beverage-flavored products (AMPC = 2.1%, p < .001), followed by menthol-flavored products (AMPC = 1.2%, p < .001). Among the top 10 e-cigarette manufacturers assessed, monthly average nicotine strength decreased for Juul Labs products from 5% to 4.7% (AMPC = -0.1%, p < .001) but increased significantly for five manufacturers' products and remained unchanged at 5%-6% for four manufacturers' products. CONCLUSIONS: Monthly average nicotine strength of e-cigarette products increased overall, for most product and flavor types, and for some manufacturers in the United States during the study period. Imposing maximum limits on nicotine strength of e-cigarettes together with other evidence-based tobacco control strategies can help reduce the use of e-cigarettes among youth and increase tobacco product cessation among adults. IMPLICATIONS: From January 2017 to March 2022, the monthly average nicotine strength of disposable e-cigarettes increased substantially and exceeded prefilled pods since May 2020. E-cigarettes with menthol flavor and youth-appealing flavors, like fruit, also had sharp increases in monthly average nicotine strength. Among the top 10 e-cigarette manufacturers, monthly average nicotine strength increased or remained unchanged at a high nicotine level for all manufacturers' products, except Juul Lab's products. Comprehensive strategies including restricting sales of all flavored e-cigarettes, restricting youth tobacco product access, and imposing maximum limits on nicotine strength may help reduce youth e-cigarette use and increase tobacco cessation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

AIMS AND METHODS: In 2019-2020, people who use pod-mods in the San Francisco Bay Area completed questionnaires and provided a urine sample for analysis of total nicotine equivalents (TNE). The relationship between TNE and e-cigarette use, e-cigarette brands, e-liquid nicotine strength, e-cigarette dependence, and urine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), as a measure of combustible cigarette exposure, were examined. RESULTS: Of 100 participants (64% male, 71% in the 18-34 age group, 45% white), 53 used JUUL primarily, 12 used Puff Bar primarily, and 35 used other brands, including Suorin; 48 participants reported current cigarette smoking. Participants most often reported use of e-liquid with 4.5%-6.0% nicotine (68%), fruit (35%), tobacco (28%), and menthol or mint flavors (26%), used e-cigarettes on 25.5 (SD = 6.3) days a month, 10.2 (SD = 14.2) times a day, and 40% used 1-2 pods/cartridges per week. In bivariate analysis, urinary TNE was higher with greater frequency (days used) and intensity (number of pods used) of e-cigarette use, e-cigarette dependence, and combustible cigarette use. In multivariable analysis, days of e-cigarette use in the last 30 days, number of pods used per week, and NNAL levels were significantly associated with TNE. There was no significant impact of e-liquid nicotine strength on TNE. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine intake among people who used pod-mod e-cigarettes increased with e-cigarette consumption and e-cigarette dependence, but not with e-liquid nicotine strength. Our findings may inform whether FDA adopts a nicotine standard for e-cigarettes. IMPLICATIONS: The study examined how device and user characteristics influence nicotine intake among pod-mod e-cigarette users. Nicotine intake increased with frequency (days of e-cigarette use in past 30 days) intensity of use (number of pods used per day) and e-cigarette dependence but not with the flavor or nicotine concentration of the e-liquids. Regulation of nicotine concentration of e-liquids is unlikely to influence nicotine exposure among adult experienced pod-mod users.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Research on the substitutability of e-cigarettes and HTPs is crucial for understanding their impact on public health. This study examined subjective and behavioral preferences for an e-cigarette and HTP relative to participants' usual brand combustible cigarette (UBC) in African American and White smokers naïve to alternative products. AIMS AND METHODS: Twenty-two adult African American (n = 12) and White (n = 10) smokers completed randomized study sessions with their UBC and study provided e-cigarette and HTP. A concurrent choice task allowed participants to earn puffs of the products but placed UBC on a progressive ratio schedule, making puffs harder to earn, and e-cigarette and HTP on a fixed ratio schedule to assess behavioral preference for the products. Behavioral preference was then compared to self-reported subjective preference. RESULTS: Most participants had a subjective preference for UBC (n = 11, 52.4%), followed by an equal preference for e-cigarette (n = 5, 23.8%) and HTP (n = 5, 23.8%). During the concurrent choice task, participants showed a behavioral preference (i.e., more earned puffs) for the e-cigarette (n = 9, 42.9%), followed by HTP (n = 8, 38.1%), and UBC (n = 4, 19.1%). Participants earned significantly more puffs of the alternative products compared to UBC (p = .011) with no difference in earned puffs between e-cigarettes and HTP (p = .806). CONCLUSIONS: In a simulated lab setting, African American and White smokers were willing to substitute UBC for an e-cigarette or HTP when the attainment of UBC became more difficult. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04646668. IMPLICATIONS: Findings suggest that African American and White smokers are willing to substitute their UBC for an alternative nicotine delivery product (e-cigarette or HTP) when the attainment of cigarettes became more difficult in a simulated lab setting. Findings require confirmation among a larger sample under real-world conditions but add to growing evidence suggesting the acceptability of alternative nicotine delivery products among racially diverse smokers. These data are important as policies that limit the availability or appeal of combustible cigarettes are considered or enacted.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Flavored restrictions claim to promote equity; however, no previous studies have compared the effect of cigarette and e-cigarette flavor restrictions among individuals who smoke with lower and higher socioeconomic status (SES). AIMS AND METHODS: In a between-group within-subject design, individuals with lower (n = 155) and higher (n = 125) SES completed hypothetical purchasing trials in the experimental tobacco marketplace (ETM). Conditions were presented in a 2 × 2 factorial design (cigarette flavors restricted or unrestricted and e-cigarette flavors restricted or unrestricted) with increasing cigarette prices across trials. RESULTS: Results show (1) SES differences in cigarette, e-cigarette, and NRT purchases under unrestricted policies, with lower SES showing higher cigarette demand and lower e-cigarette and NRT substitution than higher SES, (2) cigarette restrictions decreased cigarette and increased NRT purchases among lower SES, but no significant changes among higher SES, (3) decreased SES differences in cigarette demand under cigarette restrictions, but persistence under e-cigarette restrictions or their combination, (4) persistence of SES differences in e-cigarette purchases when all restrictions were enforced, and (5) waning of SES differences in NRT purchasing under all restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: Flavor restrictions differentially affected individuals based on SES. Within-group comparisons demonstrated restrictions significantly impacted lower SES, but not higher SES. Between-group comparisons showed SES differences in cigarette purchasing decreased under cigarette restrictions, but persisted under e-cigarette-restrictions or their combination. Additionally, SES differences in NRT substitution decreased under flavor restrictions. These findings highlight the utility of the ETM to investigate SES disparities. IMPLICATIONS: With increasing trends of socioeconomic differences in smoking prevalence and cessation rates, smoking-related health disparities are expected to continue to widen. Restricting menthol flavor in cigarettes while enhancing the availability and affordability of NRT have the potential to alleviate SES disparities in tobacco use, therefore, positively impacting health equity. However, this effect may depend on flavor availability in other tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

CM has been found to be effective, however, individual participant, analyses are warranted to further elucidate how individual-level behavior patterns vary during the intervention period, both within and across treatment groups. AIMS AND METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled pilot trial of presurgical cancer patients who smoke (RCT N = 40). All participants were current everyday smokers and were enrolled in cessation counseling, offered nicotine replacement therapy, and submitted breath CO testing 3 times per week for 2-5 weeks. Participants randomized to CM received monetary reinforcers for breath CO ≤6 ppm on an escalating schedule of reinforcement with a reset for positive samples. Sufficient breath CO data exist for 28 participants (CM = 14; monitoring only [MO] = 14). Effect size was calculated for differences in negative CO tests. Time to first negative test was tested using survival analysis. Fisher's exact test was used to assess relapse. RESULTS: The CM group achieved abstinence more quickly (p < .05), had a lower percentage of positive tests (h = 0.80), and experienced fewer lapses following abstinence (p = .00). While 11 of 14 participants in the CM group achieved and sustained abstinence by their third breath test, this was only true for 2 of the 14 MO participants. CONCLUSIONS: Those in CM achieved abstinence quicker and with fewer lapses than those engaged in MO speaking to the efficacy of the schedule of financial reinforcement. This is particularly important within presurgical populations given the potential benefits to postoperative cardiovascular and wound infection risk. IMPLICATIONS: While the efficacy of CM as an intervention is well established, this secondary analysis provides insight into the individual behavior patterns underlying successful abstinence. Those assigned to CM were not only more likely to achieve abstinence, but did so more quickly and with fewer instances of relapse. This is of particular importance to those scheduled for surgery where achieving abstinence as early as possible impacts on the risk of postoperative complications. CM interventions may be particularly well suited for critical windows in which timely and sustained abstinence is advantageous.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

We extend this approach to develop a common, cross-product metric for TD among youth. METHODS: One thousand one hundred and forty-eight youth aged 12-17 who used a tobacco product in the past 30 days were identified from 13 651 youth respondents in Wave 1 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. FINDINGS: Analyses confirmed a single primary latent construct underlying responses to TD indicators for all mutually exclusive tobacco product user groups. Differential Item Functioning analyses supported the use of 8 of 10 TD indicators for comparisons across groups. With TD levels anchored at 0.0 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.0) among cigarette only (n = 265) use group, mean TD scores were more than a full SD lower for e-cigarette only (n = 150) use group (mean = -1.09; SD = 0.64). Other single product use group (cigar, hookah, pipe, or smokeless; n = 262) on average had lower TD (mean = -0.60; SD = 0.84), and the group with the use of multiple tobacco products (n = 471) experienced similar levels of TD (mean = 0.14; SD = 0.78) as the cigarette only use group. Concurrent validity was established with product use frequency among all user groups. A subset of five TD items comprised a common metric permitting comparisons between youth and adults. CONCLUSION: The PATH Study Youth Wave 1 Interview provided psychometrically valid measures of TD that enable future regulatory investigations of TD across tobacco products and comparisons between youth and adult tobacco product use group. IMPLICATIONS: A measure of tobacco dependence (TD) has been established previously among adults to compare TD across tobacco products. This study established the validity of a similar, cross-product measure of TD among youth. Findings suggest a single latent TD construct underlying this measure, concurrent validity of the scale with product use frequency across different types of tobacco users, and a subset of common items that can be used to compare TD between youth and adults who use tobacco.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

A Representative Population Survey in England, 2018-2022.","INTRODUCTION: In the last 5 years, there has been a dramatic shift in the types of nicotine products being purchased. This study aimed to estimate how much users spend on types of cigarettes and alternative nicotine products (e-cigarettes, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), heated tobacco, and nicotine pouches) and describe changes between 2018 and 2022. AIMS AND METHODS: Monthly representative cross-sectional survey in England. 10 323 adults who smoked cigarettes or used alternative nicotine reported their average weekly expenditure on these products, adjusted for inflation. RESULTS: Smokers spent £20.49 [95% CI = 20.09-20.91] on cigarettes each week (£27.66 [26.84-28.50] and £15.96 [15.49-16.28] among those who mainly smoked manufactured and hand-rolled cigarettes, respectively), e-cigarette users spent £6.30 [5.99-6.55] (£8.41 [7.17-9.78], £6.42 [5.58-7.39], and £5.93 [5.64-6.30] among those who mainly used disposable, pod, and refillable devices, respectively), NRT users £6.11 [5.53-6.69], and heated tobacco users £13.87 [9.58-20.09]. Expenditure on cigarettes grew by 10% from September 2018 to July 2020, then fell by 10% from July 2020 to June 2022. These changes coincided with a 13% reduction in cigarette consumption and a 14% increase in the proportion mainly smoking hand-rolled cigarettes. Expenditure on e-cigarettes was stable between 2018 and late 2020, then rose by 31% up to mid-2022. Expenditure on NRT increased slowly in 2018-2020 (+4%) and more quickly thereafter (+20%). CONCLUSIONS: Inflation-adjusted expenditure on cigarettes has fallen since 2020, such that the average smoker in England currently spends the same on cigarettes each week as in 2018. This has been achieved by smoking fewer cigarettes and switching to cheaper hand-rolled cigarettes. Expenditure on alternative nicotine has increased above inflation; users spent around a third more on these products in 2022 than between 2018-2020. IMPLICATIONS: People in England continue to spend substantially more on smoking cigarettes than using alternative nicotine products. The average smoker in England spends around £13 a week (~£670 a year) more than people using only e-cigarettes or NRT. The average expenditure on manufactured cigarettes is double that of hand-rolled cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

AIMS AND METHODS: Data analyzed came from 8642 adults (≥18 years) who smoked daily/weekly and participated in the 2020 ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey in Australia (n = 1213), Canada (n = 2633), England (n = 3057), and United States (n = 1739). Respondents were asked: ""Compared to smoking cigarettes, how harmful do you think nicotine replacement products are?"" Responses were dichotomized into ""much less"" versus otherwise for analysis using multivariable logistic regression models, complemented by decision-tree analysis to identify conjoint factors. RESULTS: Percentages believing that NRTs are much less harmful than CCs were 29.7% (95% CI = 26.2% to 33.5%) in Australia, 27.4% (95% CI = 25.1% to 29.8%) in England, 26.4% (95% CI = 24.4% to 28.4%) in Canada, and 21.7% (95% CI = 19.2% to 24.3%) in the United States. Across all countries, believing nicotine is not at all/slightly harmful to health (aOR = 1.53-2.27), endorsing nicotine vaping products (NVPs) as less harmful than CCs (much less harmful: aOR = 7.24-14.27; somewhat less harmful: aOR = 1.97-3.23), and possessing higher knowledge of smoking harms (aOR = 1.23-1.88) were individual factors associated with increased odds of believing NRTs are much less harmful than CCs. With some country variations, these nicotine-related measures also interacted with each other and sociodemographic variables to serve as conjoint factors associated with the likelihood of accurate NRT relative harm belief. CONCLUSIONS: Many people who regularly smoke cigarettes are unaware that NRTs are much less harmful than cigarettes. Additionally, beliefs about NRTs relative harmfulness appear to be influenced by both individual and conjoint factors. IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates that despite past efforts to educate people who smoke about the harms of NRTs relative to CCs, misperceptions around the relative harmfulness of NRTs remain substantial. In all four studied countries, subgroups of people who smoke regularly who are misinformed about the relative harmfulness of NRTs, and who may be reluctant to use NRTs for smoking cessation can be reliably identified for corrective interventions based on their understanding of the harms related to nicotine, NVPs and smoking along with sociodemographic markers. The identified subgroup information can be used to prioritize and inform the development of effective interventions to specifically address the gaps in knowledge and understanding of the various subgroups identified. Our results suggest these may need to be tailored for each country.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

A May 2021 court decision regarding patent infringement required IQOS' removal from the U.S. market in November 2021. AIMS AND METHODS: Using 2019-2021 Numerator marketing data, this study characterized ad occurrences and expenditures-including allocation per ad content (headline theme, imagery) and media type and channel-pre- and post-MRTPA; exploratory analyses characterized the post-court to withdrawal period separately. RESULTS: The study period entailed 685 occurrences and $15 451 870 in expenditures. The proportions of occurrences across the three periods (pre-MRTPA, post-MRTPA, and post-court) were 39.3%, 48.8%, and 12.0%, respectively (p < .001); the proportions of expenditures were 8.6%, 30.0%, and 61.5%. Overall, 73.1% of ad occurrences were via online display; 99.6% of expenditures occurred in print. Per occurrences, prominent pre-MRTPA headline themes included ""future"" (40.2%), ""real tobacco"" (38.7%), ""get IQOS"" (35.3%), and ""innovation or technology"" (20.1%); post-MRTPA, prominent themes included ""not burned or heat control"" (32.7%), ""reduced exposure"" (26.4%), and ""distinct from e-cigarettes"" (20.7%). Visuals mainly depicted the product alone (pre-MRTPA: 86.6%; post-MRTPA: 76.1%), but increasingly featured women (pre-MRTPA: 8.6%; post-MRTPA: 21.5%). The most prominent media channel theme pre-MRTPA was ""technology"" (19.7%), but post-MRTPA included ""women's fashion"" (20.4%) and ""entertainment or pop culture/gaming"" (19.0%). CONCLUSIONS: IQOS leveraged MRTPA in ads, continued marketing post-court decision, and targeted key consumer groups (ie, women). Marketing surveillance of products granted MRTPA is needed, domestically and in other countries, to assess its use and impact. IMPLICATIONS: Philip Morris (PM) leveraged IQOS' MRTPA from the U.S. FDA, and continued marketing IQOS after its withdrawal from the U.S. market due to a patent-infringement-related court decision. Notably, IQOS marketing increasingly targeted key consumer groups (eg, women). Given IQOS' potential return to the United States, PM's use of FDA's MRTPA to promote IQOS as a risk reduction product in other countries, and FDA's MRTPA for other products, it is crucial to monitor products receiving MRTPA, their marketing, and their population impact, domestically and in other countries.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

AIMS AND METHODS: Data were analyzed from the first three waves from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a nationally representative, longitudinal study of adults and youth in the United States. Data included 9556 wave 1 (2013-2014) adult current established tobacco users aged 18 or older who completed all three interviews and had established use at ≥2 assessments. Mutually exclusive groups included: users of cigarettes only, e-cigarettes only, cigars only, hookah only, any smokeless only, cigarette + e-cigarette dual users, and other multiple product users. A validated 16-item scale assessed TD across product users. RESULTS: People who used e-cigarettes exclusively at wave 1 had small increases in TD through wave 3. Wave 1 multiple product users' TD decreased across waves. TD for all other wave 1 user groups remained about the same. For wave 1 cigarette only smokers, switching to another product was associated with lower levels of TD than smokers whose use stayed the same. Movement to no established use of any tobacco product was consistently associated with lower TD for all product users. CONCLUSIONS: Except for wave 1 e-cigarette only users (who experienced small increases in TD), TD among U.S. tobacco product users was stable over time, with daily users less likely to vary from baseline. IMPLICATIONS: The level of TD among most U.S. tobacco users was stable over the first three waves of the PATH Study and trends in levels of TD were predominantly unrelated to changes in patterns of continued product use. Stable levels of TD suggest a population at persistent risk of health impacts from tobacco. Wave 1 e-cigarette users experienced small increases in levels of TD over time, perhaps due to increases in quantity or frequency of their e-cigarette use or increasing efficiency of nicotine delivery over time.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

AIMS AND METHODS: Participants were from the U.S. cohort of the main trial and randomized (1:1:1:1) to varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) patch, or placebo for 12 weeks with follow-up through week 24. Medical comorbidity data were derived from the baseline medical screening questionnaire and categorized into four subgroups (cardiac, respiratory, vascular, and diabetes). Within each comorbidity, generalized linear mixed models were used to assess the association between treatment and continuous abstinence rates from weeks 9-12 to 9-24. Similar models were used to test the effect of number of comorbidities on abstinence. RESULTS: Varenicline resulted in the highest week 12 abstinence rates across all pharmacotherapies and compared to placebo in all comorbidity subgroups: Cardiac (40.0% vs. 3.6%; odds ratios [OR] = 23.3 [5.1-107.1]), respiratory (24.7% vs. 12.8%; OR = 2.2 [1.3-3.8]), vascular (29.1% vs. 10.4%; OR = 3.6 [2.3-5.7]), and diabetes (30.9% vs. 8.3%; OR = 6.5 [2.3-19.0]). This was maintained at week 24 for those with cardiac (23.3% vs. 1.8%; OR = 21.7 [2.7-178.2]), vascular (18.9% vs. 7.1%; OR = 3.1 [1.8-5.3]), and diabetes (20.6% vs. 4.2%; OR = 8.4 [2.1-33.7]) comorbidities. Treatment contrasts within some comorbidity subgroups revealed superior efficacy of varenicline over other pharmacotherapies. All pharmacotherapies increased the odds of abstinence regardless of number of comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Varenicline is the most efficacious option for patients with manageable cardiac, respiratory, vascular, and diabetes conditions to quit smoking, supporting recent clinical practice guidelines that recommend varenicline as first-line pharmacotherapy. Bupropion and NRT demonstrated efficacy for some comorbidity subgroups. IMPLICATIONS: This secondary analysis of the EAGLES trial demonstrated that varenicline is the most efficacious option for patients with cardiac, respiratory, vascular, and diabetes diagnoses to quit smoking. This demonstration of varenicline efficacy among individuals with comorbid medical conditions supports recent clinical practice guidelines that recommend varenicline as a first-line pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

We focus on PMIs potential progress in moving from primarily selling cigarettes toward primarily selling noncombustible nicotine delivery products (NCNDPs). We also consider the potential contribution of the acquisition to industry transformation whereby other cigarette firms may potentially move toward primarily selling NCNDPs. We examine the potential impact on noncombustible nicotine delivery product use, including nicotine pouches (a major Swedish Match product), e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products, and, most importantly, on sales of the industry's staple, combustible cigarettes. We focus on the United States as a special case, where PMI is limited from entering the cigarette market. Implications: Philip Morris International's purchase of Swedish Match and policies regarding nicotine pouches (NPs) have been overlooked in the tobacco control literature. The acquisition indicates the importance of the NP market to the largest nonstate-owned tobacco company. The acquisition has the potential through pricing and marketing tactics to either encourage or discourage the use of NPs, e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products, and most importantly cigarettes. Due to its inability to sell cigarettes in the United States, PMI will have incentives to use its alternative nicotine delivery products, including its newly acquired NPs, to reduce the sale of cigarettes by other companies. However, the potential effects in other countries, where PMI does sell cigarettes, are less clear.

Policies that focus on restricting the sale of menthol cigarettes have the potential to significantly reduce the death toll from smoking while also mitigating health inequities and advancing racial equity. However, limited qualitative research exists on the perceptions of menthol cigarette sales restrictions, including local policies, among Black adults who smoke menthol cigarettes. AIMS AND METHODS: In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted between January and September 2021 with self-identified non-Hispanic Black adults who reported current menthol cigarette use (n = 26). Participants were asked open-ended questions about awareness and perceptions of the Los Angeles County law banning the retail sale of menthol cigarettes in unincorporated communities, including how it influences their smoking and purchasing behaviors. RESULTS: We used three thematic categories to structure the results: (1) Are People Aware of Local Menthol Cigarette Sales Restrictions? Levels of Awareness and Strategies to Increase Awareness, (2) Why Ban Menthol? Concerns About Equity and Fairness, and (3) Will Menthol Cigarette Bans Decrease Smoking? Mixed Perceptions About Potential Impact. Most participants (88.5%) had heard about the menthol ban in their communities. Participants described ambivalence towards the ban and identified several factors that hinder support, participation, and well-being, including uncertainty regarding the rationale for banning menthol cigarettes; perceptions that the ban specifically targets Black communities; and concerns regarding government overreach and constraining individual choice. Participants had differing views on whether the ban would likely help them and others who smoke menthol cigarettes reduce or quit smoking. Participants also described situations in which they would purchase menthol cigarettes in another state, country, online, or in the illicit market. Furthermore, participants often viewed the ban as perpetuating criminalization and over-policing of Black communities-arguments used by the commercial tobacco industry to oppose menthol bans. CONCLUSIONS: Our community-based sample of Black adults who smoke menthol cigarettes face challenges and concerns about local menthol bans. Community-centered interventions, messages, and materials about racial equity in menthol bans, access to free cessation services, and countering commercial tobacco industry interference, in addition to measurable steps toward rectifying injustice from the commercial tobacco industry and repeated exemptions of menthol cigarettes from federal legislation through tangible reparations, would be helpful to this community. IMPLICATIONS: We sought to add to the literature on flavored nicotine and commercial tobacco policies in the United States by centering the voices of Black adults who smoke menthol cigarettes regarding their awareness, perceptions, and opinions of local laws restricting menthol cigarette retail sales and how such polices influence their smoking and purchasing behaviors. Our findings suggest that Black adults who smoke menthol cigarettes are aware of local laws restricting menthol cigarette retail sales and are ambivalent about the rationale. Our findings have implications for the development and delivery of equity-focused strategies and resources to increase awareness of and rationale for the ban; counter commercial tobacco industry interference; and facilitate smoking cessation among Black adults who experience more combustible tobacco-related morbidity and mortality than their racial/ethnic counterparts. By understanding this relevance, we can also recognize how individual awareness and perceptions are moored within and contextualized by broader social structures and systemic inequities that warrant policy considerations.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Flavored tobacco products are not restricted in Vietnam or the Philippines despite the high smoking prevalence among those 15 years of age and older (24% and 23%, respectively). There are no published reports to our knowledge on the levels of flavor chemicals in the cigarettes sold in these two countries. METHODS: Cigarettes were purchased in Vietnam (32 brand variants) and the Philippines (19 brand variants) during 2020. Chemical analyses gave the mg/filter, mg/rod, and mg/stick (= mg/(filter + rod)) values for 180 individual flavor chemicals. Values were calculated for menthol, clove-related compounds, and ""other flavor chemicals"" (OFCs). RESULTS: Five flavor groupings were found among the brand variants purchased in Vietnam: menthol + OFCs (n = 15), OFCs only (n = 8), nonflavored (n = 7), menthol + OFCs with a clove flavorant (n = 1) and menthol only (n = 1). Three flavor groupings were found among the brand variants purchased in the Philippines: menthol + OFCs (n = 10), nonflavored (n = 5), and menthol only (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: A range of flavored cigarette products are being offered by tobacco companies in Vietnam and the Philippines, presumably to maximize cigarette sales. Regulation of flavor chemicals should be considered in these two countries. IMPLICATIONS: Article 9 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), ratified by both Vietnam and the Philippines, states that ""there is no justification for permitting the use of ingredients, such as flavoring agents, which help make tobacco products attractive."" Flavors increase product appeal, adolescent initiation and experimentation, and difficulty quitting. These analyses found that cigarettes purchased in Vietnam and the Philippines contained menthol and other flavor chemicals. Tobacco companies are offering multiple flavor chemical profiles and nominally nonflavored versions in these countries; regulation of flavor chemicals should be considered in these two countries.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

However, understanding tobacco as a social justice issue and the industry's role in perpetuating inequities remains limited. This study explored youth and young adult awareness of tobacco marketing and perceptions of tobacco marketing as a social justice issue. AIMS AND METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with youth and young adults in 2020 and 2021, including individuals who used tobacco and e-cigarettes and those who did not use either. Online surveys were conducted in 2021 with youth (n = 1227) and young adults (n = 2643) using AmeriSpeak's nationally representative panel, oversampling for black and Hispanic Americans and people who smoke. Perceptions of flavor bans, social justice, and industry marketing were assessed. RESULTS: Most (>80%) survey respondents agreed that tobacco companies target youth. However, only 20% saw tobacco as a social justice issue. Focus group participants regardless of their tobacco or e-cigarette use, reported higher prevalence of tobacco advertising in their communities relative to survey respondents but did not view it as targeting communities of color. Black non-Hispanic (20.9%) and Hispanic (21.4%) survey respondents perceived tobacco as a social justice issue more than white non-Hispanic (16.1%) respondents. The majority (>60%) of survey respondents supported bans on menthol and flavored tobacco, regardless of race or ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents broadly supported menthol and flavored tobacco bans and recognized tobacco-industry influence on youth. Low awareness of tobacco as a social justice issue highlights the need to raise awareness of the underlying factors driving tobacco-related disparities. IMPLICATIONS: The majority of young people see the tobacco industry as targeting them. Most young people support bans on menthol and flavored tobacco bans, with support across racial and ethnic groups. While few young respondents perceived tobacco as a social justice issue, some perceived tobacco companies as targeting low-income and communities of color. Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic respondents were more likely to perceive tobacco as a social justice issue than white non-Hispanic respondents. Efforts to raise awareness among young people of tobacco as a social justice issue may be key in addressing tobacco disparities and advancing support for flavor tobacco bans.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Now in its 30th year, the Society is taking on new challenges in tobacco control, nicotine vaping, product regulation, and public policy. AIMS AND METHODS: This Review describes the formative years of the Society from the perspective of researchers who were in leadership positions during that time, documenting how biobehavioral and clinical research in the first 10 years was a continuation of the scientific mission of the 1988 United States Surgeon General's Report on Nicotine Addiction and summarizing organizational innovations during each president's term of office. CONCLUSIONS: The Society's promotion of scientific research served as a catalyst for funding, policy, and regulation, setting the stage for its influence and credibility. IMPLICATIONS: This Commentary provides context and an overview of the scientific research and the organizational innovations that occurred during the early years of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco using publications and available documentation. The Society was able to thrive because biobehavioral research on nicotine addiction provided the scientific underpinnings for the tobacco control enterprise as a whole. The objective of this Commentary is to describe formative events in the Society's history based on the accomplishments of its early leaders.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

OBJECTIVE: Examine the extent to which tobacco-related social media research is cited in government policy documents. SEARCH METHODS: Peer-reviewed tobacco-related social media studies were searched for on Web of Science, PubMed, and other databases from 2004 to 2022. The DOI number for each identified article was then used to search the Overton database to find policy documents citing such research. A secondary, manual search of national and international governmental agency websites was also conducted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Documents were included in this study if they were tobacco-related, written in English, cited social media research in the document text and reference section, and were published by a governmental office or agency. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The analytic sample consisted of (n = 38) government policy documents, and were coded for content themes, agency type, document type, and subsequent citations. MAIN RESULTS: When this research was utilized, it was often in the context of highlighting tobacco industry marketing practices, bringing attention to an issue (eg, youth e-cigarette use), and/or describing how social media platforms can be used as a data source to understand tobacco-related attitudes and behaviors. Agencies that often cited this research were the WHO, FDA, and CDC. The document types included research reports, policy recommendations, industry guidance, legal complaints, and practice-based recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco-related social media research has been utilized by government agencies in the last decade to guide the policy process. IMPLICATIONS: Tobacco-related social media research has been used in government policy documents to detail tobacco industry marketing and bring attention to youth exposure to protobacco content online. Continued surveillance of social media may be necessary to track the changing tobacco landscape.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

ONPs come in a variety of flavors and are often marketed as ""tobacco-free,"" but research on ONP use-motivations and related experiences is limited. AIMS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional web-based survey collected self-report data on ONP use-characteristics (eg, frequency), brands and flavors used, use-motivations, dependence (Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence-Smokeless Tobacco [FTND-ST]), and ONP-related adverse events (AEs) experienced. RESULTS: The sample included 118 adults who reported current (past 30-day) ONP use. On average (SD), participants reported ONP use on 13 (6) days during the past month. Most participants (% of the sample) also reported the use of tobacco cigarettes (74%) and/or electronic cigarettes (53%) during the past month. Zyn (27%) and Lucy (19%) were the most currently used ONP brands with mint (23%) and tobacco (16%) as the most currently used flavors. The availability of preferred flavors was the most frequently reported (31%) ONP use-motivation. The sample demonstrated significant dependence levels (FTND-ST = 7, SD = 2). Reported AEs included mouth lesions (48%), upset stomach (39%), sore mouth (37%), sore throat (21%), and nausea (9%). Results should be interpreted in the context of study limitations, including using a relatively small and homogeneous online convenience sample. Acknowledging the limitations, this sample was deemed appropriate to include considering the novelty of the findings, the dearth of related research, and the necessity of examining foundational ONP use-characteristics (eg, topography, AEs); however, future research should consider recruiting larger and more generalizable samples. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of preferred flavors was a key ONP use-motivation in this sample. Mint and tobacco were the most currently used flavors, with Zyn and Lucy being the most currently used ONP brands. Participants reported dependence and a substantial number of ONP-related AEs. Nationally representative surveys should investigate ONP use along with outcomes included in the current study (eg, AEs) to inform ONP surveillance and policy development efforts. IMPLICATIONS: This study is among the first to assess reasons for initiating/maintaining ONP use as well as other relevant use-experiences (eg, AEs, dependence). These results highlight the role of flavors and nicotine dependence in ONP use, which are important considerations for informing ONP regulations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

This study summarized the literature that analyzed tobacco-related social media data, including domain, social media platform, tobacco product type, and themes of findings, among other variables. AIMS AND METHODS: PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Communication Source were searched between 2004 and 2022. Peer-reviewed articles were included if they were written in English, included at least one tobacco-related term, and one social media-related term, and analyzed a social media post. Two coders screened all-titles and abstracts. The final sample consisted of (n = 255) articles. Studies were coded for domain, social media platform, tobacco product type, data source, type of data, coding and analytic method, and presence of validation procedure, among other variables. RESULTS: A total of 10 504 820 581 tobacco-related social media posts were assessed across 255 studies. User experience (54.1%) and promotion (23.1%) were the most researched domains. Researchers used data from Twitter the most (42.7%). Text (43.1%) was the most common type of data analyzed. Thematic analysis (80.8%) was the most common analytic technique. Themes of findings from content analyses often pertained to the health effects of tobacco use (61.0%) and promotion (44.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Researchers have analyzed billions of tobacco-related social media posts to describe user experience with, and promotions related to, tobacco products like e-cigarettes on platforms like Twitter. Future research may examine tobacco-related social media data from newer platforms like TikTok. IMPLICATIONS: Real-time surveillance of tobacco-related content on social media can keep the tobacco control community abreast of tobacco industry promotional strategies, user experience with tobacco products, and perceived health effects of tobacco use. A framework may be developed to establish best-practices for social media data collection and analysis, including strategies to identify posts from bot accounts and validate methodological approaches used in thematic analysis.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

To inform regulatory decisions, we examined the impact of MRTP claim specificity and content, including whether the claims produced halo effects (ie, inferring health benefits beyond what is stated). AIMS AND METHODS: Participants were 3161 US adult cigarette smokers. Using a two (general vs. specific) × 2 (risk vs. exposure) plus independent control design, we randomized participants to view one message from these conditions: general risk claim (eg, ""smoking-related diseases""), general exposure claim (eg, ""chemicals in smoke""), specific risk claim (eg, ""lung cancer""), specific exposure claim (eg, ""arsenic""), or control. Claims described the benefits of completely switching from cigarettes to the heated tobacco product IQOS. RESULTS: MRTP claims of any sort elicited a higher willingness to try IQOS relative to control (d = 0.09, p = .043). Claims also elicited lower perceived risk of disease and exposure to harmful chemicals for completely switching from cigarettes to IQOS (d = -0.32 and -0.31) and partially switching (d = -0.25 and d = -0.26; all p < .05). Relative to specific MRTP claims, general MRTP claims led to lower perceived risk and exposure for complete switching (d = -0.13 and d = -0.16) and partial switching (d = -0.14 and d = -0.12; all p < .05). Risk and exposure MRTP claims had similar effects (all p > .05). DISCUSSION: MRTP claims led to lower perceived risk and exposure, and higher willingness to try IQOS. General claims elicited larger effects than specific claims. MRTP claims also promoted unintended halo effects (eg, lower perceived risk of disease and chemical exposure for partial switching). IMPLICATIONS: We found evidence that MRTP claims promoted health halo effects. In light of these findings, the FDA should require research on halo effects prior to authorization. Further, if an MRTP claim is authorized, FDA should require tobacco manufacturers to conduct post-market surveillance of how the claim affects consumer understanding, including partial switching perceived risk and exposure beliefs, as well as monitoring of dual-use behaviors.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

No literature has yet examined long-term changes in e-cigarette sales patterns changed in relation to the FDA enforcement action. AIMS AND METHODS: We analyzed U.S. e-cigarette sales using Nielsen retail scanner data between March 2017 and December 2021, describing e-cigarette sales trends overall, by device type, and by flavor category. We also performed joinpoint regression analysis on the sales trends to detect significant changes in the rate of change of sales over time. RESULTS: The FDA enforcement action was associated with a sharp initial decrease in prefilled pod dollar sales, followed by a steady increase from April 2020 through the end of 2021, growing beyond the previous maximum in August 2019. We also observed a dramatic change in the composition of flavors sold: A large decline in mint-flavored pod sales was offset by a similar increase in menthol-flavored sales. Simultaneously, disposable product sales increased nearly ten-fold from July 2019 to July 2020 before stabilizing, dominated by fruit-flavored products. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest rapid product substitution without a long-term decline in e-cigarette sales in association with the enforcement action, along with a growing dominance of youth-friendly flavors, contrasting against FDA policy goals. Our study revealed the weakness of the ""patchy"" enforcement action, raising concern about its unintended consequences as consumption simply shifted to other e-cigarette products. IMPLICATIONS: This is the first detailed longitudinal study on e-cigarette sales trends in the United States following the FDA flavor enforcement action, with novel findings on flavor trends and their relation to policy events. We report sales overall, by product type, and by flavor category, and highlight several important trends following the action, such as the rise and persistence of disposable e-cigarettes increasingly and overwhelmingly dominated by youth-friendly flavors, and likely substitution of prefilled e-cigarette flavors without any long-term decline in sales. Our results highlight the weaknesses of ""patchy"" regulation and suggest the need for a more comprehensive approach to flavor regulation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

A Qualitative Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Encouraging smokers to quit smoking tobacco using e-cigarettes could substantially reduce smoking-related diseases. Vape shops (VS) therefore have the potential to play an important role in supporting smoking cessation. The aim of this study was to explore how to deliver a vape shop-based smoking cessation intervention in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Semistructured telephone interviews were undertaken with four stakeholder groups: 20 stop smoking service (SSS) providers, seven tobacco control leads, seven smokers/vapers, and five vape shop staff. Interviews were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Stakeholder groups were positive about the idea of delivering a vape shop-based intervention. Themes that were identified were the characteristics of the intervention (duration and timing; delivery; style and content; and product provisions); barriers to the intervention (challenges for new vapers; false information; tobacco company involvement; and conflicts of interest); facilitators to the intervention (positive views on vaping; cost-effectiveness; popularity; and accessibility); and considerations for the intervention (data protection and privacy; aesthetics; and regulation and management). The results suggest that the intervention should be delivered by vape shop workers with mandatory training with the support of SSS. Most stakeholders agreed quitting vaping was not a priority, but that information on how to reduce nicotine use should be given. Concerns around privacy, General Data Protection Regulation, misinformation about vaping, and tobacco company involvement would need to be addressed. CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders agree that VS should offer stop smoking interventions and hold similar opinions on how this should be delivered. IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests that smokers, vapers, and other key stakeholders are positive about the idea of a stop-smoking vape shop-based intervention and that they hold similar opinions on how this should be delivered. Most participants felt that this should be primarily delivered by trained vape shop staff and run with support from SSS. Participants agreed that a stop-smoking vape shop-based intervention should be flexible in terms of the type, duration, and frequency of support provided, and that the intervention should comprise both technical guidance on using a vape and behavioral support to prevent a return to smoking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

To determine how US e-cigarette flavor restrictions might influence tobacco use behavior, this study assesses responses to real-world and hypothetical flavor bans among young adults who use flavored e-cigarettes. AIMS AND METHODS: An online, national survey of young adults ages 18-34 who use flavored e-cigarettes was conducted in 2021 (n = 1253), oversampling states affected by e-cigarette flavor restrictions. Participants were asked about their responses to real-world changes in the availability of flavored e-cigarettes. Unaffected participants were asked to predict their responses under a hypothetical federal e-cigarette flavor ban. RESULTS: The most common response to real-world changes in flavored e-cigarettes availability was to continue vaping (~80%). Among those who exclusively vaped, 12.5% switched to combustible tobacco. Quitting all forms of tobacco was selected by 5.3% of those exclusively vape versus 4.2% who dual use. Under a hypothetical federal ban, more than half of respondents stated they would continue vaping; 20.9% and 42.5% of those who exclusively vape versus dual use would use combustible tobacco. Quitting all tobacco products was endorsed by 34.5% and 17.2% of those who exclusively vape versus dual use. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults who vape flavored e-cigarettes have mixed responses to e-cigarette flavor bans. Under both real-world and hypothetical e-cigarette flavor bans, most who use flavored e-cigarettes continue vaping. Under a real-world ban, the second most common response among those who exclusively vape is to switch to smoking; under a hypothetical federal ban, it is to quit all tobacco. IMPLICATIONS: This is the first national survey to directly ask young adults who use flavored e-cigarettes about their responses to real-world changes in flavored e-cigarette availability due to state and local flavor restrictions. The survey also asked individuals to predict their responses under a hypothetical federal e-cigarette flavor ban. Most who use flavored e-cigarettes would continue vaping following e-cigarette flavor restrictions, but many would switch to or continue using combustible tobacco, highlighting potential negative public health consequences of these policies. Policymakers must consider the impact of e-cigarette flavor bans on both e-cigarette and cigarette use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,No,

This study asks how young adults who use menthol cigarettes respond to changes in menthol cigarette availability. AIMS AND METHODS: An online survey of young adults ages 18-34 who reported smoking menthol cigarettes on ≥7 of 30 days around Thanksgiving 2019 (n = 734), oversampling Massachusetts-the first state with a menthol ban. Participants reported their tobacco use behavior following real-world menthol cigarette bans or predicted their behavior under a hypothetical federal ban. RESULTS: Most respondents who exclusively smoked versus dual used with e-cigarettes continued smoking/using combustible tobacco following real-world bans (95.3% vs. 86.9%), accessing menthol cigarettes from other jurisdictions. Fewer who smoked exclusively responded by using e-cigarettes compared to those who dual used (3.9% vs. 43.7%). Quitting all tobacco use (ie, no smoking, vaping, or any tobacco use) was uncommon for both groups (3.6% vs. 9.0%). Under a hypothetical ban, majorities of those who exclusively smoke and who dual use predicted they would continue smoking (72.2% vs. 71.8%); fewer who smoke exclusively would use e-cigarettes compared to those who dual use (14.7% vs. 41.4%). Those who smoke exclusively were more likely to report quitting all tobacco compared to those who dual use (29.6% vs. 12.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Under real-world and hypothetical menthol cigarette bans, most respondents continued smoking. However, more young adults continued smoking following real-world bans, reflecting the limitations of local/state restrictions when menthol cigarettes are available in other jurisdictions. IMPLICATIONS: This survey asked young adults who use menthol cigarettes how they responded to real-world changes in the availability of menthol cigarettes; 89% reported continuing to smoke. Those who smoked exclusively were far less likely to respond by switching to e-cigarettes compared to people who dual used both products. Under a hypothetical federal menthol cigarette ban, 72% of young adults predicted that they would continue smoking. Quitting all tobacco was less common in the real-world scenario compared to the hypothetical ban. Access to menthol cigarettes in other jurisdictions and flavored cigars likely dampen the public health benefit of menthol cigarette bans.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, clinical trials for smoking cessation typically define the primary endpoint as a measure of abstinence at a single timepoint distal to the intervention, typically 3-12 months. This reinforces the concept of tobacco outcomes as a dichotomous state-one is, or is not, abstinent. Fortunately, there are several approaches available to handle longitudinal data that reflect the relapsing and remitting nature of tobacco use during treatment studies. In this paper, sponsored by the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco's Treatment Research Network, we present an introductory overview of these techniques and their application in smoking cessation clinical trials. Topics discussed include models to examine abstinence outcomes (eg, trajectory models of abstinence, models for transitions in smoking behavior, models for time to event), models that examine reductions in tobacco use, and models to examine joint outcomes (eg, examining changes in the use of more than one tobacco product). Finally, we discuss three additional relevant topics (ie, heterogeneity of effects, handling missing data, and power and sample size) and provide summary information about the type of model that can be used based on the type of data collected and the focus of the study. We encourage investigators to familiarize themselves with these techniques and use them in the analysis of data from clinical trials of smoking cessation treatment. Implications Clinical trials of tobacco dependence treatment typically measure abstinence 3-12 months after participant enrollment. However, because smoking is a chronic relapsing condition, these measures of intervention success may not accurately reflect the common trajectories of tobacco abstinence and relapse. Several analytical techniques facilitate this type of outcome modeling. This paper is meant to be an introduction to these concepts and techniques to the global nicotine and tobacco research community including which techniques can be used for different research questions with visual summaries of which types of models can be used for different types of data and research questions.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

METHODS: Data were aggregated quarterly on 67 548 past-year smokers between Q1-2007 and Q4-2022. Explanatory variables were the prevalence of (1) current e-cigarette use among smokers and (2) e-cigarette use during a quit attempt. Outcomes were rates of quit attempts and overall quits among past-year smokers, and the quit success rate and use of licensed treatments among those who made a quit attempt. RESULTS: The success rate of quit attempts increased by 0.040% (95% CI 0.019; 0.062) for every 1% increase in the prevalence of e-cigarette use during a quit attempt. No clear evidence was found for an association between current e-cigarette use and the quit attempt rate (Badj = 0.008 [95% CI -0.045; 0.061]) or overall quit rate (Badj = 0.063 [-0.031; 0.158]); or between use of e-cigarettes during a quit attempt and the overall quit rate (Badj = 0.030 [-0.054; 0.114]), use of prescription medication (varenicline/bupropion/nicotine replacement therapy [NRT]: Badj = -0.036 [-0.175; 0.102]), or use of over-the-counter NRT (Badj = -0.052 [-0.120; 0.015]). There was no clear evidence this pattern of associations has changed substantially over time. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the prevalence of e-cigarette use in England through 2022 have been positively associated with the success rate of quit attempts but not clearly associated with the quit attempt rate, overall quit rate, or use of licensed smoking cessation treatments. IMPLICATIONS: If the association between the increase in e-cigarette use and the quit success rate is causal, then the use of e-cigarettes in quit attempts has helped in the region of 30 000 to 50 000 additional smokers in England to successfully quit each year since they became popular in 2013, over and above the number who were quitting before the advent of e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

A Scoping Review of the Conceptualization of Flavored Cigarillos.,"INTRODUCTION: To identify how flavor is conceptualized with respect to cigarillos to illuminate areas of concordance and discordance and provide a pathway for the harmonization of tobacco flavor measurement. AIMS AND METHODS: Three methods were used to identify research measuring flavors respective to cigarillo products including: (1) querying research databases using key words ""cigarillo,"" ""tobacco"" and ""flavor""/'flavour,' (2) sub-sampling of the eligible literature with backward and forward reference searching, and (3) a bibliographic search of key experts. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts. Inclusion criteria required manuscripts to be available in English, published prior to 3/1/2022, be original and peer-reviewed, and include a measure of flavor pertaining to cigarillo products. A total of 163 manuscripts met these criteria and were subsequently evaluated. RESULTS: Cigarillo flavor determinations were made based on the presence of flavoring agents, sensory characteristics, marketing or package characteristics, pre-defined lists, the absence of any of these, and/or were undefined. Individual flavors and their related classifications were not altogether mutually exclusive due to differences in conceptualization which has evolved over time. CONCLUSIONS: Flavor measures continue to evolve, likely in response to both tobacco control policies and industry shifts. There is a lack of standardization in flavor conceptualization that can be ameliorated through intentional integration of multiple forms of research such as identifying patterns of flavoring agents and/or marketing strategies that elicit a specific flavor profile. By doing this, we may more comprehensively evaluate the impact of flavors, their constituents, and related marketing strategies on broader population health. IMPLICATIONS: There are discrepancies in the conceptualization of flavor in tobacco and nicotine products. The lack of standardized, definitive language limits our ability to comprehensively evaluate the population-level health impact of flavors in addition to our ability to effectively inform, implement, and enforce policies restricting flavors in tobacco and nicotine products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

AIMS AND METHODS: Data are from repeat cross-sectional online surveys conducted between 2017 and 2022 among youth aged 16-19 in Canada, England, and the United States (US). Participants were 23 145 respondents who vaped and/or smoked in the past 30 days. Four dependence indicators were assessed for smoking and vaping (perceived addiction, frequent strong urges, time to first use after waking, days used in past month) and two for vaping only (use events per day, e-cigarette dependence scale). Regression models examined differences by survey wave and country, adjusting for sex, age, race, and exclusive/dual use. RESULTS: All six indicators of dependence increased between 2017 and 2022 among youth who vaped in the past 30 days (p < .001 for all). For example, more youth reported strong urges to vape at least most days in 2022 than in 2017 (Canada: 26.5% to 53.4%; England: 25.5% to 45.4%; US: 31.6% to 50.3%). In 2017, indicators of vaping dependence were substantially lower than for smoking; however, by 2022, youth vaping was associated with a greater number of days used in the past month (Canada, US), shorter time to first use (all countries), and a higher likelihood of frequent strong urges (Canada, US) compared to youth smoking. CONCLUSIONS: From 2017 to 2022, indicators of vaping dependence increased substantially. By 2022, vaping dependence indices were comparable to those of smoking. IMPLICATIONS: Indicators of vaping dependence among youth have increased substantially since 2017 to levels that are comparable to cigarette dependence among youth who smoke. Future research should examine factors underlying the increase in dependence among youth who vape, including changes to the nicotine profile and design of e-cigarette products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

This study describes the use of new survey questions that more specifically ask whether participants who vape are vaping nicotine, cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), or another substance. AIMS AND METHODS: Adults, who reported any past 30-day tobacco use, from five New England states participated in an online survey from April 2021 to July 2022. Participants who vaped were asked, ""Have you used any of the following vape substances in the past 30 days?"" with the possible responses of nicotine, cannabis, CBD, other, and ""don't know."" Dual use of both nicotine and cannabis was defined as the vaping of both nicotine and cannabis and/or CBD in the past 30 days, operationalized as a dichotomous outcome. Data were collected in monthly, repeated cross-sectional waves. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine correlates of dual-vaping. RESULTS: The analytic sample included 1547 adults who reported past 30-day tobacco use (mean age 42.9 years, 62.8% female, 85.4% White, 48.5% income of less than $50 000). Over one-quarter (26.1%) reported dual-vaping in the past 30 days. Identifying as male (p = .002) and self-rated anxiety (p = .043) were associated with a higher odds of dual-vaping. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that a sizable proportion of a sample of New England adults who have used tobacco in the past 30 days are dual-vaping nicotine and cannabis. Adequate survey measures for assessing the vaping of multiple substances can help in better screening and characterization of health behaviors around dual-use. IMPLICATIONS: This study addresses a key gap in adequate survey measures for assessing vaping of multiple substances. We found that among adults with past 30-day tobacco use, dual-vaping was prevalent and associated with different correlates, such as self-reported anxiety and education level, compared to sole-vaping of nicotine or cannabis. Our findings may help in characterizing and targeting future population-level surveillance and intervention efforts for multiple substance use behaviors.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

AIMS AND METHODS: We used data from 57 778 adult cigarette smokers participating in a nationally representative monthly cross-sectional survey between January 2008 and September 2023. We estimated monthly time trends in mean daily consumption of (1) any, (2) manufactured, and (3) hand-rolled cigarettes among all smokers and by main type of cigarettes smoked, smoking frequency, age, gender, occupational social grade, region, nicotine replacement therapy use, and vaping status. RESULTS: Overall cigarette consumption fell from 13.6 [95% CI = 13.3 to 13.9] to 10.6 [10.5 to 10.8] per day between January 2008 and October 2019 (a 22% decrease), then remained stable up to September 2023. Over this period, the proportion mainly or exclusively smoking hand-rolled cigarettes increased (from 30.6% [29.1%-32.1%] in 2008 to 52.1% [49.7%-54.5%] in 2023). As a result, manufactured cigarette consumption fell by 47%, from 9.5 [9.2-9.8] per day in January 2008 to 5.0 [4.7-5.3] in September 2023, while hand-rolled cigarette consumption increased by 35%, from 4.2 [3.9-4.4] to 5.6 [5.3-5.9], respectively. The decline in overall cigarette consumption was observed across all subgroups, but was greater among non-daily smokers, younger smokers, and those who vaped. CONCLUSIONS: Over the last 15 years, the average number of cigarettes consumed each day by smokers in England has fallen by almost a quarter, but has plateaued since October 2019. There has been a sharp decline in the number of manufactured cigarettes consumed and an increase in the number of hand-rolled cigarettes consumed, as smokers have increasingly shifted towards using hand-rolled tobacco. IMPLICATIONS: While average cigarette consumption in England has fallen over the past 15 years, this declining trend has stalled (and reversed in some population groups) since 2019. The availability of cheap, hand-rolled tobacco appears to be undermining policies that aim to reduce smoking by raising the price of tobacco (eg, through taxation) and could be targeted to reignite the decline in cigarette consumption.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study investigated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of different nicotine formulations (salt vs. free-base) and concentrations that might influence systemic nicotine absorption and appeal of e-cigarettes. AIMS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, within-subject crossover study, 20 non-nicotine-naïve participants were switched among three e-liquids (free-base nicotine 20 mg/mL, nicotine salt 20 mg/mL, nicotine salt 40 mg/mL) using a refillable pod system and a standardized vaping protocol (one puff every 30 seconds, 10 puffs total). Serum nicotine concentrations and vital signs were assessed over 180 minutes; direct effects, craving, satisfaction, withdrawal, and respiratory symptoms were measured using questionnaires. CYP2A6 genotypes and the nicotine metabolite ratio were also assessed. RESULTS: Eleven (55%) participants were male and the median age was 23.5 years (range 18-67). All three formulations differed significantly in peak serum nicotine concentration (baseline adjusted Cmax, median (range): 12.0 ng/mL (1.6-27.3), 5.4 ng/mL (1.9-18.7), and 3.0 ng/mL (1.3-8.8) for nicotine salt 40 mg/mL, nicotine salt 20 mg/mL and free-base 20 mg/mL, respectively). All groups reached Cmax 2.0-2.5 minutes (median) after their last puff. Differences in subjective effects were not statistically significant. No serious adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Free-base 20 mg/mL formulations achieved lower blood nicotine concentrations than nicotine salt 20 mg/mL, while 40 mg/mL nicotine salt yielded concentrations similar to cigarette smoking. The findings can inform regulatory policy regarding e-liquids and their potential use in smoking cessation. IMPLICATIONS: Nicotine salt formulations inhaled by an e-cigarette led to higher nicotine delivery compared to nicotine-free-base formulations with the same nicotine concentration. These findings should be considered in future regulatory discussions. The 40 mg/mL nicotine salt formulation showed similar nicotine delivery as combustible cigarettes, albeit at concentrations over the maximum limit for e-liquids allowed in the European Union. Nicotine delivery resembling combustible cigarettes might be beneficial for smokers willing to quit to adequately alleviate withdrawal symptoms. However, increased nicotine delivery can also pose a public health risk, raising concerns about abuse liability, especially among youth and nonsmokers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

A comprehensive Tobacco Action Plan including plain packaging, a point-of-sale display ban, a ban on characterizing flavors (in products other than cigarettes), a strengthening of the promotion and marketing ban, a ban on the sale of novel nicotine products to minors, smoke-and nicotine-free-school hours in all-schools with minors, and a significant increase in tobacco tax, was adopted in Denmark in 2019. AIMS AND METHODS: Eleven people involved or very close to the advocacy process were invited, two did not respond and nine attended our research center. We used the nominal group technique, a consensus method, to identify the most important driving factors for passing the Tobacco Action Plan. RESULTS: The round-robin identified 39 driving factors merged into 13 in the clarification phase. In the ranking phase, participants agreed on seven factors that they perceived have strongly influenced the political will to strengthen national tobacco control comprehensively. The most important factors were national data and evidence, a nationwide alliance with broad partnerships, a strict focus on young people, continuous media coverage, intensive lobbying by many different advocates, making it a community agenda-not a political one, and effective professional campaigns. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings agree with experiences from other countries that significantly improved tobacco control. The Danish strategy, including a nationwide alliance with broad partnerships, had a high influence on the political agenda. IMPLICATIONS: In this study, there was a consensus that seven factors strongly influenced the political will to comprehensively strengthen the national tobacco control in Denmark in a short time: national data and evidence; a nationwide alliance with broad partnerships; a strict focus on children and young people; continuous media coverage; intensive lobbying by many different advocates; making it a community agenda-not a political one, and effective professional campaigns. This is consistent with findings from other countries.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Financial incentives for smoking cessation are evidence-based, but a family-level incentive structure has not been evaluated. We used a community-based participatory research and qualitative approach to culturally adapt a smoking cessation intervention with ANAI families. AIMS AND METHODS: We conducted individual, semistructured telephone interviews with 12 ANAI adults who smoke, 12 adult family members, and 13 Alaska Tribal Health System stakeholders statewide between November 2022 and March 2023. Through content analysis, we explored intervention receptivity, incentive preferences, culturally aligned recruitment and intervention messaging, and future implementation needs. RESULTS: Participants were receptive to the intervention. Involving a family member was viewed as novel and aligned with ANAI cultural values of commitment to community and familial interdependence. Major themes included choosing a family member who is supportive and understanding, keeping materials positive and encouraging, and offering cash and noncash incentives for family members to choose (eg, fuel, groceries, activities). Participants indicated that messaging should emphasize family collaboration and that cessation resources and support tips should be provided. Stakeholders also reinforced that program materials should encourage the use of other existing evidence-based cessation therapies (eg, nicotine replacement, counseling). CONCLUSIONS: Adaptations, grounded in ANAI cultural strengths, were made to the intervention and recruitment materials based on participant feedback. Next steps include a beta-test for feasibility and a randomized controlled trial for efficacy. IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study to design and adapt a financial incentives intervention promoting smoking cessation among ANAI peoples and the first to involve the family system. Feedback from this formative work was used to develop a meaningful family-level incentive structure with ANAI people who smoke and family members and ensure intervention messaging is supportive and culturally aligned. The results provide qualitative knowledge that can inform future family-based interventions with ANAI communities, including our planned randomized controlled trial of the intervention.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

A Population Survey of Adults in England.,"BACKGROUND: Increasingly, people smoke cigarettes outdoors and avoid exposing bystanders to harm. People may not have the same motivation to vape outdoors since e-cigarettes, unlike cigarettes, do not create side stream emissions and exhaled aerosol contains fewer toxicants than secondhand smoke. This study aims to estimate the prevalence and correlates of vaping and smoking indoors among adults in England. AIMS AND METHODS: Data came from the Health Survey for England 2019, a cross-sectional household survey. Adults who vape or smoke (N = 1530) were asked whether they had vaped or smoked indoors inside the home, car, or other places within the past 7 days. Logistic regression was used to estimate prevalence and key correlates of indoor use, including age, sex, presence of adults/children in home, housing tenure, and nicotine dependence. RESULTS: People who exclusively vaped were much more likely to use their product indoors than those who exclusively smoked (87.0% vs. 52.0%; odds ratio [OR] = 6.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.09 to 9.28). Similarly, people who dual used had higher odds of vaping than smoking indoors (62.1% vs. 44.3%; OR = 3.76, 95% CI = 2.06 to 6.84). The preference for vaping over smoking indoors was found across different locations, including at home and in cars. Those who were older, highly dependent on nicotine, and lived alone were most prone to use any product indoors. While housing tenure was not strongly associated with vaping indoors, those living in social housing were much more likely to smoke indoors than homeowners. CONCLUSIONS: Adults in England are much more likely to vape than smoke indoors. Age, nicotine dependence, and living alone are strongly associated with both behaviors. IMPLICATIONS: Our results show that people have a strong preference for vaping over smoking indoors, including in the home. Given the high prevalence of vaping indoors, policy makers, landlords, and businesses must weigh up the ethics, benefits, and harms of extending smoke-free laws to include e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Marketing exposure is one causal factor for adolescent smoking and e-cigarette use. Currently, China restricts cigarette and e-cigarette ads in public places and online; however, there may not be full policy compliance. We collected real-time data in the natural environment to estimate how much and where Chinese adolescents-a group susceptible to smoking and e-cigarette use-are exposed to cigarette and e-cigarette marketing to inform policy responses. AIMS AND METHODS: In June 2022, we conducted a 7-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study with 15-16-year-olds (n = 96) across eight Chinese cities. Participants completed up to 42 EMA surveys (six per day), sent at random intervals outside of school hours. In each survey, participants reported whether they saw (1) displays and (2) ads in the past hour (none, cigarette, e-cigarette, both) in the past hour. We also captured the source of cigarette/e-cigarette ad exposure. RESULTS: Most participants were exposed to cigarette and/or e-cigarette displays (89.6%) or ads (79.2%) more than 7 days. On average, participants reported past-hour exposure to displays 12.7 times and past-hour exposure to ads 10.8 times over the week. The most common sources of cigarette ads were public places (eg, kiosks, supermarkets); the most common sources of e-cigarette ad exposure were social media/internet or e-cigarette stores. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the need to enhance enforcement of restrictions on cigarette and e-cigarette ads in public places and online in China and extend restrictions to ban displays. IMPLICATIONS: Marketing exposure is a causal factor in youth smoking and e-cigarette use. We used EMA to estimate cigarette and e-cigarette display and ad exposure among Chinese adolescents. On average, participants reported past-hour exposure to cigarette and/or e-cigarette displays 13 times and past-hour exposure to cigarette and/or e-cigarette ads 11 times more than 1 week. Most saw ads in public places and online. Results suggest strengthening implementation of China's ban on cigarette and e-cigarette ads in public places and online and banning product displays. These are policy responses that can contribute to reducing adolescent cigarette and e-cigarette uptake in China.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This scoping review summarizes evidence on ONPs and explores their potential public health impact. AIMS AND METHODS: We conducted a structured literature search for empirical studies across three electronic databases through January 10, 2024. Outcomes included ONP product characteristics, use patterns, beliefs and perceptions, toxicity, and marketing and sales. RESULTS: Sixty-two studies were included, 17 were industry-funded. Most studies were from the United States. While large variations across studies were observed in ONP youth prevalence estimates, nationally representative U.S. studies find current use at 1.5% and lifetime use below 2.5% through 2023. Between 35% and 42% of U.S. adolescents and young adults have heard of ONPs, and 9-21% of tobacco-naïve youth were susceptible to trying them. U.S. adult-use estimates varied widely (0.8%-3% current; 3%-16% lifetime use) and were limited to populations with a history of tobacco use. The chemical composition of ONPs suggests fewer harmful/potentially harmful compounds at lower levels than cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (SLT), except formaldehyde. Industry-funded studies find substantially less cytotoxicity compared to cigarettes and suggest that higher nicotine-strength ONPs can deliver nicotine at levels comparable to or higher than SLT or cigarettes, although with slower nicotine release than cigarettes. Evidence on the cytotoxicity of ONPs relative to SLT is mixed. CONCLUSIONS: ONPs appear to be less toxic than cigarettes and deliver comparable nicotine, presenting an alternative for combustible product users, although key data are mainly available from industry-funded studies. Data from independent research is critically needed. Industry marketing of ONPs may encourage initiation in youth and situational and dual use in adults. IMPLICATIONS: The review provides an initial assessment of the potential role of ONPs in harm reduction and aims to determine unintended consequences of their use (youth uptake and dual-use) and identify populations that disproportionately use the product. This information is essential for tobacco regulatory bodies in determining the net public health impact of nicotine pouches.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Unauthorized Claims Used by Herbal Cigarette Manufacturers.,"INTRODUCTION: Herbal cigarettes are made with non-tobacco plant materials (eg, tea leaves, hemp), are typically sold pre-rolled in packs and with filters, and are combusted and smoked like tobacco cigarettes. Herbal cigarette manufacturers have a history of making misleading health claims and at least one company has previously settled with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over deceptive advertising. This study examined current claims and product characteristics of herbal cigarettes sold by a popular online retailer. AIMS AND METHODS: We searched Amazon.com for ""herbal cigarettes"" and ""hemp cigarettes"" and identified all herbal cigarette products sold on the first page of search results (n = 51). Two coders independently content analyzed each product's Amazon page for claims (eg, smoking cessation, health), product characteristics (eg, flavors), and presence of disclaimers and warnings. RESULTS: Overall, 78.4% of product pages made smoking cessation claims (eg, ""A more scientific way to quit smoking,"" ""…decreases nicotine craving symptom and helps to quit tobacco smoking""). Further, 45.1% of product pages included claims describing lower risk/exposure compared to tobacco products (eg, ""…without the addictive nicotine and toxic chemicals found in tobacco cigarettes""). Some herbal products were available in multiple flavors, including menthol (21.6%) and fruit (17.7%). Only 35.3% of products included visible health warnings on product packaging. CONCLUSIONS: Many herbal cigarette products sold on Amazon.com make unauthorized cessation and health claims. Regulatory agencies must act decisively to stop the misleading advertising of these products and develop appropriate warnings to educate the public about the potential harms. IMPLICATIONS: This content analysis documents the use of unauthorized and misleading claims made in the marketing of herbal cigarettes. These findings highlight the need for enforcement of existing federal regulations, which prohibit deceptive advertising. Research is needed to inform the development of appropriate warning labels that can be used to inform consumers of the potential harms of smoking herbal cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

AIMS AND METHODS: Analysis of online national legislation databases to track NETNP bills using standard snowball search methods. RESULTS: Bills were identified in 15 out of the 33 LAC countries, accounting for a total of 91 bills targeting NETNPs. Mexico had the highest number (n = 38) of bills, followed by Brazil (n = 16), Argentina (n = 10), Colombia (n = 8), and Chile (n = 5). The remaining countries introduced two or fewer NETNP bills. Among the identified 91 bills, the majority (n = 60) addressed both electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products (HTPs), almost one-third of bills (n = 29) applied only to electronic cigarettes, and only two focused solely on HTPs. Six of the fifteen countries with identified bills, enacted one NETNP law including Barbados, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Guyana, Mexico, and Panama. Since 2019, there has been a steady increase in the amount of NETNP bills introduced in LAC. In 2017 and 2018, 10 NETNP bills were introduced each year followed by 23 NETNP bills introduced in each 2019 and 2020, 19 in 2021, and 16 by August 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The substantial increase in the number of NETNP bills introduced since 2019 indicates the growing importance of regulating NETNPs in LAC. As NETNPs continue to evolve and grow it is important to continue monitoring and evaluating tobacco and nicotine regulatory initiatives while also staying ahead of the evolving market of NETNPs. IMPLICATIONS: Previous studies have analyzed the regulatory environment of NETNPs but it is less known about legislative and regulatory efforts and attempts. This is the first known study to analyze legislative bills to regulate NETNPs in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The substantial increase in the number of NETNP bills introduced in LAC since 2019 indicates the growing importance of regulating NETNPs in LAC. As NETNPs continue to evolve and grow it is important to continue monitoring and evaluating tobacco and nicotine regulatory initiatives while also staying ahead of the evolving market of NETNPs.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

To date, few studies have presented participants with e-cigarette marketing stimuli and assessed recognition. This study examined the associations between recognition of online e-cigarette marketing stimuli and e-cigarette-related attitudes and behaviors among young adults in California. AIMS AND METHODS: A non-probability representative sample of young adults (ages 18-24; N = 1500) living in California completed an online survey assessing their recognition of online e-cigarette marketing stimuli, including image-based (ie, Instagram and email) and audiovisual (ie, YouTube and TikTok) promotions, and positive e-cigarette-related attitudes (eg, appeal of e-cigarettes) and behaviors (eg, e-cigarette use). Adjusted and weighted logistic regression analyses were used. RESULTS: A total of 79.0% (n = 1185) of young adults, including 78.1% (n = 310/397) of participants under 21 years old, recognized online e-cigarette marketing. Participants who reported recognition of stimuli, compared with those who did not, had greater odds of reporting appeal of e-cigarettes (AOR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.65 to 3.09) and e-cigarette purchase intentions (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.43) among all participants, and susceptibility to use e-cigarettes among never users (AOR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.59 to 3.29). CONCLUSIONS: Young adults in California recognized audiovisual and image-based online e-cigarette marketing. Such recognition may lead to positive e-cigarette-related attitudes and behavioral intentions, especially among never users. Future research should examine the causal relationships between the associations found in this study. Findings may inform the development and evaluation of psychometrically valid measures of online e-cigarette marketing exposures. IMPLICATIONS: Recognition of online e-cigarette marketing stimuli was associated with greater odds of reporting the appeal and benefits of e-cigarettes, purchase intentions, and lifetime e-cigarette use among all participants, and susceptibility to use e-cigarettes among never users. These findings may motivate the development and evaluation of psychometrically valid measures of online e-cigarette marketing exposures.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Greenwashing (portraying a product as natural/eco-friendly) is increasingly used by tobacco companies and may mislead consumers to believe that certain cigarettes are less harmful than others. This study assesses the effect of some common greenwashing tactics on consumer product perceptions. AIMS AND METHODS: We conducted an online experiment with 1504 participants ages 18-29, randomized to view a cigarette ad manipulated for presence-absence of a combination of four different greenwashing techniques: greenwashed ad text, greenwashed ad imagery, recycled paper ad background, and image of greenwashed cigarette pack. Participants rated perceived absolute harm, relative harm to other cigarettes, absolute addictiveness, relative addictiveness, and relative nicotine content. RESULTS: Participants who viewed ads containing greenwashed text were more likely to have inaccurate perceptions about absolute harm (AOR = 1.72), relative harm (AOR = 3.92), relative addictiveness (AOR = 2.93), and nicotine content (AOR = 2.08). Participants who viewed ads containing greenwashed imagery were more likely to have inaccurate perceptions of relative harm (AOR = 1.55), absolute addictiveness (AOR = 1.72), relative addictiveness (AOR = 1.60), and nicotine content (AOR = 1.48). Forty-two percent of those who saw an ad with all greenwashed features believed the product was less harmful than other cigarettes versus 2% of those who saw an ad without greenwashed features. CONCLUSIONS: We found that greenwashed text and imagery produced inaccurate risk perceptions. More active U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) enforcement against such greenwashing and new FDA rulemaking to prohibit unnecessary imagery in tobacco advertising and establish plain packaging requirements would help protect consumers and public health. IMPLICATIONS: These findings provide evidence that greenwashing tactics used by the tobacco industry increase inaccurate product risk perceptions. These tactics could be a way for the industry to make implicit modified risk claims, despite applicable U.S. Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act prohibitions. Findings from this study support the need for prohibitions on these tactics, and the potential for such prohibitions to help protect public health.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study examined associations between having close social connections who smoke or vape and relevant smoking and vaping outcomes. AIMS AND METHODS: This was a representative cross-sectional survey of adults (≥16 years) in England. Participants (n = 1618) were asked how many people they discuss important matters with (ie, close social connections) and how many of them smoke/vape. We tested associations between (1) smoking and (2) vaping among close social connections and participants' own smoking and vaping status; harm perceptions of e-cigarettes (among current smokers); attempts and success in quitting smoking (among past-year smokers); and use of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid (among past-year smokers who tried to quit). RESULTS: Adults with ≥1 close social connection who smoke were more likely than those with none to smoke themselves (32.8% vs. 9.4%; ORadj = 7.23[95% CI: 4.74 to 11.0]) and had an uncertain lower likelihood to quit (12.2% vs. 19.8%; ORadj = 0.46[0.17-1.23]). Those with ≥1 close social connection who vape were more likely than those with none to vape themselves (29.6% vs. 6.3%; ORadj = 5.16[3.15-8.43]) and to use e-cigarettes in their most recent attempt to quit (57.0% vs. 27.9%; ORadj = 18.0[1.80-181]), and had an uncertain higher likelihood to perceive e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes (30.8% vs. 12.2%; ORadj = 2.37[0.82-6.90]). CONCLUSIONS: In England, we replicated well-established associations with smoking and found similar evidence for vaping. People were much more likely to vape and to use e-cigarettes to quit smoking if they had close social connections who vaped. IMPLICATIONS: The cross-sectional design means it is not clear whether smoking/vaping among close social connections influences people to smoke/vape themselves, or whether people who smoke/vape select to form close social connections with others who similarly smoke/vape. Further research is required to establish causality. If the associations we observed are causal, interventions that encourage smokers to switch to vaping may have positive spillover effects on social connections' perceptions of e-cigarettes and the use of these products to support smoking cessation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study examined whether socioeconomic status (SES) and race are associated with variation in cigarette/e-cigarette relative risk perceptions, whether relative risk perceptions are associated with tobacco use behaviors, and whether SES and race moderate associations between perceptions and use behaviors. METHODS: Five waves of Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study yielded data from 1879 adults aged 55 years and older who smoked within the past 30 days during Wave 1. Adjusted longitudinal logistic models estimated associations between higher versus lower SES (""low SES"": less than high school diploma/GED and annual household income <$25 000) and race (White vs. Black/African American [AA]) and e-cigarette/cigarette relative risk perceptions, behavioral intentions, and e-cigarette use. RESULTS: Lower-SES adults were more likely to report that e-cigarettes were very/extremely harmful to health (adjusted OR [AOR]: 1.74, p < .01) and less likely to report that e-cigarettes were less harmful than cigarettes (AOR: 0.65, p < .01). Black/AA adults were less likely to report that e-cigarettes were less harmful than cigarettes. Participants rating e-cigarettes as equally/more harmful than cigarettes exhibited lower odds of intending to quit smoking or switch to e-cigarettes. Finally, Black/AA adults who also perceived e-cigarettes equally/more harmful than cigarettes exhibited greater odds of trying to reduce rather than quit smoking (AOR: 1.58, p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Many older adults who smoke perceive e-cigarettes as equally or more harmful than cigarettes, particularly low-SES and Black/AA older adults. Differences in relative risk perceptions among high-priority populations could negatively influence cessation attempts and switching behaviors. IMPLICATIONS: This study found that Black/AA and low-SES older adults who smoke cigarettes were more likely to perceive e-cigarettes as harmful or more harmful than cigarettes. The absence of accurate, evidence-based information regarding the relative health risks associated with the long-term use of various tobacco products may impede policy efforts to reduce disparities in smoking-related disease through increased cessation and/or harm reduction.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The exact quantities of these sweeteners in ONPs remain unknown. Artificial sweeteners in ONPs may reduce aversion, facilitate initiation and encourage consumption behavior. METHODS: Sucralose and acesulfame-k contents in major US-marketed ONP brands (Zyn, on!, Velo) were determined by Liquid-Chromatography-Mass-Spectrometry. Sweetener effects on aversion and consumption of ONP's were modeled in single- and two-bottle drinking tests, offering mice ONP extracts calibrated to contain nicotine levels similar to saliva of people who use smokeless tobacco. To examine the contribution of sweet taste perception, consumption behavior was compared between wild-type and sweet-taste receptor deficient mice (Tas1r2-/-). RESULTS: Acesulfame-K was detected in on!, Zyn and Velo ONPs (~0.3 to 0.9mg/pouch), including products marketed as ""Unflavored"" or ""Flavor ban approved"". In Velo ONPs, sweetened with sucralose (~0.6 to1.2mg/pouch), higher nicotine strength products contained higher sucralose levels. Tas1r2-/- mice consumed less ONP extracts than wild-type mice in both sexes. ONP extracts with both higher nicotine and sweetener strengths were tolerated by wild-type mice, but produced stronger aversion in Tas1r2-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: ONPs contain significant amounts of artificial sweeteners acesulfame-k and sucralose, with some brands adding more sweetener to higher nicotine strength ONPs. In mice, artificial sweeteners, at levels present in ONPs, increase nicotine consumption. Increasing sweetener contents facilitate consumption of higher nicotine strength ONPs. Sweetness imparted by sweetener addition to ONPs likely reduces aversive sensory effects of nicotine and other ONP constituents. IMPLICATIONS: Artificial sweeteners such as acesulfame-K or sucralose reduce aversion and likely facilitate consumption of ONPs. The marketing of some artificially sweetened ONPs as ""Unflavored"" or ""Flavor ban-approved"" suggests that the tobacco industry rejects sweet taste as a determinant for the presence of a characterizing flavor. Sweetness as imparted by artificial sweeteners in tobacco products needs to be addressed by regulators as a component of a characterizing flavor, with the aim to reduce product appeal and initiation by never users, and especially youth attracted to sweet flavors.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Little is known about how young people perceive the legitimacy and impact of the planned SFG policy in England. METHODS: We conducted seven semi-structured focus groups with 36 participants aged 12-21 (mean = 15) in England over video call and in person. Twenty-one participants were female and 15 male. Participants were purposively sampled to include those from areas of greater deprivation and for use of tobacco or e-cigarettes. Data was analyzed using the framework approach. RESULTS: Participants expressed broadly negative perceptions toward tobacco and its manufacturers. Most participants supported SFG policy goals and its focus on freedom from addiction and harm; some believed it should also encompass electronic cigarettes. Many believed the law would only be successful if it included stringent enforcement, accompanying tobacco licensing, and input from young people. A minority raised concerns about the loss of freedom to purchase tobacco. CONCLUSIONS: Communication of the freedom-giving nature of SFG is likely to resonate with many young people. Enforcement, communication, and involvement of young people in SFG should be considered carefully to maximize policy impact. IMPLICATIONS: The smokefree generation (SFG) policy's potential to offer freedom from addiction and disease can resonate with young people. Its effectiveness could be maximized through targeted enforcement in areas with high youth smoking rates and low adherence to age-of-sale laws, and through the introduction of additional policies that offer restrictive licensing of tobacco retailers. A phased approach to SFG, initially covering tobacco and later incorporating e-cigarettes as smoking prevalence declines, could balance reducing youth vaping and harm reduction; future research could investigate optimal policy conditions for this approach.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

We assessed the impact of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) findings on smoking cessation among high-risk adults who currently smoked. AIMS AND METHODS: 13 035 individuals, aged 55-77 years, attended a lung health check appointment, as part of a prospective observational cohort study (the SUMMIT Study), prior to undergoing a baseline LDCT scan. Logistic regressions examined the likelihood of smoking cessation at a 1-year follow-up appointment and its association with LDCT findings. RESULTS: 12.6% (n = 647/5135) of individuals self-reported smoking cessation at 1-year follow-up. Higher odds of quitting were found in those receiving indeterminate pulmonary nodule findings requiring a 3-month interval LDCT (aOR = 1.27; 1.01, 1.61), those with urgent findings requiring referral to secondary care (aOR = 1.55; 1.05, 2.32), and those with a possible new chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis (aOR = 1.60; 1.23, 2.06), compared to those receiving no actionable LDCT findings. Older age, Asian ethnic background, current high smoking intensity, motivation and number of quit attempts, and low nicotine dependence were associated with increased odds of quitting. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals currently smoking, at high lung cancer risk, participating in LDCT screening, and receiving incidental findings requiring a 1-year interval LDCT or primary care follow-up might therefore need additional behavioral support to quit. Tailored communication strategies depending on the severity of the LDCT findings, including additional behavioral support for those with less clinical concerning or negative findings, could increase quit rates and reduce smoking-related morbidity. IMPLICATIONS: This study reports high odds of self-reported complete smoking cessation in adults who currently smoked after receiving their LDCT findings. Though the impact of specific types of LDCT findings on smoking cessation was positive for high lung cancer risk individuals, reception of incidental findings could potentially be perceived as less severe to encourage individuals who currently smoked to quit. Clearly communicating the severity of LDCT findings along with the delivery of behavioral smoking cessation support targeted to high-risk individuals may increase their chances of complete smoking cessation and reduce lung cancer mortality.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

However, it is unclear whether IMH symptoms are associated with using different types or combinations of nicotine products (eg, combustible, noncombustible, exclusive product use, or multi-product use). The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the relationship between adolescent IMH symptoms and use of a wide variety of nicotine products by examining the association between IMH symptoms and current nicotine use from 2020 to 2023. AIMS AND METHODS: Data come from the 2020 to 2023 waves of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Adolescents Tobacco and Vaping Survey, an online repeat cross-sectional survey of adolescents aged 16-19 in Canada, England, and the United States (n = 80,427). Current nicotine use was examined in four categories: (1) no use, (2) exclusive noncombustible product use, (3) exclusive combustible product use, and (4) use of both product types. Respondents reported current symptoms of depression or anxiety, and we generated a dichotomous IMH symptoms variable (yes vs. no). We examined the association between IMH symptoms and current nicotine use using multinomial logistic regression models that adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: IMH symptoms were most strongly associated with use of both product types (adjusted relative risk ratio [ARRR]: 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 2.03), followed by exclusive noncombustible use (ARRR: 1.70, 95% CI = 1.61 to 1.80), and then exclusive combustible use (ARRR: 1.29, 95% CI = 1.21 to 1.37). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with IMH symptoms are more likely to use nicotine products in general than adolescents without IMH symptoms. Specifically, noncombustible product use may have a particularly strong relationship with poor mental health among adolescents. Longitudinal research is needed to better understand directionality. IMPLICATIONS: This study provides an up-to-date understanding of how mental health and nicotine use are related among adolescents, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Results indicate that youth mental health may be related to nicotine use, particularly noncombustible use, which is largely driven by e-cigarette use. Efforts to reduce youth e-cigarette use may consider emphasizing its relationship with mental health. Efforts to promote e-cigarette use as a less harmful alternative to cigarette smoking should be aware of the association between vaping and youth mental health.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study systematically analyzes the most viewed videos on TikTok relating to ZYN (the most popular ONP, manufactured by a subsidiary of Philip Morris International) to understand their content sentiment and patterns, as well as the demographics and potential commercial biases of their creators. METHODS: We used an Apify scraper in July 2024 to collect URLs and metadata for the top 100 most viewed videos on TikTok under the #ZYN hashtag. Profiles of content creators, plus their externally linked sites, were examined for commercial connections to ONP entities. We then undertook an inductive manifest content analysis. RESULTS: The top 100 TikTok videos identified garnered over 400 million views and over 3.8 million shares. 10.3% (n=9) of content creators had an external link to a website which sold ONPs. Videos predominantly indicated positive sentiment towards ZYN products or other ONPs (79%), and portrayed young men enthusing about the products, often employing humour. ZYN products featured directly in 71% of videos. Few videos contained disclaimers or warnings about potential risks of ONPs and only 5% portrayed ZYN as a vaping or smoking cessation tool. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest the most widely viewed content relating to ZYN on TikTok is overwhelmingly positive in sentiment, commonly featuring young men and often portraying ONP use in a humorous context, minimising risks. Many content creators actively sell ONP products through TikTok, some overtly and some via external links. IMPLICATIONS: ZYN oral nicotine pouches are presented positively and primarily for recreational purposes on TikTok. Few videos referenced ZYN for smoking cessation purposes or mentioned the risks of nicotine. Nearly 10% of the creators linked their profile to an external website selling oral nicotine pouches, which appears inconsistent with TikTok's policies. The use of humour and downplaying or omission of addiction and health risks across most of the sample echoes marketing efforts by the tobacco industry to present oral nicotine pouches as fun and safe.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Based within a large, naturalistic randomized controlled trial of e-cigarette in the United States, adults who smoke were given a 1-month sample of tank-style e-cigarette to use as they wish (n = 427) or not (n = 211). Analyses are restricted to participants from the e-cigarette group who became dual users by one month (DU; n = 315) versus participants in control group who exclusively used combustible cigarettes (EUCC; n = 182). Primary outcomes are based on changes in combustible cigarette smoking (cigarettes per day; CPD) across daily diaries within sampling period, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: DUs reported significantly more diary days of large smoking reduction (smoking 1-50% of baseline CPD: 23.1% of all diary days) and not smoking (5.6% of all diary days) than did EUCCs (6.8% and 1.4%, respectively) during sampling period (ps < .001). Among DUs, 18.4% reported smoking 1-50% of baseline CPD and 9.5% were not smoking at Week 12; 17.5% reported smoking 1-50% of baseline CPD and 9.2% were not smoking at Week 24. In contrast, among EUCCs, 7.1% reported 1-50% of baseline CPD at Week 12 and 1.7% were not smoking. At Week 24, 8.2% reported 1-50% of baseline CPD and 7.1% were not smoking. Among DUs, e-cigarette use days were associated with greater probability of non-smoking days (8%) than non-e-cigarette use days (3%, p < .001).

Motivations: ""Know the potential enemy at an individual level."" Smoking or vaping produces an initial ""bolus"" of nicotine in the blood and brain, lasting ~5 minutes with a peak concentration of ~100-200 nM. The bolus largely governs reinforcement, reward, and cognitive enhancement. A prolonged declining phase of [nicotine], with a half-time of 1-4 hours, largely suppresses withdrawal symptoms and governs the known cell biology of addiction. Next, ""Know the potential therapy,"" because individual [nicotine]t records will be useful during research on the effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy. Finally, ""Know the physiology."" The only three known effects on nAChRs in cerebrospinal fluid at the relevant [nicotine]t are activation, desensitization, and chaperoning/upregulation. Therefore, additional mechanistic insights will arise from correlating [nicotine]t with readily measurable physiological data on those effects in molecular, cellular, and brain slice systems and animal models. Interstitial fluid is the appropriate compartment for a CNM. The molecular sensor technology could employ fluorescence, as shown by progress on measuring [nicotine]t with improved variants of intensity-based nicotine-sensing fluorescent reporters (iNicSnFRs). Electrochemical measurements of [nicotine]t may also be possible. Studies like the Population Assessment of Tobacco Health would contextualize [nicotine]t measurements during each subject's ad libitum nicotine intake, hopefully at a cost <$100 for a 24-hour record.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We hypothesized that ENDS use would a) decline from 2015 to 2017 similar to national surveillance research, b) increase from 2017 to 2019 after the surging popularity of JUUL and similar pod-vapes, and then c) decline again from 2019 to 2024 after the enactment of federal tobacco policies and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also hypothesized that cigarette smoking would decline steadily over the 10 years. METHODS: Participants were 45,129 18-25-year-old Texas college students who participated in at least one of ten repeated cross-sectional surveys from 2015 to 2024. Discontinuous growth curve models were used to analyze trends in past 30-day ENDS use and cigarette smoking across the 10 years. RESULTS: Results indicated that ENDS use decreased from 2015 to 2017 (AOR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.96), increased from 2017 to 2019 (AOR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.96, 2.20), and then decreased from 2019 to 2024 (AOR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Past 30-day cigarette smoking decreased steadily across the 10-year study period (AOR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.80, 0.83). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that while cigarette use has declined over the past decade among Texas college students, there have been inconsistent changes in ENDS use. Although the present study cannot infer causality, these changes align with the timing of tobacco legislation and FDA regulations. The sharp increase in ENDS between 2017 and 2019 highlights the need to remain vigilant about new products and marketing strategies from tobacco companies, as they may undermine the effectiveness of tobacco control efforts.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

AIMS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant UK adults (n = 140). Five study groups were purposively recruited: exclusive-smokers (n = 38), exclusive-vapers (former smokers) (n = 35), dual users of smoking and vaping (n = 25), dual users of smoking and nicotine replacement therapy (n = 10), and ""never-users"" of nicotine or tobacco products (n = 32). Sociodemographic, smoking, and vaping characteristics were assessed. Participants' urine samples were analyzed for biomarkers of exposure to tobacco alkaloids, and toxicants, including 14 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), heavy metals (cadmium, lead, chromium, nickel, copper, and tin) and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (2-naphthol). Regression analysis was used to compare biomarkers by group. RESULTS: Nicotine levels varied across product users, but not significantly. After controlling for confounders, for most VOCs, biomarker levels were similar for exclusive-vapers and never-users and significantly lower than for exclusive-smokers and any dual users. There were generally no significant differences between groups for 2-naphthol or heavy metals. For NNAL, cadmium and chromium, a high percentage of values were below the limit of detection, making analyses unreliable. CONCLUSIONS: During pregnancy, former smokers who are established exclusive vapers, but not dual users, had levels of selected VOCs that were substantially lower than those for exclusive smokers and comparable with those who have never used nicotine or tobacco products. IMPLICATIONS: Based on the biomarkers assessed in this study, during pregnancy, on average, exclusive-vapers are likely to have similar levels of exposure to selected VOCs as never-users and far lower levels than exclusive-smokers or dual-users (although dual-vaping and smoking may result in less exposure than exclusive-smoking). This provides preliminary information about exposure to vaping during pregnancy and suggests that, for some biomarkers, exclusive vaping is likely to result in lower exposures than exclusive smoking or dual-use. There may be exposure to other vaping toxicants that were not explored in this study. Studies are needed to assess pregnancy and birth outcomes as well as early life effects.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Little is known regarding nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for young adult dual users, or whether to recommend quitting versus continuing e-cigarettes during smoking cessation treatment. METHODS: This 2 × 2 factorial trial randomized 396 young adult dual users (aged 18-29; ≥ 5 cigarettes/day; used e-cigarettes on ≥ 10 of past 30 days) to receive 12 weeks of combination NRT versus No NRT to quit smoking, plus text-based treatment recommendations to Quit versus Continue E-cigarettes. The primary outcome was self-reported end-of-treatment 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (PPA) from cigarettes; a secondary outcome was end-of-treatment 30-day PPA from cigarettes. RESULTS: Participants were 26.0 (SD = 6.8) years old, 52.8% female, and 26.5% non-white. At week 12, NRT increased 7-day PPA (NRT = 50.5% versus No NRT = 39.9%; OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.03, 2.29), but neither treatment recommendation (Quit E-cigarettes = 48.0% versus Continue E-cigarettes = 42.4%; OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.84, 1.85) nor the NRT-by-treatment recommendation interaction were significant. The direction and magnitude of main effects for 30-day PPA at week 12 were similar to 7-day PPA, but the NRT-by-treatment recommendation interaction was significant (p = .04): smoking cessation was greatest for the NRT plus Quit E-cigarettes condition (47.1%) versus NRT plus Continue E-cigarettes (28.1%); No NRT plus Quit E-cigarettes (29.2%); and No NRT plus Continue E-cigarettes (30.4%) conditions (all p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: NRT is effective in promoting early smoking cessation among young adult dual users. Secondary findings indicate that pairing NRT with support to quit both products could enhance the effects on prolonged cigarette abstinence.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Because validated measures of this experience are lacking, this study aimed to develop and validate scales measuring uncontrolled vaping and vaping restraint among US adults and youth. METHODS: We developed new survey measures of uncontrolled vaping and vaping restraint based on qualitative research and refined them after cognitive interviews. In Study 1, we used data from a convenience sample of 950 US adult e-cigarette users to establish psychometrically sound scales. In Study 2, we used data from a nationally representative sample of 1,138 US adolescents and adults to finalize the scales. RESULTS: Study 1 produced reliable scales for uncontrolled vaping perception (five items), uncontrolled vaping consequences (four items), and vaping restraint (four items) (αs = .87-.93). Convergent and criterion validity were demonstrated by stronger associations of uncontrolled vaping with use behaviors (median r = .65 vs. .39) and somewhat weaker associations with measures of limiting use (median r = .44 vs. .51). Higher vaping restraint scores were associated with measures of limiting use (r = .46 to .59) and quit intentions (r = .23 to .48). Study 2 confirmed these results and further refined the scales to three items each. CONCLUSION: The newly developed scales for uncontrolled vaping and vaping restraint demonstrated sound psychometric properties in both convenience and nationally representative samples. These measures can inform e-cigarette regulatory actions and guide the development of vaping management and cessation approaches. IMPLICATIONS: This study introduces reliable and valid scales to measure uncontrolled vaping perceptions, uncontrolled vaping consequences, and vaping restraint among e-cigarette users. These tools provide a nuanced understanding of vaping behaviors, distinguishing internal perceptions of overuse from external consequences such as feedback from others or interference with daily activities. By capturing these dimensions, the scales offer insights beyond traditional nicotine dependence measures, supporting research and interventions tailored to vaping-specific challenges. The findings highlight the importance of addressing uncontrolled vaping through regulatory and clinical efforts, informing strategies to reduce excessive vaping, and promoting self-regulation among e-cigarette users.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The aim of this study is to describe individuals who currently and formerly used HTPs, including the association between HTP use and perceived relative harm of HTPs to combustible cigarettes (CCs), and CC cessation among an online SA population. METHODS: Data were obtained from an online survey conducted in 2021 among SA adults ≥18 years (n = 12 674). The dependent variables were HTP-use status, past-year quit attempts and cigarettes-per-day (CPD). Primary independent variables were CC-smoking status and relative harm perceptions. Weighted proportions, multivariable logistic, and Poisson regression models were used to examine the association between dependent and independent variables. RESULTS: In this online sample, 2.82% of SA adults indicated current HTP-use. Among current CC-smokers, 6.57% indicated current HTP-use compared to 0.50% among those who have never smoked cigarettes. Current CC-smoking was associated with higher odds of current HTP-use (aOR = 2.66; 95% CI = 1.11 to 6.39). Conversely, perceiving HTPs as more/equally harmful than CCs was associated with lower odds of current HTP-use (aOR = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.14 to 0.40). HTP-use was not associated with previous CC quit attempts, and there was no difference in CPD between current and never HTPs users who smoked (aIRR = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.14). CONCLUSIONS: HTP users in the studied SA online population were mostly current cigarette smokers who believed HTPs were less harmful than cigarettes. However, HTP-use was not associated with higher previous quit attempts nor smoking fewer CPD. IMPLICATIONS: This study provides early data on the behaviors and beliefs associated with HTPs in SA, a significant yet understudied tobacco market for novel nicotine products. It reveals that individuals with lower harm perceptions, polytobacco use, and individuals who currently smoke CCs are more likely to consume HTPs. However, HTP use was not associated with higher odds of past-year cigarette quit attempts or a reduction in the number of CPD. These findings offer valuable evidence for surveillance and policy efforts aimed at emerging tobacco products and protecting public health.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Stealth vaping, that is, discrete use in places where it is prohibited, is also reported to be increasing. Regular vape use is high among those who identify as Māori, with the Tobacco Industry reported to be targeting Indigenous communities, thus continuing long-running harmful, colonial practices. AIMS AND METHODS: This qualitative study, using group interviews within a kaupapa Māori framework, explored stealth vaping with 19 young adults, of whom 18 identified as Māori in the Indigenous context in New Zealand. RESULTS: The results showed that hiding vape use is enhanced by the features of devices, while the nicotine content drives the need to vape nearly anywhere. CONCLUSIONS: The tobacco and nicotine endgame approach is favored by Māori leaders, meaning stricter regulation on vaping devices alone does not adequately protect young people. Instead, stronger measures must be implemented to reduce the appeal of vaping. Vaping does not align with Māori worldviews. Addiction and their easy concealment sustain their use, highlighting the tension between alternative nicotine products that benefit the Tobacco Industry, with the goals of Māori and other Indigenous peoples to eradicate nicotine entirely. IMPLICATIONS: The study results reinforce that priority must be given to culturally led and culturally safe regulatory and policy changes and advocacy for both smoke- and vape-free environments. Regulating the features of devices to negate their stealth use, as their invisibility was facilitated by their manipulability, should enable the existing smoke-free environment spaces to again deter vape use. Advocates must understand Māori history and context to extend the spaces where the strength that comes from being Māori will overcome the need to vape.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We examined attention to and unaided recall of culturally targeted (CT) tobacco education among LGBTQ+ YA in an experimental trial. METHODS: LGBTQ+ YA reporting current nicotine or tobacco (N/T) use completed a baseline survey, eye tracking experiment (viewing 8 CT or non-targeted stimuli), and post-survey. Areas of interest (AOIs) were harms message, efficacy message, and image. We compared dwell time (DT) and fixation duration (FD) to AOIs by condition and modeled associations between DT/FD and message relevance and perceived message effectiveness (PME). One-week post-exposure, participants completed open-ended items assessing unaided recall (memory of stimuli ). We coded responses using a data-driven inductive approach. RESULTS: There was no difference in DT/FD to AOIs by condition. Attention to harms AOIs was positively associated with message relevance (DT: Beta = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.17; FD: Beta = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.58) and PME (DT: Beta = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.04-0.15). Attention to image AOIs was associated with increased message relevance. Participants across conditions positively recalled sociodemographic diversity in images. Experimental participants resonated with LGBTQ+ representation, while control participants recalled racial and age diversity. Participants recalled messages highlighting tobacco industry targeting and long-term health harms. Participants expressed interest in quitting or reducing N/T use. CONCLUSION: LGBTQ+ YA find CT tobacco public education memorable; however, non-targeted campaigns featuring diverse models are also effective at fostering visual attention and recall. IMPLICATIONS: This study assessed how cultural targeting affects visual attention, perceptions, and unaided recall of tobacco public education among LGBTQ+ YA who use nicotine and tobacco. . Regardless of condition, LGBTQ+ YA recalled stimuli featuring diverse visual representation (e.g., sexual orientation, race) and messages about tobacco industry manipulation of minoritized communities. Visual attention to imagery and harms messages increased message relevance and perceived message effectiveness (harms messages only). Most participants qualitatively expressed intentions to quit or reduce use post-exposure. Tobacco public education integrating CT content, representative models, and counter-industry marketing may engage LGBTQ+ YA and motivate behavior change in this population.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Improving early treatment response is critical for Black adults who smoke (AWS) who bear a disproportionate share of tobacco-related mortality. METHODS: Secondary data analysis of a randomized clinical trial among Black AWS (N = 392) interested in quitting smoking. Participants received 18 weeks of pharmacotherapy and smoking cessation counseling. This investigation quantified the proportion of participants who never achieved 24-hour abstinence through week 2 (W2). Best subsets logistic regression identified baseline and non-baseline factors contributing to never achieving 24-hour abstinence. RESULTS: 135 participants (36.2%) did not achieve 24-hour abstinence by W2 despite good adherence with nicotine patch (73.9% had > 80% compliance). Of those, 56.4% and 47.8% still did not achieve 24-hour abstinence at W6 and W12, respectively. Baseline financial strain, higher baseline cotinine and smoking more CPD at W2 increased odds of never achieving 24-hour abstinence while greater cessation self-efficacy and more positive beliefs about study medication at W2 decreased odds of never achieving 24-hours abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of individuals who were motivated to quit smoking and received gold-standard treatment (i.e., pharmacotherapy and counseling) never achieved a period of 24 hours of abstinence. Findings highlight financial strain, nicotine dependence, early self-efficacy challenges, and medication experience as targets for improving abstinence among those at high risk for early treatment failure. By characterizing a subset within a larger population at-risk of continued smoking, the study presents opportunities to consider contributors to treatment success. IMPLICATIONS: Individuals who do not experience success with quitting early in treatment rarely go on to achieve long-term abstinence, yet the majority of interventions fail to address challenges among this high-risk subgroup. Findings suggest a need for interventions that consider the psychological impact of unmet social needs associated with financial strain, address low cessation self-efficacy, and early experiences with smoking cessation pharmacotherapy as approaches for bolstering treatment efficacy. Two possible evidence-based interventions for addressing these factors are discussed.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

California's statewide law prohibiting sales of flavored tobacco products went into effect on December 21, 2022. It is unknown whether California college students are aware of this law. AIMS AND METHODS: An online survey of California college students (ages 18-24) was conducted from April 4 to August 6, 2024 (n = 3919). Mixed models estimated associations between awareness of the state law and any tobacco product use (including nicotine vapes, cigarettes, cigars, hookah, and nicotine pouches), adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, only 20.8% of students were aware of the state law. Awareness differed by any tobacco use: 16.1% among never, 23.3% among ever (not current), and 24.4% among current. Compared to students who never used tobacco, students who reported ever use were more likely to be aware (aOR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.90), as were those who reported current use (aOR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.24, 1.87). Among students who reported current use, those who used flavored tobacco were less likely to be aware compared to those who used unflavored tobacco (23.3% vs. 31.6%; aOR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.42, 0.83). CONCLUSIONS: More than 15 months after California prohibited flavored tobacco sales, only one in five college students was aware of the law. Surprisingly, awareness was lower among students who used flavored tobacco than those who used unflavored tobacco. Students who use unflavored tobacco may have greater awareness as a result of challenges with purchasing flavored tobacco. IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study to examine awareness of California's law prohibiting sales of flavored tobacco among young adults (ages 18-24). Only 20.8% of California college students were aware of the law. Notably, awareness was lower among students who reported current use of flavored tobacco compared to those who reported current use of unflavored tobacco. Some students may have faced difficulties purchasing flavored tobacco, which raised their awareness of the law. These results suggest the need for public health campaigns and retail signage to improve awareness of the law, particularly among young adults.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: We used data from an observational study of 371 adults who smoked cigarettes daily, some of whom also used e-cigarettes, and who were followed every two months for up to two years (Wisconsin, US, 2015-19). Using a multistate transition model, we assessed continuous associations between transition propensities and urinary tobacco biomarker concentrations, namely 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol) (NNAL) and NE-2 (cotinine + trans-3'-hydroxycotinine), the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR; trans-3'-hydroxycotinine:cotinine), and NNAL:NE-2, measured every 4 months. RESULTS: The biomarkers were generally more predictive of transitions from dual use, but not from cigarette-only use, than self-reported product use was. Propensity to stop smoking cigarettes decreased with increasing concentrations of NNAL and NE-2, for both participants who smoked only cigarettes and those who used both cigarettes and e-cigarettes. For example, we estimated that, at 20 pg NNAL per mg creatinine, 30.2% (95%CI, 14.6%, 47.0%) of those who only smoke cigarettes and 26.6% (95% CI, 11.3%, 42.5%) who dual use would transition to non-current cigarette use and e-cigarette use in one year, while at the 200 pg/ng, we estimate these probabilities to be 3.2% (95%CI, 1.7%, 5.8%) and 3.9% (95% CI, 1.9%, 8.5%), respectively. The ratio NNAL:NE-2 was predictive of transitions from dual use to cigarette-only (higher ratio) or e-cigarette-only (lower ratio) use. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary tobacco biomarkers were non-linearly associated with transitions in tobacco product use and may guide the development of clinical interventions to promote harm-reducing product use transitions.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Most research on e-cigarette product placement has been content analyses of music videos. We explored the motivations, activities, and results of product placement activities of the e-cigarette company Ploom and its successors, Pax Labs and Juul Labs, in music videos as well as film and television. METHODS: Case study using internal industry documents released in litigation and housed at the UCSF Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library. Relevant documents were cataloged, summarized, and placed in chronological order. RESULTS: We identified 451 relevant documents. Ploom sought product placements to expand its audience and enhance credibility. After Ploom split into Pax Labs and Juul Labs, they pursued free product placements by establishing relationships with prop masters in the entertainment industry and loaning devices to media productions using a placement agency. Later, Pax devices secured placements in music videos, film, and television; Juul appeared to secure only one placement. CONCLUSIONS: Ploom and its successor companies secured free product placements in music videos, films, and television. Pax devices associated with cannabis were placed more frequently than Juul. Given that tobacco advertising causes youth initiation, stronger regulation of product placement practices may be warranted. IMPLICATIONS: Ploom, Pax Labs, and Juul Labs used entertainment industry firms and outreach to prop masters to obtain free numerous product placements as consumers in general increasingly ignore or avoid traditional advertising. Product placements, which can improve brand recall, are better liked than commercials, and contribute to youth smoking uptake, appeared in popular and culturally relevant movies, shows, and music videos. E-cigarette industry product placement practices reflected those successfully used by major tobacco companies in the past.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We assessed public support for the Control of Smoking Products for Public Health Act 2024(Act 852). METHODS: An online survey was conducted among 1000 adult Malaysians using the Global Adult Tobacco Survey questionnaire. Support for laws under Act 852; smoke-free environments, advertising, promotion, and sponsorship; tobacco packaging and labeling, sales restrictions, etc., cover conventional cigarettes and nicotine products, was measured on a five-point Likert scale. Support was compared between individuals who smoke tobacco and use nicotine products and those who do not use these products. RESULTS: The mean age was 38.7 years (SD=11.5), 60% were Malays, 49.4% were private employees, and 48.5% were educated to a bachelor's/higher degree. The respondents showed a high (>80%) level of public support for all laws. The highest support was for a ban on sales to minors (91.6%), a smoking ban in various public spaces (91.5%), and prohibiting sales via vending machines and places closer to higher education institutes (90.9%). Support was significantly higher among those who do not smoke and use nicotine products. Higher age and education, higher knowledge of the harms of smoking, and smoke-free policy at home were associated with higher support; current tobacco/nicotine product use and exposure to tobacco advertisements were associated with lower support. CONCLUSION: A strong public support for Act 852 that covers both tobacco and nicotine products augurs well for their strict implementation to achieve Malaysia's tobacco endgame of reducing smoking prevalence to <5% by 2040.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Since then, snus brands and test markets have proliferated. METHODS: This article assesses consumer response by analyzing data from the 2006 and 2007 Indiana Adult Tobacco Survey (IATS), a statewide telephone survey of 3,544 adults. During those years, the IATS included questions on awareness and trial of Camel Snus and Taboka. Analyses examined rates and predictors of awareness and trial statewide, and within the central Indiana test market. RESULTS: Nineteen percent of Indiana adults were aware of either Taboka or Camel Snus in 2006 and 2007. Estimates are larger (29%) for central Indiana and larger still (70%) for central Indiana smokers. Trial of snus, however, was very low (1.5% statewide), except among male smokers in central Indiana, 20% of whom are estimated to have tried it. Multivariate analyses showed that trial was more likely among men than women (odds ratio [OR] 13.85), residents of central Indiana than those farther from Indianapolis (OR 2.96), recipients than nonrecipients of tobacco promotions (OR 6.08), and those believing that smokeless tobacco is less harmful than cigarettes compared with those who believe it is equally or more harmful (OR 3.86). DISCUSSION: Results from this study suggest substantial initial interest in the new products among male smokers in this test market, especially those who receive promotional mailings from tobacco companies, which often include coupons for free or discounted products.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

METHODS: The Behavioral Ecological Model (BEM) assumes interlocking social contingencies of reinforcement (i.e., rewards or punishments) from the highest level of society (e.g., taxing cigarette sales) to physiological reactions to nicotine that influence smoking and SHSe. We review selected research concerning both policy and clinical efforts to restrict smoking and/or SHSe. RESULTS: Research to date has focused on smoking cessation with modest to weak effects. The BEM and empirical evidence suggest that cultural contingencies of reinforcement should be emphasized to protect people from SHSe, especially vulnerable children, pregnant women, the ill, the elderly, and low-income adults who have not ""elected"" to smoke. Doing so will protect vulnerable populations from industry-produced SHSe and may yield more and longer-lasting cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that reduce SHSe may serve as a Trojan horse to counter the tobacco industry. Future studies should: (a) guide policies to restrict SHSe; (b) develop powerful community and clinical interventions to reduce SHSe; (c) test the degree to which policies and other contexts enhance the effects of clinical interventions (e.g., media programs disclosing the disingenuous marketing by the industry); and (d) investigate the effects of all health care providers' ability to reduce SHSe and generate an antitobacco culture, by advising all clients to avoid starting to smoke, to protect their children from SHSe, and to quit smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, the circumstances under which these policies altered the smoking landscape have changed and are likely to change further. As well, decreases in smoking prevalence may have ""stalled"" at current levels. Because today's smokers differ significantly from yesterday's and the environment in which smokers consume their cigarettes has changed, it is plausible that several of the evidence-based tobacco control policies soon will have run their course in the most advanced tobacco control environments. We ask, therefore, what developed nations can expect of these policies in the future and what novel policy measures may be needed to continue the assault on tobacco. DISCUSSION: After summarizing tobacco control success in the United States and the findings from tobacco control policy research, we consider the remaining problem focusing on the characteristics of remaining smokers and their circumstances. We then examine constraints on the continuing effectiveness of evidence-based policy interventions. We employ a model to project U.S. smoking prevalence decades into the future, with and without improvements in initiation and cessation rates. We then speculate about novel policy directions that will be needed to further move the needle of tobacco control. CONCLUSION: Without substantial innovation in tobacco control policy, further reductions in smoking in developed nations will come frustratingly slowly. Needed policy innovations might be quite radical, such as legislating entirely smoke-free outdoor environments or regulators reducing allowable nicotine in cigarettes to non-addicting levels.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The tobacco industry has conducted extensive research on the chemosensory and physiological effects of menthol in tobacco smoke and has actively promoted menthol's sensory characteristics. Based upon previously published examinations of internal tobacco industry documents, this commentary summarizes what is currently known about the tobacco industry's use of menthol to modify sensory characteristics in cigarettes and the implications of these activities for smoking behavior. The industry considers menthol to be an important tool for modulating the sensory effects of nicotine in different product variations, particularly those designed to be acceptable to ""starters"" or people interested in quitting. Regulatory efforts should consider that menthol enables the tobacco industry to customize a highly addictive product in a manner that contributes to initiation and deters cessation due to its chemosensory effects.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The goal is to discuss some research directions related to establishing tobacco product standards under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which empowers the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products. Potential research related to tobacco product ingredients, nicotine, and harmful or potentially harmful constituents of tobacco products is discussed. DISCUSSION: Ingredients, which are additives, require less attention than nicotine and harmful or potentially harmful constituents. With respect to nicotine, the threshold level in tobacco products below which dependent users will be able to freely stop using the product if they choose to do so is a very important question. Harmful and potentially harmful constituents include various toxicants and carcinogens. An updated list of 72 carcinogens in cigarette smoke is presented. A crucial question is the appropriate levels of toxicants and carcinogens in tobacco products. The use of carcinogen and toxicant biomarkers to determine these levels is discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The need to establish regulatory standards for added ingredients, nicotine, and other tobacco and tobacco smoke constituents leads to many interesting and potentially highly significant research questions, which urgently need to be addressed.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Reynolds Tobacco Company is marketing Camel Snus as a product for nontobacco users, smokeless-tobacco users, or cigarette smokers. The objective of this study was to examine advertisements of Camel Snus in print media to determine the most likely audience of intent. METHODS: A content analysis was conducted among Camel Snus advertisements printed in newspaper and consumer magazines between July 2007 and August 2010. The advertisements (n = 83 distinct; N = 458 total) were identified from a comprehensive search of a proprietary database maintained by TNS Media Intelligence. RESULTS: Results indicated that all advertisements, published between July 2007 and September 2009, were intended to promote a tobacco product for cigarette smokers. A shift in marketing strategy occurred from October 2009 to the present time with publication of the ""Break Free"" magazine advertisements, characterized by an ambiguous message that could conceivably appeal to any group, including nontobacco users (e.g., adolescents), smokeless-tobacco users, and/or cigarette smokers. However, an examination of the consumer magazines advertising Camel Snus indicated a demographically diverse readership in terms of gender, age, and education, suggesting that the advertisements are less likely to be intended for smokeless-tobacco users. CONCLUSIONS: These findings validate other reports and editorials, suggesting that Camel Snus was being marketed as a product for smokers at the time of the product's national debut. The recent shift to the ""Break Free"" marketing campaign may reflect an attempt to enhance the image of the Camel brand in order to attract a broader spectrum of consumers.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Lesbian and gay bars as an underutilized venue for tobacco interventions.,"INTRODUCTION: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities are at high risk for tobacco use. While LGBT communities have historically considered bars to be safe places to socialize and congregate, these spaces are often tobacco-friendly environments and may have potential as sites for much needed intervention. INTERVENTIONS IN BARS: Only a few public health interventions have attempted to work through bars and clubs to decrease tobacco use in the LGBT populations. Evidence from HIV prevention suggests some potential interventions in bars, and the tobacco industry has worked extensively (and successfully) to utilize bars in marketing efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Lesbian and gay bars are underutilized in tobacco control, suggesting missed avenues for chronic disease prevention programs. Researchers and communities should continue to recognize the importance of clean indoor air laws covering bars and develop additional strategies for reaching LGBT populations with disparities.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Analysis of major tobacco industries' internal secret documents on cigarette radioactivity made available online by the Master Settlement Agreement in 1998. RESULTS: The documents show that the industry was well aware of the presence of a radioactive substance in tobacco as early as 1959. Furthermore, the industry was not only cognizant of the potential ""cancerous growth"" in the lungs of regular smokers but also did quantitative radiobiological calculations to estimate the long-term (25 years) lung radiation absorption dose (rad) of ionizing alpha particles emitted from the cigarette smoke. Our own calculations of lung rad of alpha particles match closely the rad estimated by the industry. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the industry's and our estimate of long-term lung rad of alpha particles causes 120-138 lung cancer deaths per year per 1,000 regular smokers. Acid wash was discovered in 1980 to be highly effectively in removing (210)Po from the tobacco leaves; however, the industry avoided its use for concerns that acid media would ionize nicotine converting it into a poorly absorbable form into the brain of smokers thus depriving them of the much sought after instant ""nicotine kick"" sensation. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence of lung cancer risk caused by cigarette smoke radioactivity is compelling enough to warrant its removal.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Public health professionals need to understand young adults' risks perceptions about and use of new tobacco products to best inform tobacco control interventions. METHODS: In 2009, researchers conducted 8 focus groups with 67 young adults stratified by self-reported tobacco use and nonuse, residence in rural and urban areas, and living in a state with or without a statewide smoking restriction policy. Participants provided feedback about their knowledge and risk perceptions about and use of tobacco products and marketing. RESULTS: Participants reported a high level of familiarity with a wide range of novel tobacco products. A great deal of confusion and disagreement appeared with regard to absolute and relative risk of different tobacco products. Participants readily discussed using smokeless tobacco products as alternatives to smoking when smoking is prohibited. Fewer differences in tobacco-related knowledge risk perceptions and use were found between urban and rural participants and those in smoke-free policy and nonpolicy states than between user and nonuser groups. Both users and nonusers were familiar with and skeptical about tobacco marketing and prevention efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults are familiar with many tobacco products, but they convey little understanding of relative risks of new or trendy tobacco products, such as snus or hookah. Mindful of industry innovation, tobacco control advocates must continuously update prevention efforts, seeking new strategies to limit promotion, marketing, and use of new and conventional products.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The objective of this study was to examine the trends in use and advertising of discount versus premium snuff since the Conwood settlement, a topic seldom addressed in the tobacco control literature. METHODS: 2 sources of data were analyzed in 2011: (a) male snuff users from the 2002-2009 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (N = 13,172) and (b) total advertisements of moist snuff identified from over 350 consumer magazines dated 2005-2009 (N = 861). For the survey data, demographic and tobacco-related measures were assessed as predictors of use of discount versus premium snuff in logistic regression models. For the advertising data, associations were examined between the snuff category and nicotine content, magazine youth readership, and year of magazine publication. RESULTS: The prevalence of discount and premium snuff use among males increased and decreased, respectively, from 2002 to 2009. Significant predictors of using discount versus premium snuff were being an adolescent, being an African-American, being a current or former smoker, living in a less populated region of the country, and using snuff frequently. Discount snuff advertising was associated with publication in magazines with a high youth readership. CONCLUSIONS: Discount snuff has grown in popularity among male adolescents who have been a target of advertising. The tobacco's cheap price and high nicotine content pose a public health problem because of the potential for long-term tobacco use and dependence.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

A key area to explore relates to the potential regulation of nicotine content in cigarettes. Determining the nicotine content per cigarette below which smokers reliably reduce their consumption of and dependence on cigarettes, an idea proposed almost 20 years ago (Benowitz & Henningfield, 1994), could be a powerful approach to reduce the abuse liability and consequent harm from cigarettes. However, this approach is laden with potentially complex issues. Many of these complications can be studied using animal models, but they require a particular perspective. METHODS: Herein, we review several challenges for animal researchers interested in nicotine reduction as examples of how this perspective dictates new approaches to animal research. These include defining the threshold nicotine dose for maintaining self-administration, evaluating the differential impact of various implementation strategies, assessing the factors that could interact with nicotine to alter the reinforcement threshold, describing the role of cues in maintaining low dose nicotine self-administration, and examining individual differences in response to nicotine reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers who study tobacco using animal models have the opportunity to play a central role in the regulatory science of tobacco and conduct studies that directly inform policy decisions that could impact the lives of millions.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This paper focuses on issues affecting Articles 9 and 10 of the FCTC. This paper focuses on the research that is most important for most countries, rather than on what is desirable in countries with high levels of research capacity. Articles 9 and 10 of the FCTC address the regulation of contents and emissions of tobacco products and regulation of tobacco product disclosure. Such regulation will be essential if the long-term objective of reducing the danger of tobacco products is to be achieved. There are many components of tobacco and tobacco smoke that are excessively toxic and dangerous to the user. Many of these components are carcinogenic and addictive and can be removed or reduced substantially with current known technology. The fact that these components remain in tobacco and tobacco smoke at levels that are unnecessarily dangerous is precisely the reason why the successful implementation of Articles 9 and 10 of the FCTC is important to tobacco control. This paper discusses the scientific challenges involved in successfully implementing Articles 9 and 10 of the FCTC, which focuses on regulating carcinogens and toxins in tobacco and tobacco smoke, the abuse liability of tobacco products, and the additives and engineering features in tobacco products that make tobacco products appealing to future consumers. The research issues we focus on are those required to support the early stages of regulation.

Snus, a smokeless tobacco product with lower levels of most tobacco-related toxicants than cigarette smoke, has been recently introduced in the United States. The objective of this study was to evaluate the mouth-level exposure (MLE) to selected tobacco constituents from snus by adult consumers of Camel SNUS (CSNUS). METHODS: For 7 days, 53 adult CSNUS consumers used their usual brand styles ad libitum, collecting their snus pouches after use. The collected pouches and unused product were analyzed for nicotine, N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), N'-nitrosoanabasine (NAB), N'-nitrosoanatabine (NAT), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and nickel. MLE was estimated using the difference between the constituent amounts in the used and unused snus products. RESULTS: CSNUS consumption averaged 3.3 pouches/day or approximately 1.98 g/day. Mean nicotine MLE was 2.8 mg/pouch or 9.4 mg/day. Mean MLE to total tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs: NNK, NNN, NAB, and NAT) was 171.5 ng/pouch or 527.7 ng/day. B[a]P MLE averaged 0.2 ng/pouch or 0.68 ng/day. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report snus MLE under normal conditions of use in a group of adult, U.S. snus consumers. On average, approximately 60%-90% of the amounts of nicotine, TSNAs, and B[a]P initially present in a snus pouch remained in the pouch after use by snus consumers in this study. The results from this study provide a preliminary assessment of exposure to constituents present in snus, which is potentially useful in risk assessment.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Therefore, for the global tobacco control community to make informed decisions that will continue to effectively inform policy implementation, it is critical that the tobacco control community, policy makers, and funders have updated information on the state of the science as it pertains to provisions of the FCTC. Following the National Cancer Institute's process model used in identifying the research needs of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's relatively new tobacco law, a core team of scientists from the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco identified and commissioned internationally recognized scientific experts on the topics covered within the FCTC. These experts analyzed the relevant sections of the FCTC and identified critical gaps in research that is needed to inform policy and practice requirements of the FCTC. This paper summarizes the process and the common themes from the experts' recommendations about the research and related infrastructural needs. Research priorities in common across Articles include improving surveillance, fostering research communication/collaboration across organizations and across countries, and tracking tobacco industry activities. In addition, expanding research relevant to low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), was also identified as a priority, including identification of what existing research findings are transferable, what new country-specific data are needed, and the infrastructure needed to implement and disseminate research so as to inform policy in LMIC.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Qualitative study using semistructured interviews with 20 key stakeholders (7 academic experts in tobacco control, 5 representatives of 3 pharmaceutical companies, and 8 representatives of organizations involved in tobacco-control policy making) and documentary analysis. RESULTS: Four main themes were identified. In general, currently available nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) were considered to be relatively unsuccessful as substitutes because they deliver insufficient nicotine too slowly. Stronger, faster-acting nicotine products were deemed necessary. However, issues were raised about how smokers may perceive stronger, faster-acting products linked to misunderstandings about nicotine. Pharmaceutical companies have shown reluctance to pursue NRT development; discussions around harm reduction are shifting company attitudes, although concerns remain about the impact of developing more addictive products on company image and whether such products would be problematic to license. The greater cost of producing an NCP within the medical regulatory regime, compared with cigarettes, was underlined. Recreational NCPs were considered problematic as they do not currently need to meet the high regulatory standards required for medications. CONCLUSIONS: Although experts generally agreed that NRT development ought to focus on stronger and faster-acting products, questions were raised over whether this aligns with smokers' understandings and requirements. A more nuanced grasp of how smokers understand harm-reduction approaches and products is required. Pharmaceutical companies may not be best placed to innovate, indicating that the market may well be left to other actors including the tobacco industry.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

To inform these efforts, we sought to better understand how smokers and nonsmokers think about tobacco constituents. METHODS: In October 2012, 300 U.S. adults aged 18-66 years completed a cross-sectional Internet survey. The questions focused on 20 harmful tobacco constituents that the FDA has prioritized for communicating with the public. RESULTS: Most participants had heard of 7 tobacco constituents (ammonia, arsenic, benzene, cadmium, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, and nicotine), but few participants had heard of the others (e.g., acrolein). Few participants correctly understood that many constituents were naturally present in tobacco. Substances that companies add to cigarette tobacco discouraged people from wanting to smoke more than substances that naturally occur in cigarette smoke (p < .001). Ammonia, arsenic, carbon monoxide, and formaldehyde being in cigarettes elicited the most discouragement from smoking. Constituents elicited greater discouragement from wanting to smoke if respondents were nonsmokers (β = -.34, p < .05), had negative images of smokers (i.e., negative smoker prototypes; β = .19, p < .05), believed constituents are added to tobacco (β = .14, p < .05), or were older (β = .16, p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study found low awareness of most tobacco constituents, with greater concern elicited by additives. Efforts to communicate health risks of tobacco constituents should consider focusing on ones that elicited the most discouragement from smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, little is known about how NCPs are advertised and to whom. METHODS: Two full-service advertising firms were used to systematically collect all U.S. advertisements for NCPs (e-cigarettes, snus, dissolvables, and chew/dip/snuff,) running between June 1 and September 1, 2012. The advertisement and associated metadata (brand, media channel, observations, spend, and estimated reach) were examined. Attributes of print advertisements were examined relative to target demographics of the publications in which they ran. RESULTS: Over 3 months, almost $20 million was spent advertising NCPs. Although the greatest amount spent was on the promotion of smokeless (~$8 million) and snus (~$10 million), e-cigarette advertisements were the most widely circulated. Print advertisements, the majority of which were e-cigarettes and chew/dip/snuff, were heavily tailored to middle-aged White males. Many e-cigarette print ads suggested harm reduction and use when one cannot smoke (poly-use), while chew/dip/snuff focused on masculinity. CONCLUSIONS: Robust ongoing surveillance of NCP advertising is critical to inform the FDA and to protect public health. Both commercial advertising and public health media campaigns must ensure that content is not misleading and that it educates consumers about harm based on the available science. The way messages are framed have the potential to decrease tobacco use by promoting rather than undermining cessation of combusted products and/or by encouraging exclusive use of less harmful NCPs rather than poly-use of combusted and NCPs.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We tested this assertion using data reported by the manufacturers. METHODS: Data were collected from the annual reports filed with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health by 4 major manufacturers of cigarettes from 1997 to 2012. Reportable measures included nicotine yield (mg/cig) in smoke generated by a smoking machine based on the Massachusetts smoking regimen and nicotine content in the unburned tobacco per cigarette (mg/cig). We used multilevel linear mixed-effect models to examine temporal trends in and predictors of these measures, overall and by brand style and by brand family. RESULTS: While nicotine content remained relatively stable in the range of 12-14 mg/cig between 1998 and 2012, average nicotine yield increased significantly (p < .01) over time and ranged from the lowest level of 1.65 mg/cigarette in 1999 to the highest level of 1.89 mg/cigarette in 2011. Nicotine yield and yield-to-content ratio varied significantly among manufacturers and brand families. When controlling for market category and all available design features, the yield-to-content ratio of all manufacturers except Lorillard increased significantly over time. CONCLUSIONS: The data provided by tobacco manufacturers suggest that the increasing trend in yield is not related to variations in nicotine content but to the yield-to-content ratio, which contradicts their assertions of agricultural variations. Nicotine yield and yield-to-content ratio are controllable features of cigarettes, and they should be monitored and regulated by government agencies.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,No,

This descriptive study assessed changes in e-cigarette availability and promotions among retailers in 11 college communities in North Carolina and Virginia during a 1-year period. METHODS: During the spring of 2012 and 2013, observers completed assessments in 320 tobacco-selling retailers, including grocery and convenience stores, pharmacies, and tobacco shops. Assessors collected e-cigarette availability, advertising, price, and promotions. RESULTS: E-cigarette availability increased among retailers from 24.7% in 2012 to 59.9% in 2013. They were available in the form of disposables and reusable kits and were most frequently available in tobacco shops, convenience stores, and pharmacies. The average price for disposables was $9.70 (SD = 1.07) in 2012 and $9.61 (SD = 2.10) in 2013; the average price for kits was $39.58 (SD = 15.79) in 2012 and $32.59 (SD = 18.65) in 2013. The presence of interior advertising increased from 12.7% to 50.6% (p < .0001), and the presence of exterior advertising increased from 7.6% to 22.8% (p = .0002). Convenience stores with gas (16.4%-70.4%; p < .0001) and without gas (6.0%-48.4%; p < .0001) had significant increases in the presence of interior advertising. Convenience stores with gas also had a significant increase in the presence of exterior advertising (8.2%-33.3%; p < .0001). Only 3% of retailers offered price promotions. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of e-cigarettes, including rechargeable kits and disposables, more than doubled during the study. The presence of interior and exterior advertising also significantly increased. Results underscore the need for further surveillance to understand how these environmental characteristics impact individual exposure and use of e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Participants were randomized into 1 of 4 groups (continued smoking, switched to consuming Orbs, switched to dual use of cigarettes and Orbs, and tobacco abstinent) and confined for 6 days with dietary restrictions. Most measurements were at baseline and days 1, 3, and 5 of intervention. Mouth-level tar and nicotine exposures were estimated by filter tip analysis. Twenty biomarkers were quantified in 24-hr urine; 4 were quantified in blood/plasma (carboxyhemoglobin, nicotine, cotinine, and thiocyanate). Ratings for nicotine dependence and withdrawal symptoms were scored. RESULTS: After 5 days, substantial and statistically significant reductions (~30%-90%) in all biomarkers were observed in the Orbs and abstinent groups compared to baseline. Numerous smaller reductions (~7%-30%) were also noted in the continued smoking and dual-use groups (generally similar in magnitude for both groups). Subjective questionnaire findings indicated greater withdrawal discomfort levels throughout the intervention period for the nonsmoking groups. For subjects that continued smoking, clinical confinement conditions did not significantly alter product use behavior and toxicant exposure profile compared to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial reductions in toxicant exposure occurred for participants that did not smoke. Cigarette smokers that switched to Orbs use showed reductions in all biomarkers, similar to abstinent group. Changes in toxicant exposure for the dual-use group were similar to the continued-smoking group, consistent with minimal changes observed in that group's product use behavior (small reduction in cigarettes per day and small increase in Orbs use).","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: We assessed current cigarette smokers' use of e-cigarettes during the 30 days before admission to 9 hospitals in 5 geographically dispersed US cities: Birmingham, AL; Boston, MA; Kansas City, KS; New York, NY; and Portland, OR. Each hospital was conducting a randomized controlled trial as part of the NIH-sponsored Consortium of Hospitals Advancing Research on Tobacco (CHART). We conducted a pooled analysis using multiple logistic regression to examine changes in e-cigarette use over time and to identify correlates of e-cigarette use. RESULTS: Among 4,660 smokers hospitalized between July 2010 and December 2013 (mean age 57 years, 57% male, 71% white, 56% some college, average 14 cigarettes/day), 14% reported using an e-cigarette during the 30 days before admission. The prevalence of e-cigarette use increased from 1.1% in 2010 to 10.3% in 2011, 10.2% in 2012, and 18.4% in 2013; the increase was statistically significant (p < .0001) after adjustment for age, sex, education, and CHART study. Younger, better educated, and heavier smokers were more likely to use e-cigarettes. Smokers who were Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and who had Medicaid or no insurance were less likely to use e-cigarettes. E-cigarette use also varied by CHART project and by geographic region. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette use increased substantially from 2010 to 2013 among a large sample of hospitalized adult cigarette smokers. E-cigarette use was more common among heavier smokers and among those who were younger, white, and who had higher socioeconomic status.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

These devices deliver nicotine along with other constituents, including flavorants, via an inhalable aerosol. Their uptake is rapidly increasing in both adults and youths, primarily among current smokers. Public debate is increasing on how these devices should be regulated and used, yet only limited peer-reviewed research exists. To develop a informed policy for e-cigarettes, their effects on human behavior, physiology, and health need to be understood. PURPOSE: This paper describes proceedings from a National Institutes of Health-sponsored workshop, which was held in November 2013, to identify research needs related to the effects of e-cigarettes. Discussion topics included e-cigarette risks and abuse potential; the potential role for e-cigarettes in harm reduction and smoking cessation; unintended consequences of e-cigarette use, such as becoming a gateway to conventional cigarettes; and dual use of both e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The research needs identified by the workshop participants included the following: standards to measure the contents and emissions of e-cigarettes; biomarkers of exposure; physiological effects of e-cigarettes on tissues and organ systems, including pulmonary and cardiovascular; information on e-cigarette users, how the devices are used, and identification of the best tools to assess these measures; factors that drive use and influence patterns of use; and appropriate methods for evaluating a potential role for e-cigarettes in smoking or nicotine cessation. To understand fully the challenges and the opportunities that e-cigarettes represent, expertise will be needed in basic, behavioral, translational, and clinical sciences.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Guided by existing literature that demonstrates a relationship between normative beliefs and future intentions to use tobacco the current research sought to (1) develop a measure of normative beliefs about smokeless tobacco (ST) and establish the underlying factor structure, (2) evaluate the structure with confirmatory factor analysis utilizing an independent sample of youth, and (3) establish the measure's concurrent validity. METHODS: Respondents (smokers and nonsmokers aged 15-65; N = 2991) completed a web-based survey that included demographic characteristics, tobacco use history and dependence, and a measure of attitudes about ST adapted from the Normative Beliefs about Smoking scale. A second sample of youth (aged 14-17; N = 305) completed a similar questionnaire. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis produced the anticipated three-factor solution and accounted for nearly three-quarters of the variance in the data reflecting (1) perceived prevalence of ST use, (2) popularity of ST among successful/elite, and (3) approval of ST use by parents/peers. Confirmatory factor analysis with data from the youth sample demonstrated good model fit. Logistic regression demonstrated that the scales effectively discriminate between ST users and nonusers and are associated with interest in trying snus. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of MRTPs for regulatory purposes, which allows messages of reduced risk, should include measurement of social norms. Furthermore, surveillance efforts that track use of new MRTPs should include measures of social norms to determine how norms change with prevalence of use.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

We report an independent analysis of a consumer perception survey sponsored by Swedish Match as part of a Modified Risk Tobacco Product application to change warning labels for Swedish snus products. METHODS: The survey exposed each of 4324 daily exclusive cigarette smokers, 1033 daily smokeless tobacco users, 1205 daily other tobacco users, 726 former users, and 5915 triers/never users to one of four current warnings and two proposed relative-risk labels (No tobacco product is safe, but this product presents lower risks to health than cigarettes, or No tobacco product is safe, but this product presents substantially lower risks to health than cigarettes) for snus. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses examined four outcomes: believability, harmfulness, motivation to use, and intention to buy snus. RESULTS: Compared with the current not-safe-alternative warning, adult tobacco users who viewed the proposed labels perceived them as less believable, perceived snus as less harmful and were more likely to use and buy snus. The proposed labels had no impact on former smokers' likelihood to use and buy snus; triers/never users viewing the substantially lower risk label were more likely to buy snus. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco users viewing the proposed labels perceived snus as less harmful than cigarettes and may be more likely to use and buy snus. If labeling changes lead to increased snus use and cigarette reduction or abstinence, public health may benefit. If the opposite occurs, public health could suffer.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising is a common method used to promote tobacco products and may be a potential channel through which cigars are advertised. METHODS: Comperemedia (Mintel) was used to acquire opt-in direct mail and email advertising for the top 10 cigar brands in the United States between January 2013 and July 2014. The advertisement and corresponding data on brand, advertising spend, and mail volume were downloaded and summarized. Promotions such as coupons, giveaways, and sweepstakes were also examined. RESULTS: A total of 92 unique advertisements met the search criteria and included two brands: Black & Mild (n = 77) and Swisher Sweets (n = 15). Expenditures on direct mail advertising during this period totaled $12 809 630. Black & Mild encompassed 80% of total direct mail volume and 78% of direct mail advertising expenditures. Almost all advertisements contained at least one promotion (88%) and included a URL to the product website (85%). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Black & Mild and Swisher Sweets are the primary cigar brands using DTC advertising. Promotional offers were nearly ubiquitous among the advertisements, which may appeal to price-sensitive populations. Future studies should continue to examine cigar advertising via direct mail and email, in addition to other channels, such as the point-of-sale. IMPLICATIONS: Although cigar use and sales have increased in the United States over the past decade, there is limited data on cigar advertising.

We sought to understand US adults' awareness and use of DTPs. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of US adults (age ≥ 18 years, N = 17 522) completed an online survey in March 2013 assessing their awareness and use of DTPs. RESULTS: Approximately 16% of all respondents were aware of DTPs. Few reported ever using DTPs (1.6%). DTP awareness among all respondents was greatest among males, younger adults, current and former smokers, never married respondents, blacks and Latinos, and those who used other ATPs. Among current smokers, DTP awareness was greatest for males, younger adults, blacks and Latinos, those who used other ATPs, and Southerners. DTP use among all respondents was greatest among males, younger adults, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) respondents, former and current smokers, and those who used other ATPs. Among current smokers, DTP use was greatest among males, younger adults, LGBT respondents, those who used other ATPs, those who intended to quit, and those who received medical advice to quit. CONCLUSIONS: DTP awareness and use have increased since 2009. DTPs are being used as smoking cessation aids thereby increasing risk of polytobacco use. Medical professionals should emphasize use of empirically-supported smoking cessation aids when advising patients to quit. Regulations are needed to prevent tobacco company promotion of DTPs as smoking cessation aids and to inform consumers of the risks associated with DTPs and polytobacco use. Increased national surveillance of DTP use is recommended.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This conflict is made worse by an information vacuum that is being filled by vocal members on both sides of the debate; a perceived lack of credibility of public health officials by those in the vaping community; the tobacco industry's recent involvement in e-cigarettes; and the constant evolution of different styles and types of e-cigarettes. This conflict is avoidable; common ground exists. If both groups rally around what is in their own and the public's best interest-the end of combustible tobacco--all will benefit significantly. If not, the result may be missed opportunities, misguided alliances, and--ultimately-poorer public health. IMPLICATIONS: This study brings light to the contentious debate between the vaping and public health communities. It addresses how both sides are responsible for bringing misleading information to the public and vocal leaders on both sides are unknowingly intensifying and polarizing the debate-likely at the expense of public health. It also describes how this conflict is avoidable, and provides a starting point for potential positions of common ground against Big Tobacco.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Our study sought to obtain qualitative information on what people think about these constituents and the language they use to talk about them. METHODS: We conducted six focus groups in 2014 with 40 adults in North Carolina. Open-ended questions focused on cigarette and cigarette smoke constituents in general and on the 18 constituents on the FDA's abbreviated list. We coded the transcripts for emergent themes, and all four coders discussed themes until we reached consensus. RESULTS: Participants knew that cigarette smoke contains chemicals but did not know how many chemicals nor what those chemicals are, beyond tar and nicotine. Dangers of constituents mentioned included ""chemicals,"" physical disease, and addiction. Participants incorrectly believed harmful constituents came primarily from tobacco companies' additives. For unfamiliar constituents, people tried to make associations based on similar-sounding words. Recognizable constituents that participants associated with health harms most discouraged them from wanting to smoke. Most participants wanted to know health harms associated with constituents and what else the chemicals were in. CONCLUSIONS: Participants showed enthusiasm for learning more information about constituents, and also showed substantial misunderstandings about the source of harmful constituents. Our findings contribute to the limited body of research on adults' knowledge and perceptions of cigarette smoke constituents and can aid the FDA as it plans to disclose constituent information to the public. IMPLICATIONS: Our study provides information about adults' understanding of cigarette smoke constituents and what adults would like to know about these constituents. This information can help communication campaigns describe cigarette smoke constituents in a way that discourages people from wanting to smoke.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Other components, either naturally occurring in tobacco or additives that are intentionally added during the manufacturing process, may add to the addictiveness of tobacco products. As such, these components can make cigarette smokers more easily and heavily dependent.Efforts to regulate tobacco product dependence are emerging globally. Additives that increase tobacco dependence will be prohibited under the new European Tobacco Product Directive. OBJECTIVE: This article provides guidelines and recommendations for developing a regulatory strategy for assessment of increase in tobacco dependence due to additives. Relevant scientific literature is summarized and criteria and experimental studies that can define increased dependence of tobacco products are described. CONCLUSIONS: Natural tobacco smoke is a very complex matrix of components, therefore analysis of the contribution of an additive or a combination of additives to the level of dependence on this product is challenging. We propose to combine different type of studies analyzing overall tobacco product dependence potential and the functioning of additives in relation to nicotine. By using a combination of techniques, changes associated with nicotine dependence such as behavioral, physiological, and neurochemical alterations can be examined to provide sufficient information.Research needs and knowledge gaps will be discussed and recommendations will be made to translate current knowledge into legislation. As such, this article aids in implementation of the Tobacco Product Directive, as well as help enable regulators and researchers worldwide to develop standards to reduce dependence on tobacco products. IMPLICATIONS: This article provides an overall view on how to assess tobacco product constituents for their potential contribution to use and dependence. It provides guidelines that help enable regulators worldwide to develop standards to reduce dependence on tobacco products and guide researches to set research priorities on this topic.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

This study evaluated two evidence-based CHW models of treatment. It was hypothesized that smokers assigned to a CHW face-to-face condition would have higher abstinence at 12-month posttreatment than smokers enrolled in CHW referral to a state-sponsored quitline condition. Intrapersonal and treatment-related factors associated with abstinence at 12 months were determined. METHODS: A group-randomized trial was conducted with residents of 12 Ohio Appalachian counties with counties (n = 6) randomized to either a CHW face-to-face (F2F) or CHW quitline (QL) condition. Both conditions included behavioral counseling and free nicotine replacement therapy for 8 weeks. Follow-up data were collected at 3-, 6-, and 12-month posttreatment. Biochemically validated abstinence at 12 months served as the primary outcome. RESULTS: Seven hundred and seven participants were enrolled (n = 353 CHWF2F; n = 354 CHWQL). Baseline sample characteristics did not differ by condition. Using an intent-to-treat analysis (85.4% retention at 12 months), 13.3% of CHWF2F participants were abstinent at 12 months, compared to 10.7% of CHWQL members (OR = 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.810, 2.014; p = .292). No differences in abstinence were noted at 3 or 6 months by condition. Age, marital status, and baseline levels of cigarette consumption, depressive symptoms, and self-efficacy for quitting in positive settings were associated with abstinence, as was counseling dose during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This research adds to the body of science evaluating the effectiveness of CHW models of tobacco dependence treatment. Both approaches may offer promise in low-resource settings and underserved regions. IMPLICATIONS: This 12-county community-based group-randomized trial in Ohio Appalachia adds to the body of science evaluating the effectiveness of CHW models of tobacco dependence treatment. Both CHW approaches may offer promise in low-resource settings and underserved regions. These findings are useful to national, state, and local tobacco control agencies, as they expand delivery of preventive health care services postadoption of the Affordable Care Act in the United States.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The likelihood of exclusive snus use compared with dual use may depend in part on the capacity of snus to deliver nicotine in doses that are satisfactory to smokers. We examined characteristics of ""American snus"" products, including nicotine levels, and compared to snus products that are more typical of Sweden. METHODS: Tobacco industry reports for snus products submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for the year 2014 were used to assess moisture (%), pH, total nicotine, and unionized (free) nicotine (both mg/g and percent of total). A total of 14 (""American"") snus products made by American manufacturers Philip Morris USA (n = 6), R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (n = 6), and US Smokeless Tobacco Company (n = 2), were compared with Swedish-style (""Swedish"") snus products (n = 10) made by Swedish Match North America. RESULTS: Compared with Swedish snus, American snus brands contained significantly lower concentrations of unionized nicotine (median: 0.52 mg/g vs. 6.52 mg/g; p < .001) and proportion of unionized nicotine (median: 3.17% vs. 81.8%; p < .001). American snus brands also had significantly lower pH (median: 6.54 vs. 8.68; p < .001) and moisture (median: 30.3% vs. 53.4%; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Swedish-made snus has higher unionized nicotine, measured by concentration and proportion of total nicotine, compared with snus products made by American manufacturers. These findings suggest that American snus products have lower addiction potential than Swedish snus, and may be more likely to be used dually with cigarettes than as a sole source of nicotine. IMPLICATIONS: American snus products contain significantly lower unionized nicotine, lower pH, and lower moisture, compared with Swedish snus products. Snus addiction potential and patterns of usage, including co-use with cigarettes, may differ between American and Swedish snus products due to differences in snus product characteristics.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

This study examined the content of warning statements and safety characteristics of electronic cigarette liquid bottles using a national sample. METHODS: Research staff randomly selected four electronic cigarette liquid manufacturers/distributors from four US geographic regions. Staff documented the characteristics of product packaging and content of warning statements on 147 electronic cigarette liquids (0-30 mg/ml of nicotine) purchased online from 16 manufacturers/distributors in April of 2016. RESULTS: Data showed that 97.9% of the electronic cigarette liquid bottles included a warning statement, most of which focused on nicotine exposure rather than health. Only 22.4% of bottles used a warning statement that indicated the product ""contained nicotine."" Of bottles that advertised a nicotine-based concentration of 12 mg/ml, 26% had a warning statements stated that the product ""contains nicotine."" None of the statements that indicated that the product ""contained nicotine"" stated that nicotine was ""addictive."" All bottles had a safety cap and 12% were in plastic shrink-wrap. Fifty-six percent of the websites had a minimum age requirement barrier that prevented under-aged persons from entering. CONCLUSIONS: Most manufacturers/distributors printed a warning statement on electronic cigarette liquid bottles, but avoided warning consumers about the presence and the addictiveness of nicotine. Studies are needed to examine manufacturer/distributor modifications to product packaging and how packaging affects consumer behaviors. IMPLICATIONS: These data can inform future FDA requirements related to the packaging and advertising of e-cigarette liquids; regulation related to the content of warning statements, including exposure warning statements, which are not currently mandated; and requirements on websites or language on packaging to help manufacturers adhere to the minimum age of purchase regulation. The data can also be used to help FDA develop additional guidance on the framing of statements on packaging that helps consumers make informed decisions about purchasing the product or protecting young people from use or unintentional exposure to the product.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study sought to identify and describe patents related to innovations for e-cigarette devices associated and weight loss. METHODS: Relevant patents were identified using Google Patents with the core search terms: ""electronic cigarette"" OR ""e-cigarette"" OR ""vaporizer"" OR ""vapourizer"" AND ""nicotine"" AND ""weight loss"" OR ""weight control"" OR ""obesity"" OR ""hunger"". Patents were reviewed to identify and classify the innovation related to weight loss or weight control. RESULTS: Our search identified 23 unique patents that were filed between 2004 and 2015. Patent applications were sponsored by individual inventors (n = 7), tobacco companies (n = 5), e-cigarette companies (n = 8), pharmaceutical companies (n = 2) and a cannabis company (n = 1). More than half the patents (n = 12) were filed in the United States; other countries included China, Germany, South Korea, and South Africa. Strategies included using e-cigarette devices to deliver constituents to users that support weight loss through altered metabolism, reduced nutrient absorption, suppressed appetite, or supported healthy behavior change. In most cases (n = 18), the innovations detailed in the patents were intended to be used with an e-cigarette device that delivered nicotine to the user. CONCLUSIONS: Companies from around the world, and from a range of industries are developing and patenting technologies related to e-cigarettes and weight loss. E-cigarettes may be presented to cigarette users as a possible solution to support smoking cessation and address the fear of weight gain. IMPLICATIONS: This article presents evidence that a range of industries are innovating to design e-cigarettes or constituents to be used with e-cigarettes to deliver a variety of drugs beyond nicotine including weight loss drugs, laxatives, and nutritional supplements. This study may inform surveillance studies to systematically include weight loss as a possible motivation to use e-cigarettes. Further, market surveillance of e-cigarette products needs to monitor ingredients in e-liquids including constituents that have been historically used for weight loss or weight control. Regulations around e-cigarette marketing, promotion, product design including e-liquid constituents need to consider weight loss claims.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We sought to determine whether demographic shifts occurred among the participants reporting Pall Mall as their usual brand during this time span. METHOD: We examined National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data from 2002-2014. Demographic characteristics included age, education, ethnicity, income, and cigarette use (cigarettes per day, daily/non-daily smoking, and nicotine dependence). We also examined RJ Reynolds investor reports and shareholder documents to determine the impact of tobacco marketing on the growth of Pall Mall. RESULTS: Over 2002-2014, Pall Mall has gained among smokers 26 to 34 years of age. More Pall Mall smokers in 2014 report higher incomes (over $75000), and also report lower scores on measures of cigarette dependence, compared to 2002. Pall Mall smokers over time seem to share characteristics of premium cigarette brands smokers. CONCLUSION: The profile of the typical Pall Mall smoker has changed as the brand has gained market share. An association exists between brand positioning and economic forces, which has contributed to an increase in the market share for Pall Mall. IMPLICATIONS: It is well known that cigarette marketing drives the sale of tobacco products. The growth in the market share of Pall Mall serves as an excellent example to demonstrate how economic uncertainty paired with brand positioning and advertising worked together to serve as a catalyst for the rapid growth observed for this brand. This paper also looked at various demographic changes that occurred among Pall Mall smokers over a 12 year period and compared them to smokers of all other cigarette brands. The results of this analysis demonstrate the importance of monitoring trends over time among cigarette smokers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, little is known about their placement at the point-of-sale. We explored the placement of various ENDS types among tobacco retailers. METHODS: Systematic assessments at the point-of-sale were completed by trained data collectors in 90 tobacco retailers, including grocery stores, convenience stores, and pharmacies in North Carolina, United States. Availability and placement of various ENDS types including cigalikes, e-hookahs, tank systems, and e-liquids was recorded. RESULTS: Almost all retailers (97.8%) sold cigalikes; 41.4% sold devices labeled as e-hookahs; 54.4% sold tank systems; and 56.2% sold e-liquids. Fewer than half of stores placed ENDS exclusively behind the counter; significant differences in ENDS placement were found by store type. Grocery stores carried cigalikes, tank systems, and e-liquids and placed them exclusively behind the counter. Pharmacies only sold cigalikes; most placed them exclusively behind the counter (91.7%) with cessation aids and other tobacco products. Convenience stores carried all ENDS types and placed them with other tobacco products (55.1%) and candy (17.4%). Only about one-third of convenience stores placed ENDS exclusively behind the counter. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study shows ENDS availability and placement at the point-of-sale varies by retailer type. Pharmacies placed cigalikes with cessation aids behind the counter suggesting their ability to aid in smoking cessation. Most convenience stores placed ENDS in self-service locations, making them easily accessible to youth. Findings highlight the need for ENDS regulation at the point-of-sale. IMPLICATIONS: Our study highlights the need for regulatory efforts aimed at ENDS placement at the point-of-sale. While pharmacies and grocery stores offered fewer ENDS types and typically placed them in clerk-assisted locations, all ENDS types were found at convenience stores, some of which were placed in youth-friendly locations. Regulatory efforts to control ENDS placement and limit youth exposure should be examined, such as requiring products be placed in clerk-assisted locations and banning ENDS placement next to candy.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The World Health Organization has recommended a lowering of cigarette filler nicotine levels to below 0.4 mg/g. To devise appropriate nicotine control strategies, regulators must consider technical feasibility, timelines for compliance, and potential impediments to implementation. Outlined here is previously unsummarized information on genetic approaches that might be used to reduce nicotine levels in cured tobacco leaves. For the benefit of regulators, altered alkaloid or toxicant profiles that might result by implementation of some of these methodologies are discussed. Also mentioned are potential licensing or regulatory impediments to use of some of the technologies per se. Implications: An understanding of technical feasibility of plant-based nicotine reduction technologies, along with the potential for corresponding alterations in alkaloid or toxicant profiles, is needed by regulators to develop effective nicotine control strategies with minimal impediments or undesirable consequences.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The tobacco industry has a history targeting LGBT with marketing efforts, likely contributing to this disparity. This study explores whether exposure to tobacco content on traditional and social media is associated with tobacco use among LGBT and non-LGBT. METHODS: This study reports results from LGBT (N = 1092) and non-LGBT (N = 16430) respondents to a 2013 nationally representative cross-sectional online survey of US adults (N = 17522). Frequency and weighted prevalence were estimated and adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: LGBT reported significantly higher rates of past 30-day tobacco media exposure compared to non-LGBT, this effect was strongest among LGBT who were smokers (p < .05). LGBT more frequently reported exposure to, searching for, or sharing messages related to tobacco couponing, e-cigarettes, and anti-tobacco on new or social media (eg, Twitter, Facebook, etc.) than did non-LGBT (p < .05). Non-LGBT reported more exposure from traditional media sources such as television, most notably anti-tobacco messages (p = .0088). LGBT had higher odds of past 30-day use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and cigars compared to non-LGBT, adjusting for past 30-day media exposure and covariates (p ≤ .0001). CONCLUSIONS: LGBT (particularly LGBT smokers) are more likely to be exposed to and interact with tobacco-related messages on new and social media than their non-LGBT counterparts. Higher levels of tobacco media exposure were significantly associated with higher likelihood of tobacco use. This suggests tobacco control must work toward reaching LGBT across a variety of media platforms, particularly new and social media outlets. IMPLICATIONS: This study provides important information about LGBT communities tobacco-related disparities in increased exposure to pro-tobacco messages via social media, where the tobacco industry has moved since the MSA. Further, LGBT when assessed as a single population appear to identify having decreased exposure to anti-tobacco messages via traditional media, where we know a large portion of tobacco control and prevention messages are placed. The study points to the need for targeted and tailored approaches by tobacco control to market to LGBT using on-line resources and tools in order to help reduce LGBT tobacco-related health disparities. Although there have been localized campaigns, only just recently have such LGBT-tailored national campaigns been developed by the CDC, FDA, and Legacy, assessment of the content, effectiveness, and reach of both local and national campaigns will be important next steps.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

METHODS: The Truth Tobacco Industry Documents collection at the University of California San Francisco was searched for information on thirdhand smoke. RESULTS: In 1991, scientists at Philip Morris Inc conducted some of the first studies on thirdhand cigarette smoke. For 110 days, 8 hours a day, they ran sidestream cigarette smoke through a 30 m3 room that contained carpet, curtain, and textured wallpaper. The room was ventilated with clean air every night. By comparing the chemicals in the air during the 8-hour smoking period and during the clean air ventilation period, they showed that some smoke chemicals persist in the air 12 hours after smoking. By extracting the nicotine and nitrosamines from samples of the carpet, curtain, and wallpaper, they found that high concentrations of nicotine and the carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) persisted in the room for more than 50 days; that surface chemistry affected nitrosamine concentrations; and that the concentration of NNK in the room, 110 days after the last cigarette was extinguished, could exceed the mass of NNK that entered the room as smoke. CONCLUSIONS: These data, from a controlled environment where the total number of cigarettes smoked is known, provide further evidence that cigarette smoke chemicals remain in the environment for months after smoking, that they reemit back into the air, and that they react to form new toxins and carcinogens. Smoke-free policies are the best method to reduce exposure to thirdhand smoke. IMPLICATIONS: This unpublished, original research from Philip Morris Inc demonstrates that majority of the nicotine and tobacco-specific nitrosamines in the secondhand smoke from each cigarette smoked indoors remains on indoor surfaces for months after the cigarette is extinguished. It also demonstrates that elevated concentrations of nicotine, ammonia, formaldehyde, and the gas-phase nitrosamine, N-nitrosopyrrolidine, can be found in the air for more than 12 hours after smoking; that surface chemistry affects nitrosamine formation and persistence; and that the amount of the carcinogenic nitrosamine NNK that persists months after smoking ends can exceed the amount that actually came out of the cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

There is limited published evidence examining changes in the ENDS marketplace prior to the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) deeming rule in 2016. This study describes US ENDS retail market trends from 2010 to 2016. METHODS: National data were obtained from Nielsen retail scanners for five product types: (1) disposables, (2) rechargeables, (3) cartridge replacements, (4) e-liquid bottle refills, and (5) specialty vapor products. We examined dollar sales, volume, price, brand, and flavor. RESULTS: Adjusted national sales increased from $11.6 million in 2010 to $751.2 million in 2016. The annual rate of sales growth rapidly increased before slowing through 2015. The rate of growth spiked in 2016. Market share for menthol products and other assorted flavors increased from 20% in 2010 to 52.1% by 2016. NJOY's early market dominance shifted as tobacco industry brands entered the market and eventually captured 87.8% of share by 2016. Rechargeables and accompanying products comprised an increased proportion of total volume sold over time while disposable volume declined. Specialty vapor products appeared at retail in 2015. CONCLUSIONS: Findings show strong early growth in the ENDS retail market followed by considerable slowing over time, despite a slight uptick in 2016. Trends reflect shifts to flavored products, newer generation ""open-system"" devices, lower prices, and tobacco industry brands. This study provides a baseline against which to compare the impact of FDA's 2016 deeming rule and future actions on the ENDS marketplace. IMPLICATIONS: This study uses market scanner data from US retail outlets to describe trends in the ENDS retail market from 2010 to 2016, providing a baseline against which to compare the impact of FDA's 2016 deeming rule and future actions on the ENDS marketplace. Understanding historical market trends is valuable in assessing how future regulatory efforts and advances in ENDS technology may impact industry response and consumer uptake and use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The European Union (EU) Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) prescribes that Member States shall require manufacturers and importers of tobacco products to carry out comprehensive studies on these additives to assess their contribution to any of the properties listed in Article 6 of the TPD: toxicity or addictiveness, characterizing flavor, inhalation facilitation, nicotine uptake, and carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic for reproduction. The Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental, and Emerging Risks (SCHEER) has provided guidance on the type and criteria for comprehensive studies, and on the most suitable methodologies to test these 15 tobacco additives as well as additives on future updated lists. The SCHEER proposes a stepwise strategy as the most pragmatic and efficient way to assess the effects of tobacco additives. In addition to proposing specific steps and tests to be considered by industry, some general criteria were also identified such as no comparative testing (testing cigarettes with and without the additive) and no animal studies. As tobacco additives have no benefits for health, but rather may promote use of and addiction to an extremely toxic product, a risk-benefit analysis is not the appropriate paradigm for assessing the additive. When comprehensive studies confirm that additives have any of the properties listed in Article 6 of the TPD, regulatory actions should be considered. If uncertainties cannot be solved by comprehensive studies, the SCHEER recommends that the assessors consider the worst-case evaluation. IMPLICATIONS: In this article, the SCHEER proposes a stepwise strategy to assess (1) the toxic and addictive effects, (2) the characterizing flavor, and (3) facilitating inhalation properties of tobacco additives. The proposed steps and tests provide guidance to (1) Member State on which comprehensive studies should be requested and (2) tobacco industry on which strategy of testing should be applied to address the request and to prepare reports to be sent to the relevant authorities for the evaluation of tobacco additives ""safety"" to comply with the Tobacco Products Directive 2014/40/EU.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Owing to these reasons, in May 2015, the province of Ontario introduced a menthol ban on tobacco products that came into effect in January 2017 prior to a Federal Canadian Ban in October 2017. The objective of this article was to assess the effect of a provincial menthol ban on cigarette wholesale sales in Ontario. METHODS: Wholesale data submitted by tobacco manufacturers to Health Canada pursuant to the federal Tobacco Reporting Regulations from October 2012 to September 2017 were analyzed using interrupted time-series analysis. Changes in sales of cigarettes with and without menthol were estimated, using the province of British Columbia as a comparison. Analyses were seasonally adjusted. RESULTS: Sales of menthol and nonmenthol cigarettes increased from 2013 until the implementation of the 2017 provincial ban. Subsequently, a sharp decline of 55 million menthol cigarettes and 128 million total cigarettes was observed in Ontario. As a comparison, no significant changes were observed in British Columbia. CONCLUSION: This study supports the conclusion that implementation of a menthol ban in Ontario was associated with significant reduction of menthol cigarette sales and total cigarettes sales, compared to British Columbia where there was no provincial menthol ban. This suggests that menthol regulations in jurisdictions with a larger percentage of menthol smokers are likely to be highly effective. IMPLICATIONS: The 2017 menthol ban was associated with significant reduction of menthol cigarette sales and total cigarette sales suggesting that menthol regulations will have important effects on cigarette consumption.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In 2013, the NIH funded 14 Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science (TCORS), which serve as partners in establishing research, training, and professional development programs to guide FDA. Each of the fourteen TCORS, and two other NIH-funded research programs, the Center for the Evaluation of Nicotine in Cigarettes (CENIC) and the Consortium on Methods Evaluating Tobacco (COMET), pursued specific research themes relevant to FDA's priorities. A key mandate for FDA is to reduce tobacco use among young people. This article is a review of the peer-reviewed research, including published and in-press manuscripts, from the TCORS, CENIC, and COMET, which provides specific data or other findings on youth (ages 10-18 years) and/or young adults (ages 18-34 years), from 2013 to 2018. Citations of all TCORS, CENIC, and COMET articles from September 2013 to December 2017 were collected by the TCORS coordinating center, the Center for Evaluation and Coordination of Training and Research. Additional citations up to April 30, 2018 were requested from the principal investigators. A scoring rubric was developed and implemented to assess study type, primary theme, and FDA priority area addressed by each article. The major subareas and findings from each priority area are presented. There were 766 articles in total, with 258 (34%) focusing on youth and/or young adults. Findings relevant to FDA from this review concern impact analysis, toxicity, health effects, addiction, marketing influences, communications, and behavior. IMPLICATIONS: The Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science, CENIC, and COMET have had a high output of scientific articles since 2013. These Centers are unique in that the FDA supports science specifically to guide future regulatory actions. The 258 articles that have focused on youth and/or young adults are providing data for regulatory actions by the FDA related to the key priority areas such as the addictiveness of non-cigarette products, the effects of exposure to electronic cigarette marketing on initiation and cessation, and the impact of flavored products on youth and young adult tobacco use. Future regulations to reduce tobacco use will be guided by the cumulative evidence. These Centers are one innovative mechanism to promote important outcomes to advance tobacco regulatory science.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We examine how exposure to these marketing activities influences product-specific use behaviors. METHODS: We analyzed data from 10 081 youth (aged 12-18 years) who participated in Waves 1 and 2 (2013-2015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. Participants reported past 6-month tobacco coupon receipt and online tobacco marketing engagement, and susceptibility to ever and current use of cigarette, e-cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and hookah. Weighted multivariable logistic regression examined Wave 1 predictors of coupon receipt at Wave 2, and associations between coupon receipt, online engagement, and past 30-day use of different tobacco products. RESULTS: Youth received tobacco coupons at one (9.7%) or both waves (1.2%) and 11.1% engaged with online tobacco marketing. Coupon receipt and online marketing engagement at Wave 1 predicted Wave 2 coupon receipt among susceptible-never, ever-but-not-current, and current tobacco users (p < .05). Coupon receipt and online engagement at Wave 1 was positively associated with past 30-day use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and hookah at Wave 2 (p < .05). The relationships were stronger for those who received coupons at both waves or engaged with more sources of online marketing. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco direct-to-consumer marketing is reaching youth. Repeated exposure to these marketing activities within and across media is associated with use of different tobacco products. New policies and strong enforcement of existing regulations prohibiting these illegal marketing tactics are critical to protect youth from future tobacco use. IMPLICATIONS: Tobacco companies utilize coupons and online engagement activities to increase brand awareness, knowledge, and sales of their products. These kinds of marketing activities can be influential among youth at a time when they may develop tobacco use behaviors. Our findings suggest that tobacco companies may be targeting at-risk youth through cross-media marketing activities. The findings also indicate that exposure to these marketing activities predicts subsequent use of different tobacco products, with suggestive dose-response relationships. Increased regulations are needed to protect youth from these marketing activities.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: The SRNT Treatment Research Network convened a group of investigators with expertise in tobacco biomarkers to update the recommendations of the 2002 SNRT Biochemical Verification Report. RESULTS: Biochemical verification of tobacco use and abstinence increases scientific rigor and is recommended in clinical trials of smoking cessation, when feasible. Sources, appropriate biospecimens, cutpoints, time of detection windows and analytic methods for carbon monoxide, cotinine (including over the counter tests), total nicotine equivalents, minor tobacco alkaloids, and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol are reviewed, as well as biochemical approaches to distinguishing cigarette smoking from use of electronic nicotine delivery devices (ENDS). CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations are provided for whether and how to use biochemical verification of tobacco use and abstinence. Guidelines are provided on which biomarkers to use, which biospecimens to use, optimal cutpoints, time windows to detection, and methodology for biochemical verifications. Use of combinations of biomarkers is recommended for assessment of ENDS use. IMPLICATIONS: Biochemical verification increases scientific rigor, but there are drawbacks that need to be assessed to determine whether the benefits of biochemical verification outweigh the costs, including the cost of the assays, the feasibility of sample collection, the ability to draw clear conclusions based on the duration of abstinence, and the variability of the assay within the study population. This paper provides updated recommendations from the 2002 SRNT report on whether and how to use biochemical markers in determining tobacco use and abstinence.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

This study assessed the current literature for trials comparing levels of biomarkers of exposure (BoE) between conventional cigarettes (CC) and heat-not-burn (HNB) devices. METHODS: Ten databases were searched using terms including: ""heat not burn,"" ""iqos,"" ""teeps,"" ""mrtp,"" ""tobacco heating,"" and ""glo"" between January 1, 2010 and August 13, 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing comparative BoE levels in humans using either CC or novel HNB devices were eligible. BoE were tabulated, and differences between the intervention and control groups were analyzed and combined using a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Ten nonblinded, RCTs were eligible, involving a total of 1766 participants. Studies regularly reported on 12 BoE (including nicotine). HNB devices assessed included the ""IQOS"" and ""glo"" devices and ""precursor"" (being developed) HNB devices. In comparison to CC, all 12 BoEs assessed were significantly lower for participants assigned to an HNB device. In comparison to smoking abstinence, HNB devices were statistically equivalent for eight BoEs and significantly elevated for four BoEs. CONCLUSIONS: This review found that the potential for harm to humans is reduced when using HNB devices compared to CC as indicated by significant reductions in BoE levels. Whilst these results support tobacco manufacturer claims of improved safety, the small number of studies included, limited range of BoE assessed, and involvement of the tobacco industry necessitate further independent research to confirm the HNB devices as being a safer alternative to CC. IMPLICATIONS: This study supports claims made by tobacco manufacturers on the improved safety of HNB tobacco devices in comparison to CC. These novel devices lead to reduced exposure to key biomarkers, which are linked to the health consequences attributed to tobacco use.

Type of salt could play a significant role in the abuse liability of electronic cigarette liquids. As a first step to understanding nicotine salts, this study sought to identify the types of acids present in 23 commercially available electronic cigarette liquids. AIMS AND METHODS: Twenty-three electronic cigarette liquids advertised as containing nicotine salts were purchased for analysis. These liquids were tested for the presence of 11 different organic acids that were deemed likely to be used in a nicotine salt formulation. Liquids were analyzed using a combination of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods, then compared to authentic acid standards for identification. RESULTS: Six of the 11 possible acids were identified in the liquids, from most to least common: lactic, benzoic, levulinic, salicyclic, malic, and tartaric acid. Acid(s) could not be identified in one of the liquids. Though most liquids contained only one type, three of the liquids contained multiple acids. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that several types of salts/acids are currently being used in electronic cigarette liquids. The type and concentration of salt(s) used in these liquids may differentially alter sensations in the throat and upper airway, and overall pharmacology of the aerosols by altering liquid pH and from flavor and sensory characteristics of the acids themselves. IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates that at least six different types of acids are being used to create the nicotine salts in electronic cigarette liquids, with the acids lactic, benzoic, and levulinic being the most frequently identified. Identification of these acids can serve as the foundation for future research to determine if type of nicotine salt alters pharmacological and toxicological effects of electronic cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Menthol provides the smoker with a pleasant mint flavor in addition to a cooling sensation of the mouth, throat, and lungs, giving relief from the painful irritation caused by tobacco smoke. Promising a healthier cigarette using pictures of doctors in white coats and even cartoon penguins, tobacco companies promoted these cigarettes to young, beginner smokers and those with respiratory health concerns. Today, smoking tobacco cigarettes causes one in five US Americans to die prematurely, crowning it as the leading cause of preventable death. In contrast to the dubious health claims by tobacco companies, mentholated cigarettes are in fact more addictive. Smokers of mentholated cigarettes have lower successful quit rates and in some cases are resistant to both behavioral and pharmacological treatment strategies. There is now considerable evidence, especially in the last 5 years, that suggest menthol might influence the addictive potential of nicotine-containing tobacco products via biological mechanisms. First, menthol alters the expression, stoichiometry, and function of nicotinic receptors. Second, menthol's chemosensory properties operate to mask aversive properties of using tobacco products. Third, menthol's chemosensory properties aid in serving as a conditioned cue that can both enhance nicotine intake and drive relapse. Fourth, menthol alters nicotine metabolism, increasing its bioavailability. This review discusses emerging evidence for these mechanisms, with an emphasis on preclinical findings that may shed light on why menthol smokers exhibit greater dependence. IMPLICATIONS: Mentholated cigarettes have been shown to have greater addictive potential than their nonmentholated counterparts. Evidence is pointing toward multiple mechanisms of action by which menthol may alter tobacco dependence. Understanding menthol's biological functions as it pertains to nicotine dependence will be helpful in crafting novel pharmacotherapies that might better serve menthol smokers. In addition, a better understanding of menthol's pharmacology as it relates to tobacco dependence will be valuable for informing policy decisions on the regulation of mentholated cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

These tactics include: using the industry's size, wealth, and legal resources to intimidate individuals and local governmental bodies; setting up 'front groups' to make it appear that it has more allies than it really does; spending large sums of money to frame the public debate about smoking regulations around 'rights and liberty' rather than health and portraying its tobacco company adversaries as extremists; 'investing' thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to politicians; and using financial resources to influence science. These tactics are designed to produce delay, giving the nicotine cartel more time to collect even more profits at the direct expense of millions of lives around the world.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to assess the explanatory power of FTC tar, the particular manufacturer, and other cigarette characteristics to predict the yields of four TSNAs (N'-nitrosonornicotine [NNN], 4-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone [NNK], N'-nitrosoanatabine [NAT], and N'-nitrosoanabasine [NAB]) in 26 US commercial brands tested in the 1999 Massachusetts Benchmark Study. RESULTS: When FTC tar alone was used to predict TSNA yield, the squared correlation coefficient (R(2)) was only 38% for NNN, 76% for NNK, 46% for NAT, and 49% for NAB. Inclusion of manufacturer-specific variables significantly (p < 0.001) increased the estimated R(2) for three of the four species of nitrosamine to: 78% for NNN, 88% for NNK, and 81% for NAT. Inclusion of other cigarette characteristics (filter type, paper permeability, tobacco weight, tip dilution) did not reduce the significance of the manufacturer-specific effects. Federal Trade Commission nicotine and carbon monoxide (CO) yields were no better at predicting TSNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: FTC ratings for tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide do not tell the entire story about the comparative yields of toxic agents in marketed cigarette brands. The significant manufacturer-specific effects suggest that proprietary blending and processing of tobacco matter as well. Public, brand-by-brand disclosure of the yields of TSNA and possibly other smoke constituents appears to be warranted.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Cross-country comparisons can provide insight into how smokers use yields when information is presented differently. We examined whether smokers in four different countries could recall the tar yield of their brand of cigarettes, using data from the third wave of the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey (ITC-4). Of current smokers in the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, 33.6% gave a numeric response when asked to report the tar yield of their brand, whereas 66.4% responded 'I don't know.' American participants (9.2%) were less likely than Canadian (28.0%), UK (36.5%) or Australian (68.2%) smokers to give an answer, even after controlling for sociodemographic and smoking behaviour factors. Constituent labelling policies can affect whether smokers report a tar yield for their cigarette brand. Pack labelling appears to be useful for conveying information about cigarettes to smokers; however, there is an urgent need to develop more meaningful information on toxic constituents of cigarette smoke.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Harm reduction is one policy option. Smokers smoke for the nicotine, but die from the other toxins in cigarette smoke. Harm reduction in tobacco control aims to reduce the harm arising from nicotine use by shifting smokers, who are unable to quit, to using far less hazardous sources of nicotine, notably medicinal nicotine, in place of cigarettes. This article argues that for harm reduction to work in the UK, a nicotine product regulation authority is first needed. This would regulate nicotine products in proportion to harm to ensure that, contrary to the current paradoxical arrangements, the most harmful source of nicotine, the cigarette, becomes the most highly regulated (and thus the least easily accessible, available and attractive). It goes onto explore how a harm reduction strategy might be further developed, exploring controversies and potential pitfalls. It argues that the public health community needs to own and drive this debate because failure to do so would let the tobacco industry gain the upper hand and see thousands of more unnecessary deaths from tobacco use.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

This study examined the tobacco industry's efforts to establish and promulgate beliefs about schizophrenic individuals' need to smoke and the hazards of quitting. The current study analyzed previously secret tobacco industry documents. The initial search was conducted during January-July 2005 in the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library. The search yielded 280 records dating from 1955 to 2004. Documents indicate the tobacco industry monitored or directly funded research supporting the idea that individuals with schizophrenia were less susceptible to the harms of tobacco and that they needed tobacco as self-medication. The tobacco industry promoted smoking in psychiatric settings by providing cigarettes and supporting efforts to block hospital smoking bans. The tobacco industry engaged in a variety of direct and indirect efforts that likely contributed to the slowed decline in smoking prevalence in schizophrenia via slowing nicotine dependence treatment development for this population and slowing the rate of policy implementation vis-à-vis smoking bans on psychiatric units.,"['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

They initiate olfactory, gustatory, and chemesthetic sensations; influence human brain cognition and emotion; and guide a wide variety of behaviors essential for survival, including protective reactions, such as avoidance of contaminated foods and potential toxicants. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) aerosolize e-liquids for inhaled consumption that typically contain flavorants, propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, and nicotine. E-liquid aerosols also contain toxicants, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and heavy metals. Chemosensory evaluation of ENDS aerosol plays an essential role in the assessment of whether a product will attract new users of all ages, as well as determining their likely use patterns, perceptions of product harm, satisfaction, and product selection. Nicotine and individual flavorant constituents stimulate multiple sensory receptor systems in complex patterns, initiating distinctive sensory perceptions depending on the chemical properties and quantity in the aerosol. There are limited data on chemosensory evaluation of ENDS aerosols and their influence on ENDS use and protective biologic mechanisms.

For smokers who want to quit, nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion are frequently recommended. Currently, disagreement surrounds the extent of risk reduction from quitting, the consequences of the change of nicotine replacement therapy to over-the-counter status, and the safety and efficacy of new tobacco products being marketed by tobacco companies. This article reviews the current evidence relevant to these and other developments in smoking interventions and describes the most effective strategies that smokers can use to reduce their risk. RECENT FINDINGS: Although it may take approximately 10 to 30 years of abstinence for former smokers' risk of lung cancer to reach that of never smokers, quitting at any time is substantially less risky than continuing to smoke. Quitting after diagnosis also prolongs survival. Bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy are effective pharmacotherapies, doubling quit rates compared with self-quitting. However, many users of over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy are using it inappropriately. More research is needed to determine the long-term health effects of modified tobacco products and their efficacy in helping smokers quit. Switching to ""low tar"" filter cigarettes to reduce lung cancer risk, however, is clearly ineffective. The most effective interventions for quitting continue to be a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic approaches. SUMMARY: Health care practitioners should encourage all smokers to attempt cessation and emphasize pharmacotherapy as an important aid to quitting. Professionals who educate patients on the appropriate use of pharmacotherapy and follow-up on smokers' attempts to quit will help reduce the societal burden and personal risks of smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Nonetheless, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved options for adolescents with SUD are limited. The purpose of this study was to systematically assess the number and characteristics of clinical trials testing medications for SUD in adolescent populations (aged <18) during the past 25 years. METHODS: We performed a scoping review to identify randomized-controlled trials of medications for SUD that were available in Cochrane CENTRAL or clinicaltrials.gov, active between January 1, 1999 and December 4, 2024, and included at least one participant aged 13-17, with none aged 26 years or older. Key study characteristics were extracted and analyzed to identify trends in design, medications tested, and participant diversity. RESULTS: Thirty-six trials of 15 unique medications met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 26 had published results, one was currently active, 3 had reported results on clinicaltrials.gov but lacked a publication, and 6 had not yet reported their results in any form. Medications for nicotine use disorder were most commonly studied (41.7%, N = 15), while stimulant use disorder (2.7%, N = 1) and benzodiazepine use disorder (N = 0) were the least represented. Although the collection and reporting of demographic-related factors were inconsistent, the demographic data available demonstrated low participation of individuals aged younger than 18, racial/ethnic minorities, and gender-diverse youth. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence base informing medications to treat SUD in adolescents is small. Additional research is urgently needed to address knowledge gaps, enhance participant diversity, and promote access to evidence-based SUD treatment for youth.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Despite these difficulties, recent studies have demonstrated moderate success in implementing smoking cessation treatment in drug rehabilitation programs. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network sponsored a smoking cessation study in 13 community-based outpatient substance abuse rehabilitation programs across the country. The study evaluated the effectiveness of smoking cessation treatment provided as an adjunct to substance abuse treatment-as-usual. This report summarizes the practical and clinical experiences encountered at each of the study sites with regard to implementing the smoking cessation treatment intervention. Smoking behavior of the treatment clientele was assessed by anonymous survey at each site. In addition, sites were systematically characterized by using program review and assessment tools completed by the respective staff and program directors at the site. Survey and recruitment data indicated that cigarette smoking is more prevalent and that smoking cessation treatment is more feasible, in methadone maintenance treatment programs.

E-cigarettes were initially introduced as a means of smoking cessation, although evidence of their effectiveness is limited. There is a widespread perception that these products are a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, driven in large part by marketing efforts by e-cigarette manufacturers. Yet to achieve vaporization, temperatures are so high that components of the device hardware, such as metals, plastics, rubber and foam, are aerosolized and inhaled along with the vaporized e-liquid containing nicotine, flavoring and solvents. We do not fully understand the health consequences of such aerosol exposure, particularly long-term effects, but short-term negative cardiovascular and respiratory effects have been demonstrated. Very few studies have evaluated the reproductive effect of e-cigarette use. We do not know whether vaping during pregnancy affects birth outcomes or the lifelong health of the fetus. There has been an exponential rise in the use of e-cigarettes in the United States since their introduction, particularly among youths, while concurrently there has been a laudable reduction in conventional cigarette use. It is imperative that obstetrician-gynecologists have a basic understanding of e-cigarettes, screen all patients as is consistently done for conventional smoking, and provide resources to patients about potential negative consequences of use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

International cigarette manufacturers are promoting new snuff products, and the use of Swedish snuff is increasing, especially among women of childbearing age. The effect of Swedish snuff on pregnancy complications is unknown. METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we estimated the risk of stillbirth in snuff users (n = 7629), light smokers (1-9 cigarettes/day; n = 41,488), and heavy smokers (≥10 cigarettes/day; n = 17,014), using nontobacco users (n = 504,531) as reference. RESULTS: Compared with nontobacco users, snuff users had an increased risk of stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio = 1.6 [95% confidence interval = 1.1-2.3]); the risk was higher for preterm (<37 weeks) stillbirth (2.1 [1.3-3.4]). For light smokers, the adjusted odds ratio of stillbirth was 1.4 (1.2-1.7) and the corresponding risk for heavy smokers was 2.4 (2.0-3.0). When we excluded women with preeclampsia or antenatal bleeding and infants who were small for gestational age, the smoking-related risks of stillbirth was markedly attenuated; the elevated risk for snuff users remained the same level. CONCLUSIONS: Use of Swedish snuff during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of stillbirth. The mechanism behind this increased risk seems to differ from the underlying mechanism in smokers. Swedish snuff does not appear to be a safe alternative to cigarette smoking during pregnancy.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study explored associations of functional candidate gene polymorphisms with initial sensitivity to nicotine in 101 young adult nonsmokers of European ancestry. Nicotine (0, 5, 10 microg/kg) was administered through nasal spray followed by mood, nicotine reward (e.g. 'liking') and perception (e.g. 'feel effects') measures, physiological responses, sensory processing (prepulse inhibition of startle), and performance tasks. Nicotine reinforcement was assessed in a separate session using a nicotine versus placebo spray choice procedure. For the dopamine D4 receptor [DRD4 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR)], presence of the 7-repeat allele was associated with greater aversive responses to nicotine (decreases in 'vigor', positive affect, and rapid information processing; increased cortisol) and reduced nicotine choice. Individuals with at least one DRD4 7-repeat allele also reported increased 'feel effects' and greater startle response, but in men only. Other genetic associations were also observed in men but not women, such as greater 'feel effects' and anger, and reduced fatigue, in the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2 C957T single nucleotide polymorphism) TT versus CT or CC genotypes. Very few or no significant associations were seen for the DRD2/ANKK1 TaqIA polymorphism, the serotonin transporter promoter VNTR or 5HTTLPR (SLC6A4), the dopamine transporter 3' VNTR (SLC6A3), and the mu opioid receptor A118G single nucleotide polymorphism (mu opioid receptor polymorphism 1). Although these results are preliminary, this study is the first to suggest that genetic polymorphisms related to function in the dopamine D4, and perhaps D2, receptor may modulate initial sensitivity to nicotine before the onset of dependence and may do so differentially between men and women.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The prevalence of CYP2A6 gene variants differs by race, with greater numbers in African Americans compared with Caucasians. We studied nicotine disposition kinetics and metabolism by the CYP2A6 genotype and enzymatic activity, as measured by the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), in African American smokers. METHODS: Participants were administered intravenous infusions of deuterium-labeled nicotine and cotinine. Plasma and urine concentrations of nicotine and metabolites were measured and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic parameters and urine metabolite excretion data were analyzed by CYP2A6 genotype and by NMR. A number of gene variants were associated with markedly reduced nicotine and cotinine clearances. NMR was strongly correlated with nicotine (r=0.72) and cotinine (r=0.80) clearances.

METHODS: Participants [Caucasians (Whites), African Americans (Blacks) and Asian-Americans (Asians)] received an oral solution of deuterium-labeled nicotine and its metabolite cotinine. Plasma and saliva concentrations of nicotine and cotinine were used to determine oral clearances. Rates of glucuronidation were assessed from urine glucuronide/parent ratios, and UGT2B10 and UGT2B17 genotypes from DNA. RESULTS: Among the 227 participants, 96 (42%) were White, 67 (30%) Asian and 64 (28%) Black. Compared to the other two races, Whites had higher nicotine and cotinine total oral clearance, Blacks had lower nicotine and cotinine glucuronidation rates and Asians had lower 3'-hydroxycotinine glucuronidation rates. A strong positive correlation (correlations coefficients 0.77-0.84; P < 0.001) between NMR and nicotine oral clearance was found for all three races, and NMR remained a strong predictor for the nicotine oral clearance while adjusting for race, sex and age. Neither the metabolite glucuronidation ratios nor the UGT genotypes had significant effects on the ability of NMR to predict nicotine oral clearance. CONCLUSION: NMR appears to be a reliable phenotypic biomarker for nicotine clearance across races, glucuronidation phenotypes and genotypes. Racial differences in the relationships between NMR, smoking behaviors and addiction are unlikely to be related to an inadequate estimation of nicotine clearance on the basis of NMR.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Variations in the CYP2A6 and CYP2B6 genes, encoding enzymes responsible for nicotine metabolic inactivation and procarcinogen activation, have not been characterized in AN and may contribute toward the increased risk. METHODS: AN people (n=400) residing in the Bristol Bay region of South Western Alaska were recruited for a cross-sectional study on tobacco use. They were genotyped for CYP2A6*1X2A, *1X2B, *1B, *2, *4, *7, *8, *9, *10, *12, *17, *35 and CYP2B6*4, *6, *9 and provided plasma and urine samples for the measurement of nicotine and metabolites. RESULTS: CYP2A6 and CYP2B6 variant frequencies among the AN Yupik people (n=361) were significantly different from those in other ethnicities. Nicotine metabolism [as measured by the plasma and urinary ratio of metabolites trans-3'-hydroxycotinine to cotinine (3HC/COT)] was significantly associated with CYP2A6 (P<0.001), but not CYP2B6 genotype (P=0.95) when controlling for known covariates. It was noteworthy that the plasma 3HC/COT ratios were high in the entire Yupik people, and among the Yupik CYP2A6 wild-type participants, they were substantially higher than those in previously characterized racial/ethnic groups (P<0.001 vs. Caucasians and African Americans). CONCLUSION: Yupik AN people have a unique CYP2A6 genetic profile that associated strongly with in-vivo nicotine metabolism. More rapid CYP2A6-mediated nicotine and nitrosamine metabolism in the Yupik people may modulate the risk of tobacco-related diseases.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We quantified association of four SNPs at three nAChRs with abstinence in eight randomized clinical trials. Participants were 2633 outpatient treatment-seeking, self-identified European ancestry individuals smoking at least 10 cigarettes/day, recruited through advertisement, prescribed pharmacotherapy, and provided with behavioral therapy. Interventions included nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, varenicline, placebo (PLA), or combined NRT and bupropion, and five modes of group and individual behavioral therapy. Outcome measures tested in multivariate logistic regression were end of treatment and 6 month (6MO) abstinence, with demographic, behavioral, and genetic covariates. RESULTS: 'Risk' alleles previously associated with smoking heaviness were significantly (P<0.05) associated with reduced abstinence in the PLA pharmacotherapy group (PG) at 6MO [for rs588765, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.41 (0.17-0.99)], and at end of treatment and at 6MO [for rs1051730, 0.42 (0.19-0.93) and 0.31 (0.12-0.80)], and with increased abstinence in the NRT PG at 6MO [for rs588765, 2.07 (1.11-3.87) and for rs1051730, 2.54 (1.29-4.99)]. We observed significant heterogeneity in rs1051730 effects (F=2.48, P=0.021) between PGs. CONCLUSION: chr15q25.1 nAChR SNP risk alleles for smoking heaviness significantly increase relapse with PLA treatment and significantly increase abstinence with NRT. These SNP-PG associations require replication in independent samples for validation, and testing in larger sample sizes to evaluate whether similar effects occur in other PGs.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

However, limited data exist characterizing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) findings. The goal of this study is to further define the pathologic findings from BAL and biopsy samples of subjects with EVALI across 7 institutions. METHODS: A multicentered registry of patients admitted with EVALI who underwent flexible bronchoscopy with BAL+/-transbronchial biopsy from July 2019 to April 2021 was compiled for retrospective evaluation from 7 academic institutions throughout the United States. Radiographic and cytopathologic findings and frequencies were correlated with the substance vaped. RESULTS: Data from 21 subjects (42.9% women) who were predominantly White (76.2%) with a median age of 25 years (range, 16 to 68) with EVALI were included in this study. Sixteen patients (76.2%) reported use of tetrahydrocannabinol; the remainder used nicotine. BAL was performed in 19 of the 21 subjects, and transbronchial lung biopsy was performed in 7 subjects. BAL findings revealed neutrophilic predominance (median, 59.5%, range, 3.1 to 98) in most cases. Ten BAL samples demonstrated pulmonary eosinophilia ranging from 0.2% to 49.1% with one subject suggesting a diagnosis of acute eosinophilic pneumonia associated with the use of e-cigarettes. Lipid-laden macrophages were noted in 10 of 15 reports (66.7%). Transbronchial biopsy most frequently demonstrated patterns of organizing pneumonia (57.1%). CONCLUSION: EVALI-associated BAL findings typically demonstrate a spectrum of nonspecific inflammatory changes, including neutrophilia, lipid-laden macrophages, and in some cases eosinophilia.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In addition to well known conventional inhaled nicotine products, noninhaled products, such as nicotine toothpicks, orbs, lozenges, strips, and more, have dangerously captivated a new youth audience. Although smokeless nicotine products may seem to be less threatening than conventional inhaled nicotine products, there are significant risks associated with the use of these products, including addiction and severe health issues. The purpose of this review is to provide up-to-date information about alternative nicotine products currently on the market that may appeal to youth, and the dangers of nicotine use for pediatric populations. RECENT FINDINGS: Smokeless nicotine products appeal to minors with their varying flavors and discrete packaging. These products may lead to nicotine toxicity as well as severe health problems, such as cancer, issues with reproduction, and heart attacks. Nicotine is extremely dangerous for young children; in fact, using nicotine products before the age of 18 years can lead to addiction and is linked to an increased likelihood of experimenting with stronger nicotine products or illicit drugs. The development of inconspicuous nicotine packaging has led to increasing concerns for accidental nicotine exposure and overdose in youth. SUMMARY: Greater knowledge regarding current nicotine products on the market, specifically smokeless nicotine products, will help clinicians be more aware of the dangers associated with these products. Clinicians will be better able to provide their patients and families with proper guidance to avoid nicotine addiction, further drug use, and detrimental health issues. Caregivers and medical professionals must recognize novel and inconspicuous nicotine products commonly used among youth, understand the signs of nicotine abuse and dependence, and take measures to address possible nicotine-related health risks.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

CASE PRESENTATION: A 22-year-old female with a history of energy vaping presented with cardiac arrest. Found to have no pulse, CPR was started and an initial rhythm of ventricular tachycardia was obtained. Shock was administered with a follow-up rhythm of ventricular fibrillation. She was emergently defibrillated and entered atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Toxicology and troponins were all negative. Left heart catheterization and cardiac MRI were unremarkable. She was discharged with an external defibrillation vest and a tentative plan for outpatient electrophysiology study in the setting of negative work-up for cardiopulmonary arrest. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Vaping-induced sudden cardiac arrest may be attributed to a reduction in cardiac repolarization reserve. Exposure to vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol, substances present in nearly all vape products, have been found to incite arrhythmias and disrupt cardiac conduction in animals. Acrolein, an aldehyde byproduct of glycerin, has also been found to induce arrhythmias due to autonomic dysfunction. Increased intracellular calcium concentration and free radical damage, which occur as a result of inhaling particulate matter generated from e-cigarettes, further propagates the risk of arrhythmia. CONCLUSION: The effects of inhaling vape aerosols remain not fully understood. While there is a perceived notion that nicotine-free aerosols may be harmless, that remains unclear. Further studies are needed to evaluate proarrhythmogenic effects and autonomic dysfunction from the various chemical substances present in vape aerosols.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This resurgence is fueled by its cultural appeal, social nature, and the perception of it being a safer alternative to cigarette smoking. However, mounting evidence suggests that waterpipe smoking has significant cardiovascular consequences, including the development of ventricular dysfunction, a precursor to heart failure. Heart failure (HF), a complex clinical syndrome characterized by the heart's inability to pump blood adequately, affects approximately 64 million people worldwide, with regional variations in prevalence and etiology. In high-income countries, the prevalence ranges from 1-2% of the adult population, increasing to over 10% in individuals above 70 years, while in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the prevalence is often underreported due to limited healthcare access. Emerging evidence links water pipe smoking to ventricular dysfunction through mechanisms such as oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and direct myocardial toxicity. Comparative studies highlight that a single water pipe session delivers greater quantities of carbon monoxide and nicotine than a cigarette, intensifying cardiovascular strain. These substances induce myocardial hypoxia, lipid peroxidation, and cytokine-mediated inflammation, impairing ventricular function. Given the growing prevalence of water pipe smoking, especially among younger populations, this practice constitutes an underrecognized but significant public health risk. Addressing the cardiovascular implications of water pipe smoking requires targeted research and global efforts to enhance awareness, implement preventive strategies, and inform healthcare policies. Water pipe smoking, commonly known as shisha or hookah, is often perceived as a safer alternative to cigarettes. However, mounting evidence shows that it significantly harms the heart. This review highlights how water pipe smoking contributes to heart failure by damaging the heart's pumping ability, increasing oxidative stress, and triggering harmful inflammation. These effects, when prolonged, can lead to severe cardiovascular complications. Understanding these risks is crucial for public awareness and emphasizes the need for stricter regulations and preventive measures against waterpipe smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Emerging evidence identifies neurotransmitter pathways, particularly dopaminergic signaling, as significant modulators of GBM progression. This editorial examines the ""dopamine paradox"" in GBM, where D2-like receptors (D2/D3/D4) drive pro-tumor effects, while D1-like receptors (D1/D5) mediate tumor suppression. Nicotine, through its activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, exacerbates GBM progression by stimulating dopaminergic pro-survival pathways, particularly via D2/D3 receptors. Conversely, methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline demonstrate potential as anti-GBM agents by modulating D1/D5-driven cAMP pathways. These compounds inhibit phosphodiesterases, increasing intracellular cAMP levels, and mimic D1/D5 receptor activation, leading to apoptosis, reduced proliferation, and chemosensitization. This dualistic dopaminergic signaling framework suggests therapeutic opportunities for methylxanthine repurposing to counteract nicotine-driven GBM pathogenesis. This editorial underscores the need for further exploration of dopaminergic modulation in GBM, highlighting the potential of shifting the balance from pro-tumor D2/D3 signaling to antitumor D1/D5 pathways.

We identified 88 independent risk loci; integration with functional genomic tools uncovered 461 potential risk genes, primarily expressed in the brain. TUD was genetically correlated with smoking and psychiatric traits from traditionally ascertained cohorts, externalizing behaviors in children, and hundreds of medical outcomes, including HIV infection, heart disease, and pain.

The exact sweetener contents of ONPs remain unknown. Artificial sweeteners in ONPs may facilitate initiation and encourage consumption behavior. AIMS AND METHODS: Artificial sweetener contents in major US-marketed ONP brands (Zyn, on!, Velo) were determined by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Sweetener effects during the initiation of ONP consumption were modeled in single- and two-bottle tests, offering mice ONP extracts calibrated to contain nicotine levels similar to saliva of people who use smokeless tobacco. To examine the contribution of sweet taste perception, consumption behavior was compared between wild-type mice and mice deficient in the sweet taste receptor (Tas1r2-/-). RESULTS: Acesulfame-K was detected in on!, Zyn and Velo ONPs (~0.3-0.9 mg/pouch), including products marketed as ""Unflavored"" or ""Flavor ban approved"". In Velo ONPs, sweetened with sucralose (0.6-1.2 mg/pouch), higher nicotine strength products contained higher sucralose levels. Tas1r2-/- mice consumed less ONP extracts than wild-type mice in both sexes. ONP extracts with both higher nicotine and sweetener strengths were tolerated by wild-type mice, but produced stronger aversion in Tas1r2-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: ONPs contain significant amounts of artificial sweeteners, with some brands adding more sweetener to ONPs with higher nicotine strengths. Artificial sweeteners, at levels present in ONPs, increase nicotine consumption. Increasing sweetener contents facilitates consumption of ONPs with higher nicotine strengths. Sweetness is a key determinant of ONP use initiation, likely reducing the aversive sensory effects of nicotine and other ONP constituents. IMPLICATIONS: Artificial sweeteners such as acesulfame-K or sucralose reduce aversion and facilitate initiation and continued consumption of ONPs. The marketing of some artificially sweetened ONPs as ""Unflavored"" of ""Flavor ban-approved"" suggests that the tobacco industry rejects sweet taste as a determinant for the presence of a characterizing flavor. Sweetness as imparted by artificial sweeteners in tobacco products needs to be addressed by regulators as a component of a characterizing flavor, with the aim to reduce product appeal and initiation by never users, and especially youth attracted to sweet flavors.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHOD: This study presents a snapshot of nicotine marketing claims for e-cigarettes using Nielsen ScanTrack data from brick-and-mortar stores. Market share was calculated as the ratio of unit sales of each nicotine claim category to the total unit sales of e-cigarettes during the four weeks ending 1-20-2024.

However, the health effects of IQOS product use remain contradictory, and the impact of IQOS product use on respiratory health and immune biomarkers is lacking. Industry sponsored studies suggest IQOS products reduce exposure to harmful chemicals compared to conventional cigarettes and show attenuated inflammatory responses compared to cigarette smoke, yet independent research studies indicate exposure to IQOS is still associated with negative health outcomes similar to conventional cigarettes. Clinical data is needed to understand the respiratory health impacts of IQOS use in people who currently smoke cigarettes. METHODS: Adults located in Los Angeles, California were recruited for the Adult IQOS Respiratory Study (AIRS, N = 32; 21-65 years). Nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) and saliva collected from adults who were willing to incorporate IQOS into their daily habits, were analyzed by multiplex enzyme linked immunosorbent assays for 29 different inflammatory markers or cotinine, respectively. Repeated measures ANOVA were used to identify changes in immune markers across the weekly visits. Linear mixed modelling was used to identify changes in participant cigarette or IQOS HeetStick use over the study period. Day was added as a fixed effect. RESULTS: Between-participants variability in IQOS or cigarette usage was identified (p < 0.0001). IQOS and cigarette use did not significantly change across time and remained stable over the course of the 4-week study period. No significant changes were identified in soluble protein mediators across each week. Cotinine concentrations remained consistent, even when disaggregated by sex and visit. CONCLUSIONS: All together, these data highlight that dual product use may be more likely in individuals who smoke cigarettes, particularly over the first month of incorporation, rather than completely switching to IQOS products when provided. Furthermore, incorporating IQOS did not significantly change nicotine exposure or nasal inflammatory biomarkers, suggesting, at least with nicotine exposure and nasal inflammation, that addition of heated tobacco products may not substantially reduce harm. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC: Heated tobacco products are marketed as less harmful and smoke-free alternative products compared to conventional cigarettes; however, lack of respiratory data and contradictory reports suggest they may still pose risks and use may contribute to consequential health impacts. Short-term and industry sponsored studies are available, but limited clinical data exists on the respiratory and immunological impacts of IQOS product use. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In the follow repeated measures study, our findings provide clinical evidence there are no significant differences in nasal immune biomarkers in individuals that smoke, who incorporate IQOS into their lifestyles. While each participant varied in their IQOS and cigarette product use, no significant trends were observed over the four-week sampling period in overall IQOS or cigarette use. Additionally, when participants were provided with the IQOS option, they were more inclined to dual use both products rather than switch from cigarettes to only IQOS use in the 4 week period studied. HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH PRACTICE OR POLICY: The following clinical study suggests there is an increased likelihood of dual use among individuals who are provided alternative tobacco products. Additional studies should consider evaluating health differences, including immunological markers, between individuals who dual use IQOS and other tobacco products, exclusively use IQOS, people who completely switch their product use and people who quit altogether to establish whether IQOS use reduces harmful exposures resulting in differential inflammatory responses when compared to cigarette use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,No,

I build on Thornton's analysis of club culture to characterize the subcultural vape industry as a community of taste built round a masculine aesthetic and a commitment to authenticity and DIY practice. Its attachment to complex systems and masculine spaces risked excluding customers without specialist knowledge or interest. The mainstream industry included tobacco companies which promoted vaping as a complementary category to smoking, linking their own vaping products to historic meanings of the cigarette as a lifestyle product. This task was hampered by the toxic legacy of combusted tobacco and its increasing reversion to a generic category rather than a branded product. Finally, the success of the price-focused vaping industry has been largely overlooked, but suggests that for most consumers, electronic cigarettes are still a contrasting category to combusted tobacco and are purchased largely on price. I conclude that the exclusion of a feminized, classed ""other"" is a defining element of subcultural formation, itself an overwhelmingly male mechanism of group identity construction.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

This study sought to explore these challenges and identify priorities for policy and practice. METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 31 individuals working in tobacco- and/or nicotine-related research, policy and practice in Australia. Interviewees were tobacco control and cessation advocates, researchers, public servants and health practitioners representing a range of government and non-government organisations. RESULTS: Commonly reported challenges included e-cigarettes distracting from evidence-based reform, lack of government investment, a misperception that tobacco control is 'done' and tobacco industry interference. Advocating for tobacco control to be high on political agendas, sustained investment in evidence-based measures, improved support for cessation and addressing industry interference were considered important means of addressing these challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Several challenges are perceived to be hampering Australia's tobacco control efforts. The attention being devoted to e-cigarettes at the expense of effective control measures warrants immediate addressing. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH: Increasing awareness that smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable death, developing an evidence-based national cessation strategy and implementing measures that protect tobacco control efforts from vested interests are critical to reducing smoking prevalence rates.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The co-occurrence of ADHD and SUDs/nicotine dependence may in part be mediated by shared genetic liability. Several neurobiological pathways have been implicated in both ADHD and SUDs, including dopamine and serotonin pathways. We hypothesized that variations in dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission genes were involved in the genetic liability to develop SUDs/nicotine dependence in ADHD. The current study included participants with ADHD (n = 280) who were originally part of the Dutch International Multicenter ADHD Genetics study. Participants were aged 5-15 years and attending outpatient clinics at enrollment in the study. Diagnoses of ADHD, SUDs, nicotine dependence, age of first nicotine and substance use, and alcohol use severity were based on semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Genetic risk scores were created for both serotonergic and dopaminergic risk genes previously shown to be associated with ADHD and SUDs and/or nicotine dependence. The serotonin genetic risk score significantly predicted alcohol use severity. No significant serotonin × dopamine risk score or effect of stimulant medication was found. The current study adds to the literature by providing insight into genetic underpinnings of the co-morbidity of ADHD and SUDs. While the focus of the literature so far has been mostly on dopamine, our study suggests that serotonin may also play a role in the relationship between these disorders.",['Nicotine/NRT'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,No,

CYP2A6 is responsible for nicotine's metabolic inactivation and variation in the NMR/CYP2A6 is associated with several smoking behaviors. Our aim was to integrate established alleles and novel genome-wide association studies (GWAS) signals to create a weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) for the CYP2A6 gene for European-ancestry populations. The wGRS was compared with a previous CYP2A6 gene scoring approach designed for an alternative phenotype (C2/N2; cotinine-d2/(nicotine-d2 + cotinine-d2)). CYP2A6 genotypes and the NMR were assessed in European-ancestry participants. The wGRS training set included N = 933 smokers recruited to the Pharmacogenetics of Nicotine Addiction and Treatment clinical trial [NCT01314001]. The replication cohort included N = 196 smokers recruited to the Quit 2 Live clinical trial [NCT01836276]. Comparisons between the two CYP2A6 phenotypes and with fractional clearance were made in a laboratory-based pharmacokinetic study (N = 92 participants). In both the training and replication sets, the wGRS, which included seven CYP2A6 variants, explained 33.8% (P < 0.001) of the variance in NMR, providing improved predictive power to the NMR phenotype when compared with other CYP2A6 gene scoring approaches. NMR and C2/N2 were strongly correlated to nicotine clearance (ρ = 0.70 and ρ = 0.79, respectively; P < 0.001), and to one another (ρ = 0.82; P < 0.001); however reduced function genotypes occurred in slow NMR but throughout C2/N2. The wGRS was able to predict smoking quantity and nicotine intake, to discriminate between NMR slow and normal metabolizers (AUC = 0.79; P < 0.001), and to replicate previous NMR-stratified cessation outcomes showing unique treatment outcomes between metabolizer groups.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Twin studies reveal shared genetic variance between liabilities to eating disorders and substance use, with the strongest associations between symptoms of bulimia nervosa and problem alcohol use (genetic correlation [rg ], twin-based = 0.23-0.53). We estimated the genetic correlation between eating disorder and substance use and disorder phenotypes using data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Four eating disorder phenotypes (anorexia nervosa [AN], AN with binge eating, AN without binge eating, and a bulimia nervosa factor score), and eight substance-use-related phenotypes (drinks per week, alcohol use disorder [AUD], smoking initiation, current smoking, cigarettes per day, nicotine dependence, cannabis initiation, and cannabis use disorder) from eight studies were included. Significant genetic correlations were adjusted for variants associated with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Total study sample sizes per phenotype ranged from ~2400 to ~537 000 individuals. We used linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic correlations between eating disorder- and substance-use-related phenotypes. Significant positive genetic associations emerged between AUD and AN (rg = 0.18; false discovery rate q = 0.0006), cannabis initiation and AN (rg = 0.23; q < 0.0001), and cannabis initiation and AN with binge eating (rg = 0.27; q = 0.0016). Conversely, significant negative genetic correlations were observed between three nondiagnostic smoking phenotypes (smoking initiation, current smoking, and cigarettes per day) and AN without binge eating (rgs = -0.19 to -0.23; qs < 0.04). The genetic correlation between AUD and AN was no longer significant after co-varying for major depressive disorder loci. The patterns of association between eating disorder- and substance-use-related phenotypes highlights the potentially complex and substance-specific relationships among these behaviors.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Little is known about CHRNA5-A3-B4 and its association with smoking behaviors and weight in Alaska Native people, which is a population with high prevalence but low levels of tobacco consumption, extensive smokeless tobacco use and high rates of obesity. We investigated CHRNA5-A3-B4 haplotype structure and its association with nicotine intake and obesity in Alaska Native people. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study of 400 Alaska Native individuals, including 290 tobacco users. MEASUREMENTS: CHRNA5-A3-B4 genotype, body weight and tobacco consumption biomarkers such as plasma cotinine and urinary total nicotine equivalents (TNE). FINDINGS: Alaska Native people have a distinct CHRNA5-A3-B4 haplotype structure compared with European/African Americans. In 290 Alaska Native tobacco users the 'G' allele of rs578776, which tagged a 30 kb haplotype in CHRNA5-A3-B4, was prevalent (16%) and associated significantly with nicotine intake (20% higher plasma cotinine, P < 0.001, 16% higher TNE, P = 0.076), while rs16969968 was not associated with nicotine intake. Rs578776 acted in combination with CYP2A6, the main nicotine-metabolizing enzyme, to increase nicotine intake by 1.8-fold compared with the low-risk group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, rs2869950, a single nucleotide polymorphism 5' to CHRNB4, was associated significantly with increased body mass index (P < 0.01) in the tobacco users even after controlling for differences in nicotine intake (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants in CHRNA5-A3-B4 alter nicotine intake and body mass index in a population of Alaska Native people, who have a distinct haplotype structure, smoking behaviors and prevalence of obesity.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Studies were identified by systematic database searches and screening references to February 2014. RESULTS: EC aerosol can contain some of the toxicants present in tobacco smoke, but at levels which are much lower. Long-term health effects of EC use are unknown but compared with cigarettes, EC are likely to be much less, if at all, harmful to users or bystanders. EC are increasingly popular among smokers, but to date there is no evidence of regular use by never-smokers or by non-smoking children. EC enable some users to reduce or quit smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Allowing EC to compete with cigarettes in the market-place might decrease smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Regulating EC as strictly as cigarettes, or even more strictly as some regulators propose, is not warranted on current evidence. Health professionals may consider advising smokers unable or unwilling to quit through other routes to switch to EC as a safer alternative to smoking and a possible pathway to complete cessation of nicotine use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: A nationally representative sample of adult smokers in the United States interviewed as part of the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey between 2004 and 2011. Primary analyses used cross-sectional data from 1737 smokers who attempted to quit (∼450 per wave). MEASUREMENTS: Reporting an attempt to quit smoking; use of each of the following types of SSMs for the purpose of quitting smoking: nicotine gum, nicotine patch, other nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion and varenicline. FINDINGS: There was a significant increase in the rate of use of any SSM among quit attempters across the study period [odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-1.21 per year]. This increase was largest after varenicline was introduced (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.07-1.26 per year); however, there was a decline in nicotine patch use during this time (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.76-0.99 per year). Varenicline users were generally similar to users of other SSMs but differed from those who did not use any SSMs, in that they tended to be older (OR = 5.46, P = 0.024), to be white (OR = 2.33, P = 0.002), to have high incomes (OR = 1.85, P = 0.005), to have high nicotine dependence prior to quitting (OR = 2.40, P = 0.001) and to have used medication in the past (OR = 3.29, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of varenicline in the United States coincided with a net increase in attempts to quit smoking and, among these, a net increase in use of stop-smoking medications. The demographic profile of varenicline users is similar to the profile of those who use other stop-smoking medications and different from the profile of those who attempt to quit without any medication.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

DESIGN: Advertisements for two leading e-cigarette brands were edited to contain a warning statement about product ingredients or about the tobacco industry. Participants were assigned randomly to one of eight treatments or one of two brand-specific control conditions without any warning statement. PARTICIPANTS: Young adults (n=900, aged 18-34 years) in a web panel were recruited from three groups: recent e-cigarette users, current smokers who used combustible cigarettes exclusively and non-users of either product. MEASUREMENTS: Craving and risk perceptions (addictiveness, harmful to health in general, harmful to others) were measured separately for e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes. The Juster scale measured intention to purchase e-cigarettes. FINDINGS: Exposure to both types of warnings was associated with lower craving for e-cigarettes among e-cigarette users and smokers who experienced any craving (P<0.01) and lower intention to purchase among all participants (P<0.001). Only exposure to ingredient-themed warnings was associated with lower craving for combustible cigarettes (P<0.05). Participants who saw industry-themed warnings reported greater perceptions of general harm (P<0.001), but also rated e-cigarettes as less addictive than the control conditions (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The addition of ingredient- or industry-themed warning statements to e-cigarette television advertising similarly reduces craving and purchase intent for e-cigarettes, but has inconsistent effects on perceived risks.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The work of the tobacco section of ARU paved the way to a better understanding of tobacco dependence and to developing nicotine replacement treatments. Michael Russell pioneered the idea of attractive nicotine replacement products with an acceptable safety profile replacing cigarettes on the open market and ending the tobacco epidemic, envisaging a transition from medicinal and temporary 'nicotine replacement' to recreational and potentially permanent 'smoking replacement'. Mike's prediction that the pharmaceutical industry would develop such devices did not materialize. Instead, two such products were generated by the tobacco industry (snus) and independent developers (electronic cigarettes). Another of Mike's hopes was that regulators would adopt rational policies, and that tobacco control activists would become supportive of smoking replacement once they thought through the implications. Until now, the 'smoking replacement' idea has been met with vigorous opposition from some tobacco control activists. The voices of researchers with historical links to ARU are prominent in arguing in favour of harm reduction and e-cigarettes. The most important debate ever to occur in tobacco control is under way and it carries the signature of Griffith Edwards' ARU.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The primary aim of this study was to determine whether following 7 months of smoking very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNC), and then returning to their own cigarettes, smokers would demonstrate persistently reduced nicotine intake compared with baseline or quit smoking. METHODS: In a community-based clinic 135 smokers not interested in quitting were randomized to one of two groups. A research group smoked their usual brand of cigarettes, followed by five types of research cigarettes with progressively lower nicotine content, each for 1 month, followed by 6 months at the lowest nicotine level (0.5 mg/cigarette) (53 subjects) and then 12 months with no intervention (30 subjects completed). A control group smoked their usual brand for the same period of time (50 subjects at 6 months, 38 completed). Smoking behavior, biomarkers of nicotine intake and smoke toxicant exposure were measured. RESULTS: After 7 months smoking VLNC, nicotine intake remained below baseline (plasma cotinine 149 versus 250 ng/ml, P<0.005) with no significant change in cigarettes per day or expired carbon monoxide (CO). During the 12-month follow-up, cotinine levels in RNC smokers rose to baseline levels and to those of control smokers. Quit rates among RNC smokers were very low [7.5 versus 2% in controls, not significant). CONCLUSIONS: In smokers not interested in quitting, reducing the nicotine content in cigarettes over 12 months does not appear to result in extinction of nicotine dependence, assessed by persistently reduced nicotine intake or quitting smoking over the subsequent 12 months.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Some public health experts regard them as an effective smoking cessation aid and a vital means of reducing active and passive smoking, while others regard them as another attempt by the tobacco industry to create new customers and addicts. These different attitudes unsurprisingly yield different conclusions regarding both the appropriate regulation of e-cigarettes and the ethical status of research funded by, or conducted in, cooperation with the tobacco industry. AIM: This paper examines whether e-cigarette research linked to the tobacco industry should be regarded as an exception to the rule that tobacco industry research is so tainted by conflicts of interest that journals should refuse to publish them, or at the very least treat them as a special case for scrutiny. RESULTS: Despite the fact that e-cigarettes can be used for smoking cessation, most of the conflicts of interest that apply to other tobacco research also apply to e-cigarette research linked to that industry.

MEASUREMENTS: Plasma nicotine was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) and nicotine, VG and PG in e-liquids and gas traps were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Heart rate changes and subjective effects were assessed. FINDINGS: E-cigarettes delivered an average of 1.33 (0.87-1.79) mg [mean and 95% confidence interval (CI)] of nicotine, and 93.8% of the inhaled dose, 1.22 (0.80-1.66) was systemically retained.

METHOD: We searched Embase, Medline, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception to 1 December 2014 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English. We included all studies of smokers with SMI (including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, delusional disorder and depressive psychoses) who were motivated to quit smoking. Pharmacotherapies included nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion and varenicline delivered as monotherapy or in combination compared with each other or placebo. The efficacy outcome was self-reported sustained smoking cessation, verified biochemically at the longest reported time-point. The tolerability outcome was number of patients discontinuing the trial due to any adverse event. RESULTS: Seventeen study reports were included, which represented 14 individual RCTs. No trials were found in patients with depressive psychoses, delusional disorder or that compared NRT monotherapy with placebo. A total of 356 and 423 participants were included in the efficacy and tolerability analyses, respectively. From the network meta-analysis, both bupropion and varenicline were more effective than placebo [odds ratio (OR) = 4.51, 95% credible interval (CrI) = 1.45-14.04 and OR = 5.17, 95% CrI = 1.78-15.06, respectively]. Data were insensitive to an assessment of varenicline versus bupropion (OR = 1.15, 95% CrI = 0.24-5.45). There were no significant differences in tolerability.

Considerable controversy has accompanied their marketing and use. We propose a framework that describes and incorporates patterns of VNP and combustible cigarette use in determining the total amount of toxic exposure effects on population health. We begin by considering toxicity and the outcomes relevant to population health. We then present the framework and define different measures of VNP use; namely, trial and long-term use for exclusive cigarette smokers, exclusive VNP and dual (cigarette and VNP) use. Using a systems thinking framework and decision theory we considered potential pathways for current, former and never users of VNPs. We then consider the evidence to date and the probable impacts of VNP use on public health, the potential effects of different policy approaches and the possible influence of the tobacco industry on VNP and cigarette use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Our aims were to measure non-compliance biochemically with urine cotinine (COT) and total nicotine equivalents (TNEs), compare with self-reported non-compliance and identify associated covariates. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a double-blind, parallel, randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Research centers from the United States, enrolling participants from June 2013 to July 2014. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer sample of 242 participants (55% Caucasian), average age of 41.2 years, smoking at least five cigarettes per day (CPD). INTERVENTION: Smoking very low nicotine cigarettes (VLNCs; 0.4 mg nicotine/g tobacco) for 6 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was biochemically verified non-compliance, measured as thresholds of COT/CPD and TNE/CPD ratios, considering changes in nicotine content from conventional levels to VLNCs, and as an absolute threshold of week 6 TNEs. Self-reported non-compliance was measured via daily phone calls. Key predictors included age, sex, race, menthol preference, nicotine metabolite ratio, time to first cigarette, dependence, CPD, TNEs, tar level and cigarette evaluation. FINDINGS: Estimates of non-compliance with smoking the VLNCs exclusively include: the biochemical ratios (both 78%), the week 6 TNE threshold (76%) and self-report (39%). Of the key covariates, age, dependence and cigarette evaluations of satisfaction were significant; for age, younger participants more likely to be non-compliant [P = 0.01; odds ratio (OR) = 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.96-0.99]. Dependence was associated significantly with self-reported non-compliance (P = 0.01; OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.06-1.55). Cigarette evaluations of satisfaction were associated significantly with non-compliance (P = 0.001; OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.61-0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Among smokers volunteering to smoke only very low nicotine cigarettes for 6 weeks, non-compliance was common and biochemical assessments detected more cases of non-compliance than self-report. Despite high levels of non-compliance, smokers reduced their intake of nicotine by an average of 60%.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Due to its role in nicotine clearance, the NMR is associated with smoking behaviours and response to pharmacotherapies. The NMR is highly heritable (~80%), and on average lower in African Americans (AA) versus whites. We previously identified several reduce and loss-of-function CYP2A6 variants common in individuals of African descent. Our current aim was to identify novel genetic influences on the NMR in AA smokers using genome-wide approaches. DESIGN: Genome-wide association study (GWAS). SETTING: Multiple sites within Canada and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: AA smokers from two clinical trials: Pharmacogenetics of Nicotine Addiction Treatment (PNAT)-2 (NCT01314001; n = 504) and Kick-it-at-Swope (KIS)-3 (NCT00666978; n = 450). MEASUREMENTS: Genome-wide SNP genotyping, the NMR (phenotype) and population substructure and NMR covariates. FINDINGS: Meta-analysis revealed three independent chromosome 19 signals (rs12459249, rs111645190 and rs185430475) associated with the NMR. The top overall hit, rs12459249 (P = 1.47e-39; beta = 0.59 per C (versus T) allele, SE = 0.045), located ~9.5 kb 3' of CYP2A6, remained genome-wide significant after controlling for the common (~10% in AA) non-functional CYP2A6*17 allele. In contrast, rs111645190 and rs185430475 were not genome-wide significant when controlling for CYP2A6*17. In total, 96 signals associated with the NMR were identified; many were not found in prior NMR GWASs in individuals of European descent. The top hits were also associated with the NMR in a third cohort of AA (KIS2; n = 480). None of the hits were in UGT or OCT2 genes. CONCLUSIONS: Three independent chromosome 19 signals account for ~20% of the variability in the nicotine metabolite ratio in African American smokers. The hits identified may contribute to inter-ethnic variability in nicotine metabolism, smoking behaviours and tobacco-related disease risk.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study aimed to determine if varenicline and bupropion combination treatment would result in higher abstinence rates than varenicline alone. DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, parallel-group smoking cessation clinical trial in which participants were exposed to 12 weeks of treatment and followed for 12 months. SETTING: Hospital-based out-patient clinic in Texas, USA specializing in cancer prevention. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 385 community smokers (58.44% male) who smoked 1 pack of cigarettes/day [mean = 19.66 cigarettes/day, standard deviation (SD) = 9.45]; had average carbon monoxide (CO) of 26.43 parts per million (SD = 13.74); and were moderately dependent (Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence = 4.79; SD = 2.07). INTERVENTIONS AND COMPARATOR: Smokers were randomized in a 3 : 1 (active: Placebo) ratio to 12 weeks of treatment as follows: placebo (n = 56), varenicline (Var; n = 166), and varenicline + bupropion (Combo; n = 163). MEASUREMENTS: A priori primary outcome: prolonged abstinence at 12 months. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: 7-day point prevalence abstinence and continuous abstinence; all abstinence measures at end of treatment and 6-month follow-ups. FINDINGS: Intention-to-treat analysis: the Combo group (n = 163) failed to demonstrate superiority to the Var group (n = 166) for prolonged abstinence at 12 months [odds ratio (OR) = 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50-1.64], supported by Bayes factor = 0.06. Both the Var (OR = 6.66, 95% CI = 1.61-59.27) and Combo groups (OR = 6.06, 95% CI = 1.45-54.09) demonstrated superiority to the Placebo group (n = 56; score = 8.38, P < 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of bupropion to varenicline treatment does not appear to increase smoking abstinence rates above that of varenicline alone.

METHODS: The respondents were cigarette smokers, former smokers (quit within the previous 2 years), and at-least-weekly vapers, aged 18 years and older. Eligible cohort members from the ITC Four Country Survey (4C) were retained. New respondents were sampled by commercial firms from their panels. Where possible, ages 18-24 and vapers were oversampled. Data were collected online, and respondents were remunerated. Survey weights were calibrated to benchmarks from nationally representative surveys. RESULTS: Response rates by country for new recruits once invited ranged from 15.2 to 49.6%. Sample sizes for smokers/former smokers were 1504 in AU, 3006 in CA, 3773 in EN and 2239 in the US. Sample sizes for additional vapers were 727 in CA, 551 in EN and 494 in the US. CONCLUSION: The International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey design and data collection methods allow analyses to examine prospectively the use of cigarettes and nicotine vaping products in jurisdictions with different regulatory policies. The effects on the sampling designs and response quality of recruiting the respondents from commercial panels are mitigated by the use of demographic and geographic quotas in sampling; by quality control measures; and by the construction of survey weights taking into account smoking/vaping status, sex, age, education and geography.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The impact of NVP regulatory environment and vaping on cigarette demand is unknown. The current study aims to investigate whether or not respondents' reported cigarette demand, as measured by a hypothetical cigarette purchase task, varies with (1) smoking status, (2) vaping status or (3) NVP regulatory environment (country used as proxy). DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey data from wave 1 of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Smoking and Vaping (4CV) Survey (2016). SETTING: Australia, Canada, England and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 316 adult smokers. MEASUREMENTS: A hypothetical purchase task asked smokers to estimate how many cigarettes they would purchase for consumption in a single day across multiple cigarette prices. Responses were used to derive measures of cigarette demand. Overall sensitivity of cigarette consumption to price increases was quantified to index cigarette demand elasticity, whereas estimated consumption when cigarettes are free was used to index cigarette demand intensity. FINDINGS: A majority of the non-daily smokers had previously smoked daily (72.3%); daily vapers were more likely to be former daily smokers (89.9%) compared to non-daily vapers (70.1%) and non-vapers (69.2%) (P < 0.001). The smoking status × vaping status interaction was significant for cigarette demand intensity (F = 4.93; P = 0.007) and elasticity (F = 7.30; P = 0.001): among non-daily smokers, vapers reported greater intensity but lower elasticity (i.e. greater demand) relative to non-vapers (Ps < 0.05). Among daily smokers, daily vapers reported greater intensity relative to non-vapers (P = 0.005), but vaping status did not impact elasticity (Ps > 0.38). Intensity was higher in Australia compared with all other countries (Ps < 0.001), but elasticity did not vary by country (F = 2.15; P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: In a hypothetical purchase task, non-daily smokers showed lower price elasticity if they used e-cigarettes than if they did not, while there was no clear difference in elasticity between e-cigarette users and non-users among daily smokers or according to regulatory environment of their country with regard to e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We aimed to describe the types of NVPs used by current vapers in four countries with varying regulatory and enforcement approaches toward the marketing and sale of NVPs. METHODS: Data are from wave 1 (July-November 2016) of the ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey (4CV1), conducted among a cohort of current and former smokers, and current NVP users (n = 5147 adults; ≥ 18 years) in Australia (AU), Canada (CA), England (EN) and the United States (US) reporting either current daily, weekly or occasional NVP use. Devices were described by type, brand, voltage variability and refill capacity. Refill solutions were described by flavour and nicotine content. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were conducted on the overall sample and stratified by country. A multinomial logistic regression examined factors associated with device preference across the whole sample. RESULTS: The types of NVPs used differed by pattern of use and country. Exclusive, daily vapers were more likely to use refillable pen-shaped devices [odds ratio (OR) = 10.0] or refillable box-shaped devices (OR = 5.4) than disposable cigalike devices, when compared with other (non-daily/dual) users. Nearly all respondents reported using flavoured NVPs, fruit (28.3%) being the most common flavour. Refillable devices were the most popular: refillable box-shaped devices were more commonly reported by vapers in AU (36.8%) and US (31.4%), whereas in EN (47.4%) and CA (29.7%), vapers more often reported using refillable pen-style devices. Most users also reported that their products contained nicotine, even in CA (87.8%) and AU (91.2%), where vaping products containing nicotine were technically illegal. CONCLUSIONS: In Australia, Canada, England and the United States in 2016, refillable nicotine vaping products were the most common type of nicotine vaping products used by daily vapers. Most daily vapers reported using flavoured e-liquids/refills (with variance across countries) and most reported using products that contain nicotine, even where vaping products with nicotine were banned.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

SETTING: 2016 ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping wave 1 (4CV1) surveys conducted in the United States (n = 1159), England (n = 1269), Canada (n = 964) and Australia (n = 251). MEASUREMENTS: Current vapers were asked about the following reasons for regular NVP use: less harmful to others, social acceptance, enjoyment, use in smoke-free areas, affordability and managing smoking behaviour. Ex-vapers were asked about the following reasons for discontinuing regular NVP use: addiction concerns, affordability, negative experiences, perceived social unacceptability, safety concerns, product dissatisfaction, inconvenience, unhelpfulness for quitting, unhelpfulness for managing cravings and not needed for smoking relapse prevention. Possible correlates of NVP use and discontinuation, including smoking status, smoking/vaping frequency, quit duration (ex-smokers only), country, age and type of NVP device used, were examined using multivariate logistic regression models. FINDINGS: For current smokers, the top three reasons for current regular NVP use were: helpful for cutting down smoking (85.6%), less harmful to others (77.9%) and helpful for quitting smoking (77.4%). The top three reasons for discontinuing vaping were: not being satisfying (77.9%), unhelpfulness for cravings (63.2%), and unhelpfulness for quitting smoking (52.4%). For ex-smokers, the top three reasons for current vaping were: enjoyment (90.6%), less harmful to others (90%) and affordability (89.5%); and for discontinuing were: not needed to stay quit (77.3%), not being satisfying (49.5%) and safety concerns (44%). Reported reasons varied by user characteristics, including age, country and NVP device type. CONCLUSIONS: Regular use of nicotine vaping products is mainly motivated by its perceived benefits, especially for reducing or quitting smoking, whereas its discontinuation is motivated by perceived lack of such benefits, with some variation by user characteristics.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

We examined whether complex interactions among these characteristics could affect smokers' VNP perceptions and usage patterns. DESIGN: A within-subject randomized cross-over trial. SETTING: Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen daily cigarette smokers. MEASUREMENTS: Participants attended eight weekly visits during which they sampled six different VNPs (disposable, rechargeable, eGO, mod, e-Cigar and e-Pipe) with tobacco-flavored e-liquid. Prior to device use, participants completed product-ranking questionnaires. Participants completed controlled puffing sessions during each of the six trials, after which satisfaction questionnaires were completed and blood samples were taken. FINDINGS: Initial perceptions showed that the smallest device (disposable) was ranked as safer compared with a larger device (e-Pipe) (P < 0.05). Participants rated the eGO and mod devices higher on satisfaction and enjoyment from use, taste, pleasantness, harshness ('throat hit') and speed of effect, but lower on perceived health risk and embarrassment from use (P < 0.05). All devices had a lower Cmax than the combustible cigarette (P < 0.05), but there were differences among devices (P < 0.05). The mod, e-Pipe and eGO provided the highest amount of perceived smoking urge relief, and this correlated strongly with Cmax across all devices (R2 = 0.8614, P = 0.007). The perceived speed of urge relief was not correlated with Tmax (R2 = 0.0035, P = 0.911) CONCLUSIONS: Daily cigarette smokers testing six types of vaporized nicotine products (VNPs) reported that they varied in taste, amount of withdrawal relief, harshness, embarrassment from use, perceived health risk and subjective and objective nicotine delivery. The eGO and mod models have properties that may make them most effective for cigarette substitution among smokers who intend to switch to a VNP.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We compared indicators of prior and current cigarette smoking dependence and of relapse in former smokers who were daily users of nicotine vaping products ('vapers') or who were not vaping at the time of survey ('non-vapers'). DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey-based comparison between vaping and non-vaping former smokers, including a weighted logistic regression of vaping status onto predictor variables, adjusting for covariates specified below. SETTING: United States, Canada, Australia and England. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1070 people aged 18+ years from the 2016 International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Smoking and Vaping Wave 1 Survey who reported having ever been daily smokers but who stopped less than 2 years ago and who were currently vapers or non-vapers. MEASUREMENTS: Dependent variable was current vaping status. Predictor variables were self-reported: (1) smoking within 5 minutes of waking and usual daily cigarette consumption, both assessed retrospectively; (2) current perceived addiction to smoking, urges to smoke and confidence in staying quit. Covariates: country, sample sources, sex, age group, ethnicity, income, education, current nicotine replacement therapy use and time since quitting. FINDINGS: Vapers were more likely than non-vapers to report: (1) having smoked within 5 minutes of waking [34.3 versus 15.9%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.99, 7.03), χ2 = 16.92, P < 0.001]; having smoked > 10 cigarettes/day (74.4 versus 47.2%, aOR = 4.39, 95% CI = 2.22, 8.68), χ2 = 18.18, P < 0.001); (2) perceiving themselves to be still very addicted to smoking (41.3 versus 26.2%, aOR = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.58, 5.30, χ2 = 11.87, P < 0.001) and feeling extremely confident about staying quit (62.1 versus 36.6%, aOR = 3.22, 95% CI = 1.86, 5.59, χ2 = 17.36, P < 0.001).

The aim of the study was to test a possible effect of nausea on smoking cessation outcomes mediated by adherence. DESIGN: Mediation path analysis. SETTING: Multiple sites within Canada and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Treatment-seeking smokers receiving varenicline from two smoking cessation clinical trials: Quit2Live (NCT01836276; n = 449) and Pharmacogenetics of Nicotine Addiction Treatment (PNAT) (NCT01314001; n = 421). MEASUREMENTS: Nausea severity was collected through self-report and adherence was biologically assessed using varenicline concentrations (Quit2Live, plasma sample at week 4; PNAT, saliva sample at week 2). In Quit2Live, the end-points were cotinine-verified abstinence at weeks 4, 12 and 26. In PNAT, the end-points were carbon monoxide-verified abstinence at weeks 2, 12 and 26. FINDINGS: Early nausea was not directly associated with abstinence [odds ratio (OR) ranging from 0.73-1.28; P ≥ 0.26]. However early nausea was indirectly associated with lower cessation rates at multiple timepoints (ORs ranging from 0.92-0.94; 95% CI between 0.83-0.99) in a relationship mediated by reduced varenicline adherence (assessed by plasma varenicline concentrations) in the primary trial (Quit2Live). This relationship between nausea, adherence and cessation was similar in direction but weaker in effect size (ORs ranging from 0.98-0.99; 95% CI between 0.90-1.03) in a secondary trial (PNAT), where adherence was assessed using salivary varenicline concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that early nausea during varenicline treatment may be indirectly associated with lower likelihood of smoking cessation through reducing varenicline adherence. Differences in robustness between the trials may be due to the different biological matrices (plasma vs. saliva) and/or timing used to assess varenicline adherence. The results of the first study suggest that improved management of early nausea during varenicline treatment may positively impact smoking cessation success through increasing varenicline adherence.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

In this study, 24-hour blood plasma nicotine concentrations and 48-hour subjective effects with use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes were measured among dual users. DESIGN: Two-arm within-subject cross-over design with preferred e-cigarette or cigarette ad-libitum use over 48 hours. SETTING: Hospital research ward in San Francisco, California, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six healthy dual users of e-cigarettes and cigarettes (n = 8, 25% females). MEASUREMENTS: Twenty-four-hour blood plasma nicotine and cotinine concentrations and 48-hour self-reported nicotine withdrawal symptoms and rewarding effects. FINDINGS: Analyses used analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based mixed models with order of product (e-cigarette or cigarette) and product type (combustible cigarette or type of e-cigarette) as fixed effects, and subject as a repeated effect. During a 24-hour period, e-cigarettes produced lower nicotine exposure than cigarettes for the majority of users, although 25% received more nicotine from e-cigarettes, which was predicted by more frequent e-cigarette use or greater dependence. Compared to cigarette smoking, nicotine exposure for variable-power tank users was similar, while cig-a-like (t(30) = 2.71, P = 0.011, d = 0.745) and fixed-power tank users (t(30) = 3.37, P = 0.002, d = 0.993) were exposed to less nicotine. Cigarettes were rated higher than e-cigarettes on some desirable subjective effects (e.g. psychological reward, t(322) = 7.24 P < 0.001, d = 0.432), but withdrawal symptom reduction was comparable. No differences were found between e-cigarette types, but Bayes factors indicate that these measures were insensitive. CONCLUSIONS: During a 24-hour period in a hospital setting in the United States, nicotine exposure for dual users of e-cigarettes and cigarettes was similar when using cigarettes or variable-power tank devices only but was lower for those using cig-a-like or fixed-power devices only. Despite lower nicotine levels, all types of e-cigarette were effective in preventing withdrawal symptoms. E-cigarettes were rated less rewarding than cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study aimed to assess this association. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Republic of Korea. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 16 808 male smokers registered for the Quitline between 7 April 2006 and 31 December 2013. Of these, 13 176 participants who were > 19 years of age and provided data on their demographic characteristics, smoking-related behaviors, nicotine dependence, tobacco brands used and self-efficacy were included in this study. MEASUREMENTS: Machine-smoked nicotine yield was based on information provided by tobacco companies on cigarette packages that smokers reported as their usual brand. Ultra-low nicotine yield was defined as ≤ 0.1 mg machine-smoked nicotine yield per cigarette, whereas higher nicotine yield was defined as > 0.1 mg machine-smoked nicotine yield. Participant personal information and self-reported continuous abstinence at 1-month, 6-month and 1-year follow-up were recorded in electronic databases. FINDINGS: Continuous abstinence rates in the ultra-low nicotine yield versus higher nicotine yield groups were, respectively, 40.7 versus 34.6% at 1 month [odds ratio (OR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12-1.33], 22.7 versus 18.8% at 6 months (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.08-1.32) and 19.5 versus 16.6% (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.10-1.29) at 1 year. The association between ultra-low nicotine yield cigarette smoking and successful quitting was stronger among the smokers with higher cigarette dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Male smokers who use the Korean Quitline are more likely to quit successfully if they smoke ultra-low nicotine yield cigarettes than if they smoke higher nicotine yield cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

This study considered the potential impact of NVPs on smoking prevalence in England. DESIGN: Indirect simulation model. The England SimSmoke model is validated through 2012, before NVP use became more widely used by smokers. Because information on NVP-related transitions is limited, an indirect method is used; the difference in observed smoking prevalence (reflecting NVPs) is compared with a 2012-2019 counterfactual No-NVP scenario (without NVPs) to estimate the impact of NVPs on smoking and smoking-attributable deaths. SETTING: England, 2000-2019. PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative sample of population. MEASUREMENTS: England's population, mortality rates and smoking prevalence estimates from three national surveys and tobacco control policies. FINDINGS: Between 2000 and 2012, SimSmoke projected a decline in age 18+ smoking prevalence of 23.5% in men and 27.0% in women. These projections, as well as those by specific age groups, were generally consistent with findings from the three national surveys. Comparing 2012-2019 relative reduction in age 18+ prevalence from the Annual Population Survey (males, 27.5%) with the model-predicted No-NVP reduction (males, 7.3%), the implied NVP-attributable relative reduction in adult smoking prevalence was 20.2% (95% CI, 18.8%-22.0%) for males and 20.4% (18.7%-22.2%) for females. The NVP-attributable reduction was 27.2% (22.8%-31.6%) for males and 31.7% (27.4%-36.5%) for females ages 18-24 and 18.6% (15.2%-21.8%) for males and 15.0% (11.1%-18.8%) for females ages 25-34, with similar reductions for ages 35+. The implied reduction in smoking prevalence between 2012 and 2019 equates to 165 660 (132 453-199 501) averted deaths by 2052. Other surveys yielded smaller, but relatively consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: An indirect method of simulation modelling indicates that substantial reductions in smoking prevalence occurred in England from 2012-2019 coinciding with the growth in nicotine vaping product use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study examined the degree to which smoker age is related to making quit attempts and quit success. DESIGN: Ten waves of the International Tobacco Control Policy Cohort survey (ITC-4C) collected between 2002 and 2014, with nine wave-to-wave transitions with predictors at the first wave predicting quit attempts and success by the next wave. SETTING: Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Data from 15 874 smokers categorized into four age groups at baseline (18-24, 25-39, 40-54 and 55+ years). MEASUREMENTS: Age, quit attempts and success (defined as ≥ 30 days abstinence confirmed, if possible, on a third wave for recent attempts). FINDINGS: Older smokers were more likely to smoke daily (χ2 = 1557.86, r = 0.136, P < 0.001) than younger smokers. Daily smokers were less likely to report quit attempts (38.1 versus 58.2%) and to achieve 30 days of abstinence (22.9 versus 34.3%) than non-daily smokers. Older daily smokers were less likely to make quit attempts [0.61, confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.70, P < 0.001], even after controlling for indicators of nicotine dependence, country, sex, education, income, relationship status and household composition, than younger smokers. Younger smokers (< 25) were more likely to succeed for at least 30 days of abstinence, but only when compared with those aged 40-54 (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.68-0.99). However, when controlling for heaviness of smoking the age effect disappeared. Significant interactions with age were found between age and intention when predicting quit attempts, and age and heaviness of smoking when predicting quit success. CONCLUSIONS: An international cohort study indicates that young smokers are more likely to attempt to quit and appear to have similar levels of success in abstaining from smoking compared with older smokers when controlling for dependence. Quit success in all ages is most predicted by lower levels of nicotine dependence.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

However, few states have met their obligations under Article 14 of the FCTC to develop evidence-based policies to support tobacco cessation. This article examines how human rights obligations could provide a legal and moral basis for states to implement greater support for individuals to overcome their addiction to tobacco. ANALYSIS: The United Nations (UN) has a well-established legal framework for promoting human rights, looking to the right to health to realize health autonomy. Where addiction undermines autonomy, it is widely acknowledged that addiction presents a significant barrier to cessation for individuals who use tobacco, undermining the right to health. The UN human rights system could, therefore, provide a complementary basis for monitoring state obligations under Article 14 of the FCTC, identifying challenges to FCTC implementation and motivating states to support tobacco cessation. CONCLUSIONS: The United Nations' human rights system offers a mechanism that could be used to monitor Framework Convention on Tobacco Control implementation in national policy, facilitating accountability for the progressive realization of cessation support.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

DESIGN: Cohort study using multinomial logistic regression analyses on data from waves 1 (2016), 2 (2018) and 3 (2020) from the International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping Surveys. SETTING: Four countries with varying NVP regulatory environments: 'most restrictive' (Australia), 'somewhat restrictive' (Canada) and 'less restrictive' (England and the United States). PARTICIPANTS: Adult exclusive daily smokers who did not report NVP use at the time of their baseline survey and had visited a HP in the last 12-24 months. Prevalence data came from 4125, 4503 and 4277 respondents, respectively, for each year. Longitudinal data were from 4859 respondents who participated in at least two consecutive surveys. MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence of self-reported discussions with HPs and recommendations from HPs about NVPs. Longitudinal transitions from smoking to vaping (either exclusively or concurrently with smoking) and quitting (regardless of NVP uptake). FINDINGS: The prevalence of NVP discussions was low among countries with varying regulatory environments and study waves (range = 1.4-6.2%). In 2020, a low percentage of smokers who discussed NVPs with a HP reported that their HPs recommended they use NVPs in the United States (14.7%), Australia (20.2%), Canada (25.7%), with a higher percentage in England (55.7%) where clinical guidelines for smoking cessation include NVPs. Compared with 12.0% of smokers who reported no discussion, 37.0% of those whose HPs recommended NVPs transitioned to vaping at follow-up. Transition to quitting was 9.6% with HPs' recommendation of NVPs versus 13.5% without discussion, a non-significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: In Australia, Canada, England and the United States between 2016 and 2020, health professionals' discussions with smokers about nicotine vaping products (NVPs) were infrequent. NVP discussions were associated with NVP uptake, but not with quitting smoking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We evaluated vaping uptake and smoking cessation considering differences in smokers' plans to quit. DESIGN: Longitudinal International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Smoking and Vaping Surveys were conducted in 2016, 2018 and 2020. SETTING: This study was conducted in the United States, Canada, England and Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Participants of this study were adult daily cigarette smokers who had not vaped in the past 6 months at baseline and had participated in two or more consecutive waves of the ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Surveys (n = 2815). MEASUREMENTS: Plans to quit cigarette smoking was assessed at baseline (within 6 months, beyond 6 months, not planning to quit) and at follow-up (within 6 months vs not within 6 months), cigarette smoking cessation was assessed at follow-up (smoking less than monthly [including complete cessation] vs daily/weekly/monthly smoking) and inter-wave vaping uptake was assesed between baseline and follow-up (none, only non-daily vaping and any daily vaping). Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate whether inter-wave vaping uptake was associated with smoking cessation at follow-up and with planning to quit at follow-up, each stratified by plans to quit smoking at baseline. FINDINGS: Overall, 12.7% of smokers quit smoking. Smokers not initially planning to quit within 6 months experienced higher odds of smoking cessation when they took up daily vaping (32.4%) versus no vaping (6.8%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 8.58; 95% CI, 5.06-14.54). Among smokers planning to quit, smoking cessation rates were similar between those who did and did not take up daily vaping (25.1% vs 16.8%; AOR, 1.91; 95% CI, 0.91-4.00), although we could not account for potential use of cessation aids. Daily vaping uptake was associated with planning to quit smoking at follow-up among those initially not planning to quit (AOR,6.32; 95% CI, 4.17-9.59). CONCLUSIONS: Uptake of nicotine vaping appears to be strongly associated with cigarette smoking cessation among smokers with no initial plans to quit smoking. Excluding smokers not planning to quit from studies on vaping and smoking cessation may underestimate potential benefit of daily vaping for daily smokers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Tobacco use during pregnancy is concerning due to the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and effects on child health. Nicotine may mediate several of these effects. This systematic review measured health outcomes from Swedish smokeless tobacco (snus) use during pregnancy. METHOD: Literature search was conducted by an information specialist in May 2022. We included human studies of snus use during pregnancy compared with no tobacco use, assessed risk of bias, conducted a meta-analysis and assessed confidence in effect-estimates using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). RESULTS: We included 18 cohort studies (42 to 1 006 398 participants). Snus use during pregnancy probably (moderate confidence in risk estimates) increase the risk of neonatal apnea, adjusted odds ratio 95% confidence interval [aOR (95% CI)] 1.96 (1.30 to 2.96). Snus use during pregnancy possibly (low confidence in risk estimates) increase the risk of stillbirths aOR 1.43 (1.02 to 1.99), extremely premature births aOR 1.69 (1.17 to 2.45), moderately premature birth aOR 1.26 (1.15 to 1.38), SGA aOR 1.26 (1.09 to 1.46), reduced birth weight mean difference of 72.47 g (110.58 g to 34.35 g reduction) and oral cleft malformations aOR 1.48 (1.00 to 2.21). It is uncertain (low confidence in risk estimates, CI crossing 1) whether snus use during pregnancy affects risk of preeclampsia aOR 1.11 (0.97 to 1.28), antenatal bleeding aOR 1.15 (0.92 to 1.44) and very premature birth aOR 1.26 (0.95 to 1.66). Risk of early neonatal mortality and altered heart rate variability is uncertain, very low confidence. Snus using mothers had increased prevalence of caesarean sections, low confidence.

This analysis measured whether ENDS cessation among current and former CTP smokers is associated with changes in CTP smoking or abstinence. DESIGN: Regression analysis of a nationally representative cohort from waves 4 (W4) and 5 (W5) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study (December 2016-November 2019). SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (n = 1525) who reported W4 current or former use of ≥ 1 CTP and either currently using ENDS or quitting ENDS in the past year were included. MEASUREMENTS: Logistic regressions were performed separately among W4 current and former CTP smokers, controlling for demographic and tobacco use characteristics. First, we analyzed proximal outcomes by testing the association between ENDS quit status and CTP abstinence, both occurring during W5. Next, we analyzed long-term outcomes by testing W4 ENDS quit status as a predictor of CTP abstinence at W5, approximately 1 year later. FINDINGS: Among W4 current CTP smokers, there was no evidence that CTP smoking abstinence differed between those quitting or continuing using ENDS, both in our proximal [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.90, 2.10] and long-term (aOR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.52, 1.53) analyses. Among former CTP smokers, quitting ENDS was associated with less CTP abstinence in our proximal analysis (aOR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.20, 0.89), but there was no evidence that CTP smoking abstinence differed between those quitting or continuing using ENDS in our long-term analysis (aOR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.44, 1.67). CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that ENDS cessation is associated with CTP abstinence among current smokers, although mixed findings among former smokers indicate a possible risk for relapse to smoking associated with quitting ENDS.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

DESIGN: This was a nationally representative monthly cross-sectional survey. SETTING: The study was conducted in England, 2016-23. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6507 adults (≥ 18 years) who reported current vaping. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were asked where they usually buy their vaping products: vape shops, supermarkets/convenience stores, on-line or other sources ('other' or cheap from friends). FINDINGS: Up to 2020, vape shops were the most common source of purchase (mean monthly proportion = 43.3%), followed by supermarkets/convenience stores (29.7%) and on-line retailers (20.5%). In 2020, these purchasing patterns shifted: on-line purchasing increased and vape-shop purchasing fell. The rise in on-line purchasing was short-lived, peaking at 33.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 31.0-36.5%] in July 2021, and soon returned to baseline levels. However, the fall in vape-shop purchasing persisted, remaining below 31% from July 2021 onwards, displaced by a rapid rise in purchasing from supermarkets and convenience stores from 31.6% (95% CI = 29.6-33.7%) in January 2021 to 48.5% (95% CI = 42.9-54.8%) by April 2023.

This study evaluated how adult consumers compare the costs between NVPs and cigarettes. METHOD: We used data from the US arm of the 2016-2020 International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping (ITC 4CV) surveys to perform a multinomial logit model with two-way fixed effects to measure how perceived cost comparisons are associated with NVP and cigarette taxes, use patterns, NVP device types and individual sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: Higher cigarette taxes are associated with a greater likelihood of perceiving NVPs and cigarettes as costing the same for the overall population and among people who exclusively smoke, and a lower likelihood of perceiving NVPs as more expensive among people who exclusively vape, compared with lower cigarette taxes. Pre-filled cartridge and tank users are more likely to perceive NVPs as less expensive than cigarettes, compared with people who use other types of NVPs. The associations between taxes and perceived cost comparison were more pronounced among males, younger and low-income populations. CONCLUSIONS: Higher cigarette taxes are associated with perceived financial incentives for nicotine vaping products (NVPs) over cigarettes, whereas NVP taxes are not associated with perceived cost comparison between NVPs and cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Of those surveyed in 2022-2024 in Great Britain, overall, 89.5% (CI = 88.1-90.8) said they usually used e-cigarettes containing nicotine, 8.7% (CI = 7.5-10.0) used nicotine-free e-cigarettes, and 1.8% (CI = 1.2-2.4) were unsure. The proportion using ≥20 mg/ml was higher among those mainly using disposable (47.9%) compared with pod (16.3%) or refillable (11.5%) devices; never smokers (36.0%), current smokers (28.8%) or recent (<1y) ex-smokers (27.4%), compared with long-term ex-smokers (13.9%); and younger (16-24y; 44.2%) compared with older (≥25y; range 9.4-25.1%) age groups. There were no notable differences across other subgroups of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Use of high-strength nicotine e-liquids in England appears to have increased sharply in recent years. Most adult vapers in Great Britain appear to use e-cigarettes that contain nicotine but different subgroups use different strengths: nicotine strengths tend to be higher among those who mainly use disposable devices and those aged 16-24y, and lower among long-term ex-smokers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We investigated the relationship between tobacco tax increases and PMBs, measuring whether PMBs intensify following tax increases, whether low-income consumers with higher nicotine dependence are more likely to engage in PMBs and whether PMBs are negatively related to smoking cessation. METHOD: This was a systematic review with meta-analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies from seven databases up to March 2023, using studies that reported any product- and purchasing-related smoking behaviours post-tobacco tax increase in a general representative population. Sixty-eight studies were quality-assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. All studies were narratively synthesized, with five studies involving 13 068-26 575 participants providing data for pooled analyses on PMBs [purchasing lower-priced brands, roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco and cartons] pre- and post-tax increases using a random effects meta-analytical model. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies reported on legal PMBs, and 17 studies reported illicit cigarette purchasing. Meta-analysis showed that consecutive tax increases were positively associated with purchasing RYO [odds ratio (OR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-2.46], especially in higher tobacco taxing environments, with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 96%). Lower income and higher nicotine dependence were associated with purchasing lower-priced brands and RYO, whereas higher income and nicotine dependence were associated with purchasing cartons, large-sized packs and cross-border sales. Less evidence associated illicit tobacco purchases with tax increases or PMBs with smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco purchasers' PMBs vary widely by state, country and time-period within countries. Both legal and illegal PMBs, potentially influenced by industry pricing tactics, may exacerbate health inequalities and dilute the public health benefits of tobacco tax increases.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DESIGN: Randomized, parallel group, double-blind trial. SETTING: Single site at Hammersmith Medicines Research Ltd (HMR), London, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 216 (25.9% females, average age 27.6 ± 7.63 [standard deviation, SD]) exclusive vapers who used their e-cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up and had vaped about 2 years on average. INTERVENTIONS: Two sprays of 1 mg nicotine mouth spray (Nicorette QuickMist Freshmint, n = 109), or placebo (identical in appearance and presentation, n = 107). MEASUREMENTS: Urge to vape was rated on a 100 mm visual analogue scale before and repeatedly for 2 hours after administration. The primary outcome measured average change from baseline in urges to vape ratings during the first hour. FINDINGS: Nicotine mouth spray achieved statistically significantly greater reductions in urges to vape than placebo from the first assessment point at 30 seconds to 1 hour, when the estimated mean treatment difference was 11.90 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.86-16.95, P < 0.001). The integrated urge to vape over 11 hours ad libitum usage showed a statistically significant benefit compared with placebo (2.00 [0.88 SD] vs 2.51 [0.84 SD], P < 0.001). Mean steady-state plasma nicotine concentrations were lower after nicotine mouth spray usage compared with vaping (6.22 [4.70 SD] ng/ml vs 9.91 [7.59 SD] ng/ml, respectively). Adverse events were more commonly reported in the nicotine mouth spray group and were mostly mild. CONCLUSIONS: Among regular e-cigarette users, nicotine mouth spray provided statistically significant and fast relief of urges to vape one hour after dosing. Nicotine mouth spray showed statistically significant reductions in urges to vape as soon as 30 seconds and up to 2 hours after dosing compared with placebo, and nicotine mouth spray was well-tolerated and safe.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study measured how the prevalence and patterns of smoking and vaping ('dual use') in England have changed as the vaping market has rapidly evolved. DESIGN: Representative monthly cross-sectional survey, July 2016 to April 2024. SETTING: England. PARTICIPANTS: 128 588 adults (≥18y). MEASUREMENTS: Logistic regression estimated associations between survey wave and dual use. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse patterns of smoking and vaping, overall and by sociodemographic, smoking and vaping characteristics and harm perceptions of e-cigarettes vs. cigarettes. FINDINGS: Across the period, the overall prevalence of dual use increased non-linearly from 3.5% to 5.2% of adults [prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.49 (1.25-1.76)]. Among adults who smoked, the proportion who also vaped was relatively stable up to mid-2021, at an average of 18.6% between July 2016 and May 2021, then increased rapidly to 34.2% by April 2024 [PR = 1.76 (1.48-2.09)]. This increase was greatest at younger ages [e.g. from 19.6% to 59.4% among 18- to 24-year-olds; PR = 3.04 (2.28-4.23)]. The most common pattern of dual use across the period was daily cigarette smoking with daily vaping [49.0% (47.3-50.8%)]. Over time, the proportion of dual users reporting daily cigarette smoking with non-daily vaping decreased [from 35.2% to 15.0%; PR = 0.43 (0.29-0.63)], offset primarily by an increase in the proportion reporting non-daily cigarette smoking with daily vaping [from 7.6% to 21.5%; PR = 2.84 (1.71-4.72)]. Daily cigarette smoking with daily vaping was more common (and non-daily cigarette smoking with daily vaping less common) among dual users who were older, less advantaged, mainly smoked hand-rolled cigarettes, had stronger urges to smoke and had been vaping for ≤6 months. Daily vaping was more common among dual users who thought e-cigarettes were less/equally harmful as cigarettes, or were unsure. CONCLUSIONS: In England, vaping prevalence has increased rapidly among adults who smoke since 2021, which was when disposable e-cigarettes started to become popular. Since 2016, patterns of dual use have shifted away from more frequent smoking towards more frequent vaping. This may be the result of increasing prevalence of dual use among younger adults, who are more likely than older dual users to smoke non-daily and vape daily.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Systematic review with association direction plots (searches to April 2023). Screening, data extraction and critical appraisal followed Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was the association between e-cigarette use, availability or both, and change in population rate of smoking in young people. The secondary outcomes were initiation, progression and cessation of smoking at individual level. We assessed certainty using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). RESULTS: We included 126 studies. For our primary outcome, there was very low certainty evidence (limited by risk of bias and inconsistency) suggesting that e-cigarette use and availability were inversely associated with smoking in young people (i.e. as e-cigarettes became more available and/or used more widely, youth smoking rates went down or, conversely, as e-cigarettes were restricted, youth smoking rates went up). All secondary outcomes were judged to be very low certainty due to very serious risk of bias. Data consistently showed direct associations between vaping at baseline and smoking initiation (28 studies) and smoking progression (5 studies). The four studies contributing data on smoking cessation had mixed results, precluding drawing any conclusion on the direction of association. There was limited information to determine whether relationships varied by sociodemographic characteristics. CONCLUSION: At an individual level, people who vape appear to be more likely to go on to smoke than people who do not vape; however, it is unclear if these behaviours are causally linked. Very low certainty evidence suggests that youth vaping and smoking could be inversely related.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Rigorous evidence mapping and synthesis have highlighted gaps and methodological concerns in the evidence base. This study provides recommendations for the conduct and reporting of future quantitative primary research exploring e-cigarette use and later cigarette smoking in young people (≤29 years). METHODS: We developed a draft version of recommendations based on the critical appraisal of studies, findings of a systematic review and an evidence and gap map. We used an anonymized on-line survey to run a consultation exercise with stakeholders, including researchers, non-profit/charity workers and clinicians. Respondents rated the perceived importance of each draft recommendation on a 5-point Likert scale and provided open-ended comments, where relevant. We developed a final set of recommendations based on this stakeholder input. RESULTS: We initially came up with a list of 22 recommendations, which 36 stakeholders rated in the on-line survey. Most were researchers (n = 26) and from the USA (n = 18). Following feedback, this resulted in a final set of 23 recommendations, including recommendations for planning, data collection, data analysis and reporting. Examining causes of differences in vaping-smoking associations, including equity factors (e.g. socioeconomic status) and contextual factors (e.g. jurisdiction levels), and generating representative longitudinal data from countries other than the USA, Canada and UK, particularly low- and middle-income countries, were strongly endorsed recommendations. A new recommendation to report characteristics of e-cigarettes (e.g. flavours) was added. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides 23 recommendations for conducting and reporting future quantitative research exploring e-cigarette use/availability and later combustible cigarette smoking in young people. Most of the recommendations are specific to studies using repeat cross-sectional data tracking population trends and to longitudinal cohort studies tracking behaviours in individuals.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Fewer threats of litigation facing the US smokeless tobacco (SLT) industry may have contributed to the sponsorship of independent research on SLT use and health outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether the SLT industry used cigarette industry strategies to manipulate research on health risks. METHODS: Internal industry documents (e.g. letters, memos) from the 1970s through 1990s were accessed through the online Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library at the University of California, San Francisco. A framework of tobacco industry strategies and criteria for evaluating sponsored research formed the basis for categorizing and synthesizing documents identified via snowball sampling (n = 177). Summaries of awarded projects in annual reports of the Smokeless Tobacco Research Council (STRC) were coded for content (n = 189, 1982-1997). RESULTS: Guided by legal counsel, the SLT industry sponsored research to support its interest group position; advocated against research on tobacco-specific carcinogens such as N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN); heavily criticized a case-control study on oropharyngeal cancer; and relied on a cadre of grantees and STRC leadership to testify against SLT restrictions. The STRC awarded a high proportion of projects on nicotine (78/189), including use for therapy (e.g. Tourette's syndrome), but underfunded epidemiologic research (n = 3). However, the STRC awarded projects on extracts or constituents (e.g. NNN, n = 30) that may have implicated SLT's role in carcinogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: While the Smokeless Tobacco Research Council awarded some research that may have weakened the industry, the Council's imbalanced portfolio of projects and inextricable link to industry likely favored the interest group position. Thus, we cannot conclude that the smokeless tobacco industry sponsored research solely for scientific discovery. Greater independence of industry-sponsored research could be achieved by delegating scientific decision-making to scientists (not legal counsel), limiting governance to those unaffiliated with the industry sponsor and not relying on grantees to defend the interest group position.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In January 2024, the government announced plans to introduce new vaping policies, including a ban on disposable vapes, to tackle youth vaping. This study measured whether trends in current vaping and use of disposable vapes have changed since this announcement. METHODS: Segmented regression analysis of data collected monthly between January 2022 and January 2025 as part of the Smoking Toolkit Study, a representative household survey in Great Britain. We ran generalised additive models using data from all participants aged ≥16y (n = 88 611; 'adults') and from a subset aged 16-24y (n = 9276; 'young adults'). Main outcome measures were changes in trends in (a) the prevalence of current vaping and (b) the proportion of vapers mainly using disposable devices. RESULTS: Before January 2024, vaping prevalence was increasing by 23.4% per year [relative risk (RR)trend = 1.234, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.184-1.287] and use of disposable vapes was increasing by 17.7% per year (RRtrend = 1.177, 95% CI = 1.105-1.255). These trends changed after the new policy measures were announced (RRΔtrend = 0.782, 95% CI = 0.696-0.878, and RRΔtrend = 0.573, 95% CI = 0.487-0.673, respectively). Instead of increasing, vaping prevalence stabilised and there was a substantial decline in the proportion of vapers mainly using disposables from 43.6% (40.1-47.3%) in January 2024 to 29.4% (26.3-32.9%) in January 2025. Similar changes were observed among young adults (vaping prevalence: RRΔtrend = 0.799, 95% CI = 0.645-0.990; use of disposable vapes: RRΔtrend = 0.547, 95% CI = 0.435-0.688), with vaping prevalence stabilising between January 2024 and January 2025 and the proportion of vapers mainly using disposables falling from 63.2% (58.8-67.8%) to 35.2% (30.4-40.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Following the announcement of an impending ban on disposable vapes and other potential vaping policies, recent increases in vaping prevalence in Great Britain stalled, including among young adults. In addition, there was a shift away from using disposable vapes, with people increasingly opting to use devices that can be refilled and recharged.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Smoking prevalence in this group has remained largely unchanged, highlighting a major public health concern. This protocol outlines a trial aimed at addressing this issue by evaluating the effectiveness of offering an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) starter kit for smoking cessation and harm reduction as an adjunct to usual care to adults who smoke with mental illness treated in the community. DESIGN: Two-arm parallel randomized controlled superiority trial. SETTING: A minimum of eleven UK National Health Service mental health Trusts or general practices. PARTICIPANTS: Adults who smoke with a diagnosis of mental illness treated in the community. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomly allocated (1 : 1) to receive: (i) an e-cigarette starter kit, a brief demonstration and both verbal and written information on e-cigarette use as an adjunct to usual care; or (ii) usual care alone. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome is 7-day point prevalence carbon monoxide-validated abstinence, assessed six months after study enrolment or target quit date.

This study aimed to measure changes in the proportion of US high-school students reporting symptoms of nicotine dependence over the past decade, in the context of changing patterns of nicotine product use. DESIGN: Repeat cross-sectional analyses of the 2014-2023 National Youth Tobacco Surveys. SETTING: United States of America. PARTICIPANTS: 107 968 high-school students (14-18y). MEASUREMENTS: Nicotine product use was categorised based on self-reported past-30-day use of cigarettes, other combustible tobacco, smokeless/non-combustible products and e-cigarettes. Nicotine dependence was operationalised as (a) strong past-30-day cravings to use tobacco and (b) wanting to use nicotine products within 30 minutes of waking. FINDINGS: Past-30-day use of any nicotine product decreased from 24.5% (95% confidence interval = 22.5%-26.6%) to 19.6% (16.8%-22.4%) between 2014 and 2017, increased sharply, reaching 31.4% (29.0%-33.7%) in 2019 (driven by an increase in e-cigarette use), then fell to the lowest level at 12.5% (10.9%-14.1%) by 2023. The proportion who reported symptoms of nicotine dependence was substantially lower, but followed a similar pattern of changes over time. For example, the proportion reporting strong cravings decreased from 7.8% (6.6%-9.0%) to 5.5% (4.3%-6.7%) between 2014 and 2017, increased to 7.9% (6.8%-9.0%) between 2017 and 2018 and remained stable up to 2020, then fell to the lowest level at 2.5% (1.9%-3.1%) by 2023. While dependence symptoms were consistently highest among cigarette users, they were increasingly prevalent among those using only e-cigarettes after 2017. CONCLUSIONS: The sharp rise in the prevalence of nicotine product use (in particular, e-cigarettes) among US high-school students in the late 2010s was short-lived and was not accompanied by a sustained increase in the overall population burden of nicotine dependence. By 2023, both nicotine product use and nicotine dependence had reached historic lows. However, dependence symptoms increased over time among those using e-cigarettes only.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

This study aimed to examine whether motivation to stop smoking differs between those who smoke cigarettes daily vs. non-daily, and to explore differences in this association by relevant sociodemographic, smoking and vaping-related factors. DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational study using data drawn from the Smoking Toolkit Study, a representative cross-sectional survey in England, 2021-2024. PARTICIPANTS: 13 277 cigarette smokers (≥16 y). MEASURES: Outcome variables were level of motivation to stop smoking (Motivation to Stop Scale), analysed as a 7-level ordinal variable and dichotomised to assess (1) no desire to stop smoking and (2) high motivation to stop smoking. The exposure variable was daily vs. non-daily smoking. Covariates and potential moderators were age, gender, socioeconomic position, presence of children in the household, strength of urges to smoke, vaping status, harm perceptions of e-cigarettes vs. cigarettes and survey year. RESULTS: Non-daily (vs. daily) smoking was associated with greater motivation to stop smoking [adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) = 1.22 (95% confidence interval, CI = 1.13-1.32)]. Non-daily smokers were both less likely than daily smokers to report no desire to stop smoking [40.4% vs. 44.0%; ORadj = 0.85 (95% CI = 0.77-0.95)] and more likely to report high motivation to stop smoking [21.0% vs. 14.8%; ORadj = 1.78 (95% CI = 1.55-2.03)]. These differences in motivation-especially in the odds of reporting no desire to stop smoking-between non-daily and daily smokers were more pronounced among those who were older and less advantaged. Differences were less pronounced among those who reported no urges to smoke, those who vaped and those who perceived e-cigarettes to be less harmful than cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: In England, adults who smoke cigarettes non-daily appear to tend to be more motivated to quit smoking than those who smoke every day, especially among older and less advantaged people.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Cessation fatigue (CF) may be a better predictor than measures such as reported strength of urges to smoke (SUTS) and abstinence self-efficacy (ASE). It may also be affected by quit length and use of other nicotine products. The current study investigated whether post-quitting CF predicts higher relapse risk, its predictive utility relative to ASE and SUTS and whether the CF-relapse prediction was moderated by time since quitting. DESIGN: Data drawn from longitudinal cohort surveys conducted between 2016 and 2022 of the International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey. SETTING: Canada, the United States, England and Australia. PARTICIPANTS: People aged 18 + years who formerly smoked (n = 1914). MEASUREMENTS: Generalised estimating equations logistic regression models were used to test for associations and moderation. FINDINGS: In separate individual analyses, CF, ASE and SUTS were statistically significant independent relapse predictors; however, when analysed together, CF was the only statistically significant relapse predictor [moderate CF: odds ratio (OR) = 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.21-2.23, P = 0.002; high CF: OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.07-3.07, P = 0.027) on top of continuing main effects of vaping and time since quitting, but time since quitting was not a moderator. CONCLUSIONS: Cessation fatigue appears to predict smoking relapse risk better than other measures related to task difficulty and does so independently of vaping and time since quitting, which are both protective.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Rare variants (minor allele frequency <1%) are hypothesized to explain some of this missing heritability. We present two targeted sequencing studies where rare protein-coding variants are functionally characterized in vivo, in silico, and in vitro to examine this hypothesis. In a smoking cessation trial, 1687 individuals were sequenced; characterization measures included the in vivo NMR, in vitro protein expression, and metabolic activity measured from recombinant proteins. In a human liver bank, 312 human liver samples were sequenced; measures included RNA expression, protein expression, and metabolic activity from extracted liver tissue. In total, 38 of 47 rare coding variants identified were novel; characterizations ranged from gain-of-function to loss-of-function. On a population level, the portion of NMR variation explained by the rare coding variants was small (~1%). However, upon incorporation, the accuracy of the wGRS was improved for individuals with rare protein-coding variants (i.e., the residuals were reduced), and approximately one-third of these individuals (12/39) were re-assigned from normal to slow metabolizer status. Rare coding variants can alter an individual's CYP2A6 activity; their integration into wGRSs through precise functional characterization is necessary to accurately assess clinical outcomes and achieve precision medicine for all. Investigation into noncoding variants is warranted to further explain the missing heritability in the NMR.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

METHODS: We assessed expenditures for business-to-business print advertising for ENDS in the United States, by year and by advertiser, from 2015 to 2020; and the content of advertisements placed in 2020. RESULTS: The total number of ENDS brands placing business-to-business advertisements declined from 45 in 2015 to 6 in 2020; spending declined from $2.6 million in 2015 (for 283 occurrences) to $492,789 in 2020 (69 occurrences). Across years, the top-spending advertisers were Logic ($1.9 million), blu ($1.0 million), JUUL ($625,050), NJOY ($373,126) and Vuse ($322,075). Common messages of advertisements placed in 2020 included that products are not intended for minors; brand market share; health warnings; profitability or revenue potential for retailers; and flavours. DISCUSSION: This study suggests that ENDS companies anticipate that ENDS retailers are interested in stocking products that maximise profits, appeal to consumers and comply with regulatory requirements. Declines in the number of advertisers mirror the overall consolidation of the ENDS industry that occurred during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Business-to-business print advertising represents an important channel in which ENDS brands communicate a variety of messages about their products directly to potential retailers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study examines the alcohol content of ARISE and the contribution of ARISE to alcohol industry activities in a key period in the globalisation of the alcohol industry, generating insights into the inter-relationships between the tobacco and alcohol industries in their involvements in policy-oriented science. METHODS: We systematically searched the UCSF Truth Tobacco Documents Library for information about ARISE, alcohol and the alcohol industry. This material was supplemented with an analysis of the contributions by ARISE associates to one volume in the International Center for Alcohol Policies (ICAP) book series on alcohol and pleasure. RESULTS: ARISE placed nicotine alongside caffeine, chocolate and other foods, and alcohol as treats which brought pleasure and other benefits. Alcohol was thus intrinsic to the ARISE project for the tobacco industry. This study shows that at a formative moment in the mid-1990s the major alcohol companies took advantage of the intellectual inheritance and personnel provided by the tobacco industry when establishing ICAP. Key to this was an ICAP conference that resulted in Alcohol and pleasure: A health perspective (1999). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Not only did ARISE use alcohol to play a supporting role in a sophisticated tobacco industry strategy, the alcohol industry engaged with ARISE as part of its own strategy. This shows the importance of careful attention to corporate activities on the fringes of peer-reviewed science.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Nicotine vapes are addictive and many users want to quit. We surveyed current and past users of nicotine vapes to gather insights about their vaping cessation reasons and strategies. METHODS: In December 2022, we undertook a web-based survey in NZ using market research survey panels. Eligible panellists were aged ≥16 years, did not currently smoke and had vaped nicotine. Questions focused on demographics, smoking and vaping status, vaping dependence, strategies used to quit vaping, and triggers for vaping relapse. RESULTS: One thousand one hundred nineteen participants completed the survey: 144 had never smoked; 975 used to smoke, 401 currently vaped nicotine, and 718 used to vape nicotine. Participants were predominantly aged ≥25 years (89%); 63% were female, and 21% were Indigenous Māori and/or Pacific. Predictors of vaping dependence were having smoked or vaped for ≥2 years and vaping >3% nicotine. Reasons for trying to quit vaping included health concerns, disliking feeling dependent, and cost. Quitting strategies included stopping abruptly, nicotine tapering and family/friend support. Triggers for relapse were stress, being around others who vaped and nicotine withdrawal. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In NZ reasons to quit and triggers to return to vaping are similar to quitting smoking. Until more research is available, it seems appropriate to support people who wish to stop vaping with similar strategies used to support people to quit smoking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus has drastically increased as well. We explored the potential association between obesity, diabetes mellitus, and EAC. By means of retrospective interrogation of an administrative database from fiscal year 2005-2009, we identified two cohorts. The cancer cohort was defined as patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus or gastric cardia. The comparison cohort contained patients with gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD; diagnosis coupled with a procedure code for fundoplication). Patient data, including demographic measures, diagnoses of obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, alcohol abuse, and nicotine dependence were examined. A logistic regression model identified risk factors for development of EAC. The sample included 2,836 patients identified as having either EAC (1,704) or fundoplication with GERD (1,132). Although slightly higher percentages of the benign cohort were obese, the cancer cohort had more diabetics (30.8% vs. 14.8%; chi-square = 94.5; P < 0.0001). In a logistic regression analysis adjusting for comorbidity and lifestyle factors, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with esophageal cancer as opposed to GERD without cancer (OR = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-2.8). Nicotine dependence was also identified as a risk factor (OR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.4-2.0). We identified a potential association between diabetes mellitus and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastric cardia. This association appears to be independent of obesity. Additionally, nicotine dependence was identified as a risk factor for EAC.",['Nicotine/NRT'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Identification of gene variants that predict this withdrawal phenotype may lead to tailored pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. Variation on the cannabinoid receptor 1 gene (CNR1) has been related to nicotine dependence, and CNR1 antagonists may increase attention and memory functioning. We targeted CNR1 variants as moderators of a validated neural marker of nicotine withdrawal-related cognitive disruption. CNR1 polymorphisms comprising the 'TAG' haplotype (rs806379, rs1535255 and rs2023239) were tested independently, as no participants in this sample possessed this haplotype. Nicotine withdrawal-related cognitive disruption was indexed as increased resting electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha-1 power density across 17 electrodes. Seventy-three Caucasian Non-Hispanic smokers (≥15 cigarettes per day) visited the laboratory on two occasions following overnight smoking/nicotine deprivation. Either two nicotine or two placebo cigarettes were smoked prior to collecting EEG data at each session. Analyses showed that rs806379 moderated the effects of nicotine deprivation increasing slow wave EEG (P = 0.004). Smokers homozygous for the major allele exhibited greater nicotine withdrawal-related cognitive disruption. The current findings suggest potential efficacy of cannabinoid receptor antagonism as a pharmacotherapy approach for smoking cessation among individuals who exhibit greater nicotine withdrawal-related cognitive disruption.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Given tobacco's physiological and emotional addictiveness and migraine's substantial economic impact, improved functionality can be difficult for those with migraine exposed to tobacco products. Environmental tobacco exposure in indoor spaces and workplaces is associated with exacerbation of headache. Avoidance of headache triggers is included in most comprehensive migraine treatment programs, yet tobacco awareness, avoidance, or coping is rarely emphasized as part of that regimen. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine the various types of tobacco products to which headache sufferers are exposed and the known basic mechanisms by which tobacco (nicotine) exposure promotes headache pain, and to review the extensive literature on tobacco related to headache with a detailed descriptive narrative providing the basis for conclusions regarding association of noncluster headache-related tobacco exposure. Tobacco-related recommendations are offered. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were searched without yearly restriction through the date of submission (May 2015), using the MeSH terms ""tobacco,"" ""tobacco products,"" ""smoking,"" ""tobacco use,"" ""headache,"" and ""headache disorders."" The selection of articles was not limited to English studies or to humans. Articles were excluded when ""headache"" and ""tobacco"" were not both mentioned with data provided. Case series were included. Bibliographies of all articles were screened for additional relevant articles. RESULTS: Although migraineurs worldwide report tobacco smoke among triggers, it is rarely among the highest in frequency, and biases abound with predominantly noncontrolled retrospective data. Prospective population-based diary data are extremely limited, and no controlled trials exist to confirm a cause and effect for headache of any type. Although some studies are nonsupportive and even conflicting, headache, pain, and tobacco exposure currently remain associated. CONCLUSION: Conflicting data support the validity of patient-reported environmental tobacco exposure as a headache trigger. Prospective controlled studies are needed, but unlikely to be performed, to determine the extent that tobacco influences the headache process, in addition to other under-recognized factors. Meanwhile, because of numerous other negative health effects, decreased tobacco exposure should be recommended to headache patients of all ages in hopes of decreasing disability and improving functionality.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Review of internal tobacco industry documents regarding nicotine analogues released as part of the Master Settlement Agreement between the tobacco industry and US state governments in 1998. FINDINGS: The tobacco industry investigated nicotine analogues extensively. Four principal areas of interest are evident. First, research on tobacco products was directed towards greater understanding of nicotine pharmacology, how to screen for potential analogues and how to separate the central and peripheral effects of nicotine. Secondly, interest lay in the potential for analogues to replace nicotine in order to create more 'desirable' products and to circumvent anticipated nicotine regulation. Thirdly, interest lay in potential pharmaceutical applications for analogues such as treatments for neurological disorders. Finally, there was interest in the public relations potential of the therapeutic potential of analogues to reduce the demonization of nicotine, by allowing the industry to point to its beneficial uses. CONCLUSIONS: With tobacco product and nicotine regulation being increasingly advocated in tobacco control it is important to understand the industry's interests in the potential role of nicotine analogues. Initial interest included using analogues as a means to circumvent regulation, but evidence suggests these plans were discarded due to fear that this may have instigated regulation of tobacco products. Nicotine analogue research has led to potential therapeutic uses for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and alarmingly for the industry, to a potential vaccine to prevent nicotine addiction. RECOMMENDATIONS: Tobacco manufacturers should be obliged to declare all additives being used in tobacco products. Regulatory bodies should be aware that that there is a distinct possibility that the industry has discovered ways to circumvent future regulation of nicotine through the utilization of nicotine analogues. Any regulatory drafting should broaden the definition of nicotine in order to incorporate analogues into the scope of pharmacologically active substances being regulated.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DESIGN: Archival records of television advertising exposures from Nielsen Media Research for the largest 75 media markets in the United States from 1999 to 2003. MEASUREMENTS: Mean monthly advertising exposures for households with televisions and adolescents aged 12-17 years for: state tobacco control programs; the national American Legacy Foundation (Legacy) program; tobacco company advertising for youth smoking prevention, parent advertising and corporate image; pharmaceutical company advertising for nicotine replacement therapy and Zyban; and other miscellaneous tobacco-related advertising. FINDINGS: Combined tobacco company youth/parent advertising exposures matched those for combined State/Legacy campaigns (4.56 advertisements/month versus 4.97 advertisements/month among households; 3.05 advertisements/month versus 3.38 advertisements/month among adolescents). Tobacco company corporate image advertising averaged 3.25 advertisements/month among households and 0.73 advertisements/month among adolescents. Tobacco company advertising exceeded public health-sponsored advertising by a factor of 1.57-1, and among youth by 1.11-1. Pharmaceutical companies were the largest sponsor of tobacco-related advertising for households (10.37 advertisements/month) and provided significant exposure among adolescents (2.61 advertisements/month). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate systematically that public health-sponsored antitobacco campaigns in the United States are matched or exceeded by tobacco company advertising, as well as pharmaceutical cessation product advertising. Research is needed to determine whether such advertising may dilute or undermine the established benefits of tobacco control-sponsored campaigns.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

INTERVENTION: The interviewer described a novel cigarette that claimed to significantly reduce exposure to smoke toxins. MEASUREMENTS: Respondents' interest in purchasing the PREP-C, beliefs about its safety and risk reduction and smokers' quit interest, as measured by stage of change, before and after exposure to PREP-C information. FINDINGS: Among smokers, 76.5% were interested in purchasing PREP-C; interest did not vary by stage of change. Almost all smokers (90.6%) thought PREP-C was safer than regular cigarettes, with 5.4% indicating that the health risks were equivalent to not smoking at all. Exposure to PREP-C description did not change quit interest. Among ex-smokers, 5.6% believed PREP-C carried no health risk and 7.1% expressed purchase interest. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers and ex-smokers interpreted claims of reduced toxin exposure as reduced health risk and responded positively towards PREP-Cs.

The objective of this study is to examine tobacco industry involvement in the development of scientific books. DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of previously secret internal tobacco industry documents retrieved from the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library (http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu). Information from the documents was supplemented with material from Internet searches, the National Center for Biotechnology Information Pubmed database and interviews with individuals involved in book publication. FINDINGS: Between 1997 and 1999 the tobacco industry sponsored a monograph, entitled 'Analytical Determination of Nicotine and Related Compounds and their Metabolites', that examined the measurement and metabolism of nicotine. The tobacco industry recruited Elsevier Science to publish the monograph. Tobacco industry executives, lawyers and scientists reviewed the chapters. One use of the monograph was to stimulate collaborative efforts between academic and tobacco industry scientists. Another was to provide the book to a government regulatory agency reviewing the teratogenic effects of nicotine. CONCLUSION: Our findings show the breadth of tobacco industry engagement in scientific knowledge production and dissemination, and its motives for sponsoring scientific literature. The industry's effort to gain credibility through collaboration with academic scientists raises questions regarding the ethics of accepting tobacco industry funding for publication. Scientists who collaborate on publications sponsored by the tobacco industry must consider the full implications of these joint efforts.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The data come from the first seven waves (2002-09) of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation (ITC) Four-Country Survey, an annual cohort telephone survey of adult smokers in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia (21 613 individual cases). 'Light' and 'mild' descriptors were removed in 2003 in the United Kingdom, in 2006 in Australia and in 2007 in Canada. We compare beliefs about 'light' cigarettes both before and after the bans, with those of smokers in the United States serving as the control condition. MEASURES: Smokers' beliefs about 'light' cigarettes were assessed using a set of statements rated on a five-point 'agree'-'disagree' scale. FINDINGS: The proportions of respondents reporting misperceptions about light cigarettes declined between 2002 and 2009 in all four countries. There were marked temporary reductions in reported misperceptions in the United Kingdom and Australia, but not in Canada, following the removal of 'light/mild' descriptors. CONCLUSIONS: Removal of 'light/mild' descriptors and tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yield information from cigarette packs is insufficient to effectively eliminate false beliefs. The combination of alternative descriptors and design features that produce differences in taste strength and harshness, independent of actual intakes, are sufficient to produce or sustain the same misbeliefs.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

DESIGN: Multiple time series analysis using structural vector autoregression, January 2002-May 2010. SETTING: England and Wales. DATA SOURCES: Tobacco control campaign data from the Central Office of Information; commercial NRT campaign data; data on calls to the National Health Service (NHS) stop smoking helpline from the Department of Health; point-of-sale data on over-the-counter (OTC) sales of NRT; and prescribing data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a database of UK primary care records. MEASUREMENTS: Monthly calls to the NHS stop smoking helpline and monthly rates of OTC sales and prescribing of NRT. FINDINGS: A 1% increase in tobacco control television ratings (TVRs), a standard measure of advertising exposure, was associated with a statistically significant 0.085% increase in calls in the same month (P = 0.007), and no statistically significant effect in subsequent months. Tobacco control TVRs were not associated with OTC NRT sales or prescribed NRT. NRT advertising TVRs had a significant effect on NRT sales which became non-significant in the seasonally adjusted model, and no significant effect on prescribing or calls. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco control campaigns appear to be more effective at triggering quitting behaviour than pharmaceutical company NRT campaigns. Any effect of such campaigns on quitting behaviour seems to be restricted to the month of the campaign, suggesting that such campaigns need to be sustained over time.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Primary analyses utilized the subset of respondents who participated in 2006 or later (n = 2550). MEASUREMENTS: Continuous abstinence from smoking for 1 month/6 months. FINDINGS: Among participants who recalled making a quit attempt within 1 month of interview, those who reported using varenicline, bupropion or nicotine patch were more likely to maintain 6-month continuous abstinence from smoking compared to those who attempted to quit without medication [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 5.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) (2.12-16.12), 3.94 (0.87-17.80), 4.09 (1.72-9.74), respectively]; there were no clear effects for oral NRT use. Those who did not use any medication when attempting to quit tended to be younger, to be racial/ethnic minorities, to have lower incomes and to believe that medications do not make quitting easier.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 204 healthy black (n = 69) and white (n = 135) smokers were enrolled into two clinical studies. MEASUREMENT: Nicotine equivalents (nicotine and its metabolites), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3)pyridyl-1-butanol (NNAL) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites were measured in urine. The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and time to first cigarette (TFC) measured tobacco dependence. FINDINGS: Average TFC and FTND for blacks and whites were not significantly different. Urine NNAL and nicotine equivalents increased with increasing FTND in whites but did not increase in blacks (race × FTND interaction, both P < 0.031). The interaction term was not significant for PAHs. An inverse relationship was seen between FTND and nicotine equivalents, NNAL and PAH metabolites per cigarette in blacks but remained flat in whites (race × FTND interaction, all P ≤ 0.039). Regardless of dependence (low dependence, TFC >15 minutes; high dependence, TFC ≤15 minutes), FTND and TFC were not correlated significantly with urine nicotine equivalents and carcinogen exposure in blacks. We found moderate correlations between FTND and TFC and nicotine equivalents and carcinogen exposure among whites of low dependence and non-significant correlations among whites of high dependence.

Most toxicity due to cigarette smoking is related to the burning process. APPROACH: Models of harm reduction applied to tobacco suggest that use of non-combustible, less toxic, nicotine-containing products as a substitute for cigarette smoking would reduce the death toll arising from tobacco use. Available options include medicinal nicotine and smokeless tobacco products. KEY FINDINGS: The potential role of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products in a harm reduction strategy is currently severely restricted by strict regulations on dose, safety and potential addictiveness. As a result, NRT products are designed to provide much less nicotine, and deliver it to the brain more slowly, than cigarettes, which are widely accessible and poorly regulated. Smokeless tobacco (snus) has proved to be an acceptable reduced hazard alternative to smoking in Sweden, but supply of snus is illegal elsewhere in the European Union. IMPLICATIONS: To increase accessibility and reach more smokers, barriers to the use of NRT use need to be removed and more effective NRTs need urgently to be developed. Smokeless tobacco could also play an important role in harm reduction, but current European Union regulations and concerns over exploitation by tobacco companies currently preclude wider use. CONCLUSION: To improve public health there is an urgent need for an appropriate regulatory framework and regulatory authority at the European level, controlling both tobacco and nicotine products to ensure that the least harmful products are the most accessible.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The company asserted that its goal was to deliver the messages of the public health community about tobacco. However, internal tobacco company documents reveal that the site was a public relations effort intended to help the company avoid punishment and regulation. Examination of the language on the Web site reveals many contradictions and omissions that may undermine public health messages. Among these are vague and confusing information about addiction, tar, and nicotine, a lack of motivators to quit smoking, and silence about tobacco-related mortality. By appearing to join with public health organizations in disseminating ""responsible"" messages about tobacco, PM may improve its image, thus facilitating its ability to continue to sell its lethal products. Public health nurses should be prepared to examine health information on the Internet for subtle biases, to counter PM's specific language about smoking to patients, and to challenge PM's larger corporate goals.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Though social influences on substance use and abuse (e.g., peer and family influence, socioeconomic status) are well documented, biomedical intervention is becoming increasingly technoscientific in nature. We wish to elucidate how emphasizing biological influences on substance use may lead to a vision of addiction as a phenomenon isolated within our bodies and neurochemistry, not lived daily within a complex social web of relationships and a particular political economy, including the tobacco industry, which aggressively markets products known to cause harm. METHODS: We explore the emerging view of addiction as a ""disease of the brain"" in open-ended interviews with 86 stakeholders from the fields of nicotine research and tobacco control. Interview data were analyzed using standard qualitative techniques. RESULTS: Most stakeholders hold a medicalized view of addiction. Though environmental variables are understood to be a primary cause of smoking initiation, the speed and strength with which addiction occurs is understood to be a largely biological process. Though stakeholders believe that an increased focus on addiction as a disease of the brain is not likely to lead to widespread unrealistic expectations for cessation therapies, they remain concerned that it may reinforce teenagers' expectations that quitting is not difficult. Finally, stakeholder responses indicate that genetic and neuroscientific research is unlikely to increase or decrease stigmatization, but will be used by interest groups to buttress their existing views of the stigma associated with smoking. CONCLUSION: We argue that the main potential harms of focusing on biological etiology stem from a concept of addiction that is disassociated from social context. Focusing on genetic testing and brain scans may lead one to overemphasize pharmaceutical ""magic bullet cures"" and underemphasize, and underfund, more traditional therapies and public health prevention strategies that have proven to be effective. Genetic research on addiction may fundamentally change our conception of deviance and our identities, and may thus transform our susceptibility to substance use into something isolated in our biology, not embedded in a biosocial context.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The literature on the cardiovascular side effects of ST is scant, and there are many controversies associated with its use, for various reasons. Study findings show that ST may modestly increase cardiovascular mortality and produces transient changes in heart rate and blood pressure; however, it does not increase the risk of atherosclerosis or myocardial infarction. The association between ST and diabetes, lipoproteins, and stroke is less clear. Quitting ST causes weight gain, but less so than smoking. Although ST appears to be associated with less cardiovascular risk than smoking, nicotine replacement therapy is a safer and more controlled substitute for smoking than ST; however, ST can be considered in high-risk smokers in whom medicinal nicotine replacement therapy has failed.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Advertising implies that smokeless tobacco habits are innocuous and safe, but existing scientific evidence indicates that dipping and chewing are potentially harmful to one's health. Health professionals are urged to advise patients and students concerning the potential hazards of using smokeless tobacco. Further, health professionals should take a strong public stance in opposition to the current dipping and chewing advertising campaigns aimed at youth. These advertisements totally ignore the possible health hazards of smokeless tobacco. If the tobacco companies are allowed to continue to advertise smokeless tobacco in the same manner that they use to promote cigarette smoking, then some effort should be directed to require health warnings in these advertisements. In fact, some serious consideration should most likely be given to banning this new wave of tobacco marketing in the interest of public health, just as was the case with cigarette advertisements, especially in light of the fact that these ads are primarily targeted to young boys and men.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The optimum pH range for formation of NNA, NNN, and NNK was 2.4 to 3.1. Thiocyanate (100 mM) slightly increased the rate of formation of NNN and NNK but tripled the rate of formation of NNA at pH 3.5 at 37 degrees C. We have also studied the nitrosation of pseudooxynicotine, a bacterial and fungal metabolite of nicotine. This secondary amine nitrosated rapidly to produce NNK. Our proposed mechanism for the conversion of nicotine to NNK includes nine kinetically distinct steps and is in agreement with our experimental results. The rate limiting step involves the formation of nicotine-1',2'-iminium ion. This ion hydrolyzes to form pseudooxynicotine which undergoes rapid, irreversible nitrosation to NNK. Given the very slow rate of nicotine nitrosation, it is unlikely that nicotine itself contributes to exposure to nitroso compounds due to chemically mediated intragastric nitrosation.",['Nicotine/NRT'],Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: We used data from waves 1, 2, and 3 (2013-2016) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study, a nationally representative study of 13,650 US youth ages 12 to 17 and their parents. We conducted weighted multivariate analyses comparing parent unawareness of youth-reported ever use and associations between parents' unawareness of youth use and covariates. RESULTS: Youth ever tobacco use ranged from 21.8% in 2013-2014, to 24.1% in 2014-2015, to 23.4% in 2015-2016.

Four MYC2 genes were found in the tobacco genome, NtMYC2a/2b and 1a/1b. In this study, we tested whether one of them, NtMYC2a, acts as a 'master switch' in the regulation of nicotine biosynthesis and transport in tobacco. We generated NtMYC2a knockout tobacco plants using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique and analysed the effect of NtMYC2a knockout on expression of the nicotine biosynthesis genes (NtAO, NtQS, NtPMT1a, NtQPT2, NtODC2, NtMPO1, NtA622 and NtBBLa) and transport genes (NtMATE2 and NtJAT1), as well as leaf accumulation of nicotine in the NtMYC2a knockout plants. We found that all the nicotine biosynthesis and transport genes tested in this study were significantly downregulated (>50% reduction compared with wild-type control) in the NtMYC2a knockout plants. Moreover, the leaf nicotine content in knockout plants was dramatically reduced by ca 80% compared with the wild-type control. These results clearly show that NtMYC2a acts as a 'master switch' to coordinate JA-induced nicotine accumulation in tobacco and suggests that NtMYC2a might play an important role in tobacco nicotine-mediated defence against herbivory.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Other countries' experiences and perspectives, and how they could inform tobacco control in Japan].","""Tobacco harm reduction"" is defined as a method to minimize harm and risk of death and disease without eliminating tobacco and nicotine use. In Japan, where heated tobacco products (HTPs) are prevalent, the tobacco industry is progressively endorsing the concept of ""tobacco harm reduction."" Therefore, stakeholders in tobacco control must urgently share perspectives and experiences surrounding this issue. This discussion paper aimed to propose four requirements for effectively implementing ""tobacco harm reduction"" as a public health measure: (1) disease risk reduction, (2) cigarette smoking cessation, (3) no additional public health concerns, and (4) regulatory authorities held by health agencies, and compile information on them regarding nicotine-containing electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and HTPs. Another aim was to summarize policies related to ""tobacco harm reduction"" adopted by an international organization (World Health Organization (WHO) and health authorities in foreign countries (the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, Italy, and the Republic of Korea) to explore the implications of these requirements on Japan's approach. Regarding the first three requirements, scientific evidence indicated that e-cigarettes offers some level of risk reduction and can assist with cigarette smoking cessation. The potential uptake of e-cigarettes among youth and their possibility to serve as a gateway to combusted cigarette use is a concern, though a definitive causal link is yet to be established between the uptake of e-cigarette in youth and the subsequent use of different tobacco products. There is insufficient scientific evidence for any of the three requirements for HTPs. Regarding the official policies, WHO took the position that the same regulations should be applied to all tobacco products. Only the UK and USA officially established a health system based on the concept of ""tobacco harm reduction""; even in Italy and the Republic of Korea, where HTPs are relatively widespread, health authorities denied any risk reduction by introducing HTPs. The UK officially adopted a smoking cessation policy with e-cigarettes. The USA established a modified risk tobacco product system under federal legislation enacted in 2009, whereas of June 2023, no HTP or e-cigarettes were recognized as explicitly reducing health risk. Regarding the fourth requirement, the UK and USA institutionalized ""tobacco harm reduction"" under health authorities' regulation independent of the tobacco industry. The introduction of a tobacco harm reduction policy in Japan should be considered only in line with health authorities' regulation and implementation of comprehensive tobacco control measures independent of the tobacco industry.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The results showed that core bacterial communities in the fermentation process were Cyanobacteria, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus, and Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Inocybe were the most metabolically active fungi. Pseudomonas fulva, Staphylococcus nepalensis, Bacillus subtilis, Stenotrophomonas rhizophila, Alternaria alternata, and Aspergillus cristatus could degrade carbon and nitrogen compounds, such as protein, starch, lignin, and nicotine. There were 12 common non-volatile metabolites and three common volatile metabolites in DH, LC, PE, and YX before and after fermentation, of which menatetrenone, solanidine, γ-glutamylphenylalanine, carotol, and phenol, 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) were significantly different before and after fermentation. The synthesis and degradation metabolism of various amino acids, alkaloids, and flavonoids are the key metabolic pathways of characteristic flavor development during CTL fermentation. Co-occurrence and interaction patterns showed that seven bacteria and 12 fungi were strictly linearly positively or negatively correlated with 72 and 55 volatile compounds, respectively. In conclusion, this study preliminarily confirmed that CTL fermentation is a microbially mediated carbon-nitrogen coupling metabolism. The carbohydrates in tobacco leaves were largely decomposed and consumed, providing energy sources for microorganisms and the carbon skeleton required for cell construction. The nitrogen-containing macromolecular compounds were degraded to form volatile compounds or flavor precursors with typical flavor. IMPORTANCE: The development of the metabolic state and characteristic flavor of cigar tobacco during fermentation is the key to process control. Innovative discoveries in the development of the metabolic state and characteristic flavor of cigar tobacco during fermentation are the key to process control. Innovative discoveries of core functional microorganisms and key metabolites were made during fermentation, suggesting potential pathways for carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. We demonstrate for the first time that cigar tobacco leaf fermentation is a microbially mediated carbon-nitrogen coupling metabolism. Many carbohydrates in tobacco leaves are decomposed and consumed to provide energy source and carbon skeleton for the construction of microbial cells, and nitrogen-containing macromolecular compounds are degraded to form volatile compounds or flavor precursors with typical flavors.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Absolute increases in long term vaping were larger among people with a history of regular smoking (current smokers: 4.8% (4.0% to 5.8%) to 23.1% (20.4% to 25.9%); recent former smokers: 5.7% (3.4% to 9.2%) to 36.1% (27.6% to 45.4%); long term former smokers: 1.4% (1.0% to 1.9%) to 16.2% (14.2% to 18.4%)), but an increase also occurred among people who had never regularly smoked (0.1% (0.0% to 0.2%) to 3.0% (2.3% to 3.8%)). Growth was also more pronounced in young adults (eg, reaching 22.7% (19.2% to 26.5%) of 18 year olds v 4.3% (3.6% to 5.2%) of 65 year olds), including among those who had never regularly smoked (reaching 16.1% (11.1% to 22.7%) of 18 year olds v 0.3% (0.1% to 0.6%) of 65 year olds). Between October 2013 and March 2021, most long term vapers mainly or exclusively used refillable electronic cigarettes (2.5% to 3.3% of adults) and few (0.1% of adults) used disposable devices. However, prevalence of long term vaping using disposable devices subsequently rose rapidly, and by October 2023 similar proportions of adults mainly or exclusively used disposable and refillable devices (4.9% (4.2% to 5.7%) and 4.6% (4.0% to 5.3%), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of long term vaping increased substantially among adults in England during 2013-23. Much of this increase occurred from 2021, coinciding with the rise in popularity of disposable e-cigarettes. Half of long term vapers now mainly or exclusively use disposable devices. The growth was concentrated among people with a history of regular smoking, but an increase also occurred among people who never regularly smoked, especially young adults.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

DESIGN: Cross sectional study with qualitative semistructured interviews, augmented by smokers' day grid. SETTING: Two areas of socioeconomic deprivation in Edinburgh. PARTICIPANTS: 50 male and 50 female smokers aged 25-40 years randomly selected from general practitioners' lists from two health centres, each located in an area of deprivation. RESULTS: Most smokers wanted to quit but felt unable to because of the importance of smoking in their daily routine and their addiction to nicotine. Strategies for maintaining consumption levels in the face of increasing cigarette prices and low income included purchasing contraband cigarettes and tobacco. Vendors were contacted through social networks, family, and friends as well as common knowledge of people and places, particularly pubs where contraband was available. Most users of contraband considered that smugglers were providing a valuable service. Purchasing contraband tobacco was viewed as rational in the face of material hardship. Many smokers criticised the government for its high tobacco taxation and the lack of local services to help them to stop smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers in deprived areas perceive a lack of support to help them to stop smoking. Cigarette and tobacco smuggling is therefore viewed positively by low income smokers as a way of dealing with the increasing cost of cigarettes. Smokers in areas of deprivation may thus show little support for tackling smuggling until more action is taken to deal with the material and personal factors that make it difficult for them to quit.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Science Citation Index, registries of ongoing trials, reference lists, the drug company that sponsored most of the trials, and clinical experts. Review methods Eligible studies were published or unpublished randomised controlled trials that enrolled smokers who declared no intention to quit smoking in the short term, and compared nicotine replacement therapy (with or without motivational support) with placebo, no treatment, other pharmacological therapy, or motivational support, and reported quit rates. Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria. One reviewer assessed study quality and extracted data and these processes were checked by a second reviewer. The primary outcome, six months sustained abstinence from smoking beginning during treatment, was assessed by individual patient data analysis. Other outcomes were cessation and reduction at end of follow-up, and adverse events. DATA SYNTHESIS: Seven placebo controlled randomised controlled trials were included (four used nicotine replacement therapy gum, two nicotine replacement therapy inhaler, and one free choice of therapy). They were reduction studies that reported smoking cessation as a secondary outcome. The trials enrolled a total of 2767 smokers, gave nicotine replacement therapy for 6-18 months, and lasted 12-26 months. 6.75% of smokers receiving nicotine replacement therapy attained sustained abstinence for six months, twice the rate of those receiving placebo (relative risk (fixed effects) 2.06, 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 3.15; (random effects) 1.99, 1.01 to 3.91; five trials). The number needed to treat was 29. All other cessation and reduction outcomes were significantly more likely in smokers given nicotine replacement therapy than those given placebo. There were no statistically significant differences in adverse events (death, odds ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 4.02; serious adverse events, 1.16, 0.79 to 1.50; and discontinuation because of adverse events, 1.25, 0.64 to 2.51) except nausea, which was more common with nicotine replacement therapy (8.7% v 5.3%; odds ratio 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 2.36). CONCLUSIONS: Available trials indicate that nicotine replacement therapy is an effective intervention in achieving sustained smoking abstinence for smokers who have no intention or are unable to attempt an abrupt quit. Most of the evidence, however, comes from trials with regular behavioural support and monitoring and it is unclear whether using nicotine replacement therapy without regular contact would be as effective.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

DESIGN: Meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and trials listed in Cochrane reviews of smoking cessation interventions (nicotine replacement therapy, nicotinic partial agonists, antidepressants, and exercise) for randomised trials of first line treatments (nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline) and exercise that reported weight change. We also searched CENTRAL for trials of interventions for weight gain after cessation. REVIEW METHODS: Trials were included if they recorded weight change from baseline to follow-up in abstinent smokers. We used a random effects inverse variance model to calculate the mean and 95% confidence intervals and the mean of the standard deviation for weight change from baseline to one, two, three, six, and 12 months after quitting. We explored subgroup differences using random effects meta-regression. RESULTS: 62 studies were included. In untreated quitters, mean weight gain was 1.12 kg (95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.47), 2.26 kg (1.98 to 2.54), 2.85 kg (2.42 to 3.28), 4.23 kg (3.69 to 4.77), and 4.67 kg (3.96 to 5.38) at one, two, three, six, and 12 months after quitting, respectively. Using the means and weighted standard deviations, we calculated that at 12 months after cessation, 16%, 37%, 34%, and 13% of untreated quitters lost weight, and gained less than 5 kg, gained 5-10 kg, and gained more than 10 kg, respectively. Estimates of weight gain were similar for people using different pharmacotherapies to support cessation. Estimates were also similar between people especially concerned about weight gain and those not concerned. CONCLUSION: Smoking cessation is associated with a mean increase of 4-5 kg in body weight after 12 months of abstinence, and most weight gain occurs within three months of quitting. Variation in weight change is large, with about 16% of quitters losing weight and 13% gaining more than 10 kg.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

DESIGN: Repeat cross sectional surveys. SETTING: Online surveys in Canada, England, and the US. PARTICIPANTS: National samples of 16 to 19 year olds in 2017 and 2018, recruited from commercial panels in Canada (n=7891), England (n=7897), and the US (n=8140). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of vaping and smoking was assessed for use ever, in the past 30 days, in the past week, and on 15 days or more in the past month. Use of JUUL (a nicotine salt based electronic cigarette with high nicotine concentration) and usual vaping brands were also assessed. Logistic regression models examined differences in vaping and smoking between countries and over time. RESULTS: The prevalence of vaping in the past 30 days, in the past week, and on 15 days or more in the past month increased in Canada and the US between 2017 and 2018 (P<0.001 for all), including among non-smokers and experimental smokers, with no changes in England. Smoking prevalence increased in Canada (P<0.001 for all measures), with modest increases in England, and no changes in the US. The percentage of ever vapers who reported more frequent vaping increased in Canada and the US (P<0.01 for all), but not in England. The use of JUUL increased in all countries, particularly the US and Canada-for example, the proportion of current vapers in the US citing JUUL as their usual brand increased threefold between 2017 and 2018. CONCLUSIONS: Between 2017 and 2018, among 16 to 19 year olds the prevalence of vaping increased in Canada and the US, as did smoking in Canada, with little change in England. The rapidly evolving vaping market and emergence of nicotine salt based products warrant close monitoring.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We reviewed and analysed internal tobacco industry documents relevant to the Thai market during the 1980s. TTCs' attempts to access the Thai cigarette market during the 1980s concentrated on political lobbying, advertising and promotion of the foreign brands that were illegal to sell in Thailand at the time. They sought to take advantage of the Thai Tobacco Monopoly's (TTM) inefficiency to propose licencing agreements and joint ventures with TTM and took advantages of unclear regulations about cigarette marketing to promote their products through advertising and sponsorship activities. After their initial efforts failed, they successfully lobbied the US to impose trade sanctions to liberalise Thailand's market. Similar to the situation for cigarettes in the 1980s, since 2017, Philip Morris International has worked in parallel with a pro-e-cigarette group to pressure Thailand's government to allow sales of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS; including e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products), knowing the products were illegal under Thai law. Health advocates and government authorities should be aware of past TTCs' tactics for cigarettes and anticipate that TTCs will attempt to use international trade law to force markets open for ENDS if their domestic efforts fail.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Exposure to tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (TAPS) is a risk factor for smoking initiation, and therefore the Article 13 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) requires comprehensive TAPS bans. We examined the associations between changes in youth cigarette smoking and implementation of Article 13. METHODS: We used two rounds of cross-sectional data from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) for 42 countries: first between 2006 and 2015, and second between 2017 and 2020. The GYTS data were linked with the WHO FCTC implementation reports from 2016 and 2018. The outcome was current smoking. Multilevel binary logistic regression models, stratified by country income level, were used to test the prevalence differences between the latest and previous GYTS rounds and their associations with TAPS bans with postestimations using marginal analyses. RESULTS: The percentage of students currently smoking decreased from 10.0% (95% CI 8.0 to 12.1) to 7.7% (95% CI 6.1 to 9.3) from first to second GYTS rounds (p<0.001), adjusting for country clustering. In low-income and lower-middle-income countries, the degree of decrease significantly differed between countries with versus without bans on display, partial internet TAPS ban, ban on depiction of tobacco products and by number of TAPS measures, adjusting for age and sex of the respondents. In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, the degree of decrease significantly differed by presence (or absence) of partial or full internet TAPS ban, ban on product placement and by number of TAPS measures. CONCLUSION: Implementation of TAPS bans is associated with decreased smoking among adolescents both in high-income and low-income countries. Enhanced and continuous efforts are necessary to protect youth from the promotion of tobacco and nicotine products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

As these companies faced increasingly restrictive policies and lawsuits, they planned to shift their business to socially acceptable reduced-harm products. We describe the internal motivations and strategies to achieve this goal. METHODS: We analysed previously secret tobacco industry documents available through the Truth Tobacco Documents Library. These documents were triangulated with TTCs' investor and other professional reports, websites and public statements. FINDINGS: Mimicking pharmaceutical business models, tobacco companies sought to refurbish their image and ensure long-term profitability by creating and selling pharmaceutical-like products as smoking declined. These products included snus, heated tobacco products, e-cigarettes, nicotine gums and inhalers. Tobacco companies created separate divisions to develop and roll out these products, and the majority developed medical research programmes to steer these products through regulatory agencies, seeking certification as reduced-harm or pharmaceutical products. These products were regarded as key to the survival of the tobacco industry in an unfriendly political and social climate. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmaceuticalisation was pursued to perpetuate the profitability of tobacco and nicotine for tobacco companies, not as a sincere search to mitigate the harms of smoking in society. Promotion of new pharmaceuticalised products has split the tobacco control community, with some public health professionals and institutions advocating for the use of 'clean' reduced-harm nicotine and tobacco products, essentially carrying out tobacco industry objectives.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

SETTING: Fixed retail outlets subject to a ban on the display of tobacco products. PARTICIPANTS: Observational audit of all stores selling tobacco products (n=96) in 4 Scottish communities, conducted over 2 waves 12 months apart (2013-2014), and qualitative interviews with small retailers (n=25) in 4 matched communities. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The audit measured e-cigarette display characteristics, advertising materials and proximity to other products, and differences by area-level disadvantage. Interviews explored retailers' perceptions of e-cigarette market opportunities and risks, and customer responses. RESULTS: The number of e-cigarette point-of-sale display units and number of brands displayed increased between waves. E-cigarettes were displayed close to products of interest to children in 36% of stores. Stores in more affluent areas were less likely to have external e-cigarette advertising than those in deprived areas. Although e-cigarettes delivered high profit margins, retailers were confused by the diversity of brands and products, and uncertain of the sector's viability. Some customers were perceived to purchase e-cigarettes as cessation aids, and others, particularly low-income smokers, as a cheaper adjunct to conventional tobacco. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette point-of-sale displays and number of brands displayed increased over 12 months, a potential cause for concern given their lack of regulation. Further scrutiny is needed of the content and effects of such advertising, and the potentially normalising effects of placing e-cigarettes next to products of interest to children.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We estimated how far changes in prevalence of e-cigarette and NRT use while smoking were accompanied by changes in cigarette consumption at the population level. DESIGN: Repeated representative cross-sectional population surveys of adults aged 16+ years in England. METHODS: We used Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogeneous Input (ARIMAX) modelling of monthly data between 2006 and 2016 from the Smoking Toolkit Study. Prevalence of e-cigarette use and NRT use in current smokers, and specifically for smoking reduction and temporary abstinence, were input variables. Mean daily cigarette consumption was the dependent variable. Analyses involved adjustment for mass media expenditure and tobacco-control policies. RESULTS: No statistically significant associations were found between changes in use of e-cigarettes (β -0.012, 95% CI -0.026 to 0.002) or NRT (β 0.015, 95% CI -0.026 to 0.055) while smoking and daily cigarette consumption. Neither did we find clear evidence for an association between e-cigarette use (β -0.010, 95% CI -0.025 to 0.005 and β 0.011, 95%-0.027 to 0.004) or NRT use (β 0.006, 95%-0.030 to 0.043 and β 0.022, 95%-0.020 to 0.063) specifically for smoking reduction and temporary abstinence, respectively, and changes in daily cigarette consumption. CONCLUSION: If use of e-cigarettes and licensed NRT while smoking acted to reduce cigarette consumption in England between 2006 and 2016, the effect was likely very small at a population level.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, the manufacture, advertisement and sale of flavoured cigar products are permitted. Such flavourings influence positive perceptions of tobacco products and are linked to increased use. Flavourings may mask the taste of tobacco and enhance smoke inhalation, influencing toxicant exposure and abuse liability among novice tobacco users. Using clinical laboratory methods, this study investigates how flavour availability affects measures of abuse liability in young adult cigarette smokers. The specific aims are to evaluate the effect of cigar flavours on nicotine exposure, and behavioural and subjective measures of abuse liability. METHODS AND ANALYSES: Participants (projected n=25) are healthy smokers of five or more cigarettes per day over the past 3 months, 18-25 years old, naive to cigar use (lifetime use of 50 or fewer cigar products and no more than 10 cigars smoked in the past 30 days) and without a desire to quit cigarette smoking in the next 30 days. Participants complete five laboratory sessions in a Latin square design with either their own brand cigarette or a session-specific Black & Mild cigar differing in flavour (apple, cream, original and wine). Participants are single-blinded to cigar flavours. Each session consists of two 10-puff smoking bouts (30 s interpuff interval) separated by 1 hour. Primary outcomes include saliva nicotine concentration, behavioural economic task performance and response to various questionnaire items assessing subjective effects predictive of abuse liability. Differences in outcomes across own brand cigarette and flavoured cigar conditions will be tested using linear mixed models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Virginia Commonwealth University Institutional Review Board approved the study (VCU IRB: HM20007848). Dissemination channels for study findings include scientific journals, scientific meetings, and policy briefs.

Patterns of co-use of tobacco and cannabis may change as more jurisdictions legalise medicinal and/or recreational cannabis sales. This analysis examined predictors of current cannabis use and characterised methods of consumption among smokers and non-smokers in a context where cannabis use is legal. SETTING: The 2015 International Tobacco Control Netherlands-Gold Magic Survey conducted between July and August 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n=1599; 1003 current smokers, 283 former smokers and 390 non-smokers) were asked to report their current (past 30-day) use of cigarettes and cannabis. Cigarette smokers reported whether they primarily used factory made of roll-your-own cigarettes. Those who reported any cannabis use in the last 30 days were asked about forms of cannabis used. X2and logistic regression analyses were used to assess relationships among combustible tobacco and cannabis use. RESULTS: Past 30-day cannabis use was somewhat higher among current tobacco (or cigarette) smokers (n=57/987=5.8%) than among former or never smokers (n=10/288=3.5% and n=6/316=1.9%, respectively). Joints were the most commonly used form of cannabis use for both current cigarette smokers (96.9%) and non-smokers (76.5%). Among those who smoked cannabis joints, 95% current smokers and 67% of non-smokers reported that they 'always' roll cannabis with tobacco. CONCLUSIONS: In this Netherlands-based sample, most cannabis was reported to be consumed via smoking joints, most often mixed with tobacco. This behaviour may present unique health concerns for non-cigarette smoking cannabis users, since tobacco use could lead to nicotine dependence. Moreover, many non-cigarette smoking cannabis users appear to be misclassified as to their actual tobacco/nicotine exposure.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,Yes,

DESIGN: Cross-sectional and prospective survey, the Smoking Toolkit Study, with baseline data collected between September 2014 and September 2016 and follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. SETTING: England. PARTICIPANTS: Population representative sample of 40 933 adults aged 16+ years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of long-term (≥12 months) use of e-cigarettes and NRT by retrospective self-report among baseline respondents (all adults, n=40 933; smokers, n=8406) and current use at baseline, 6 months and 12 months in a subsample of smokers who responded to follow-up (n=733). RESULTS: Of baseline respondents, 1.5% (95% CI 1.4% to 1.6%, n=604) of adults and 3.9% (95% CI 3.5% to 4.3%, n=327) of smokers were long-term e-cigarette users and 0.5% (95% CI 0.4% to 0.6%, n=205) of adults and 1.3% (95% CI 1.1% to 1.5%, n=112) of smokers were long-term NRT users. Assessed prospectively, 13.4% (95% CI 10.9% to 15.9%, n=100) of smokers were long-term e-cigarette users and 1.9% (95% CI 0.9% to 2.9%, n=14) were long-term NRT users. Among all adults, long-term use by never smokers of either e-cigarettes (0.1%, n=27) or NRT (0.0%, n=7) was rare. Among past-year smokers, long-term e-cigarette and NRT use was higher among older smokers compared with those who were 16-34 years old (OR range=1.55-5.21). Long-term e-cigarette use only was lower in smokers who were less educated (OR=0.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.81), from social grades C2DE (OR=0.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.84) and with children in the household (OR=0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.85). Long-term e-cigarette use and long-term NRT use were higher among smokers more motivated to quit (OR=2.05, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.60 and OR=2.33, 95% CI 1.57 to 3.46). CONCLUSIONS: In the adult population in England, long-term use of e-cigarettes and long-term use of NRT are almost exclusively by current or ex-smokers. Only a minority of past-year smokers retrospectively report long-term e-cigarette or NRT use, but this figure may be an underestimate, especially for e-cigarette use, which is more than threefold higher when assessed prospectively.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

A prospective study in England.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate associations of dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes with subsequent quitting activity (smoking reduction, quit attempts and use of evidence-based cessation aids). To overcome potential confounding by factors associated with use of pharmacological support, we selected dual use of over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy (OTC NRT) and cigarettes as a behavioural control. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with 6-month follow-up. SETTING: England, 2014-2016. PARTICIPANTS: 413 current smokers participating in the Smoking Toolkit Study, a representative survey of adults in England, who reported current use of e-cigarettes or OTC NRT and provided data at 6-month follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The exposure was dual use of e-cigarettes or OTC NRT at baseline. Outcomes were change in cigarette consumption, quit attempts and use of evidence-based cessation aids during quit attempts over 6-month follow-up. Relevant sociodemographic and smoking characteristics were included as covariates. RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, dual e-cigarette users smoked two fewer cigarettes per day at follow-up than at baseline compared with dual OTC NRT users (B=2.01, 95% CI -3.62; -0.39, p=0.015). While dual e-cigarette users had 18% lower odds than dual OTC NRT users to make a quit attempt at follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.00, p=0.049), the groups did not differ in use of cessation aids (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21, p=0.388). CONCLUSIONS: Dual use of e-cigarettes is associated with a greater reduction in cigarette consumption than dual use of OTC NRT. It may discourage a small proportion of users from making a quit attempt compared with dual OTC NRT use but it does not appear to undermine use of evidence-based cessation aids.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We examined (1) anticipated responses to a hypothetical minimum price-per-cigarette/per-gram among smokers in the UK; (2) what demographic and smoker characteristics are associated with anticipated responses; and (3) whether minimum pricing may help ex-smokers stay quit. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey (May-July 2019). SETTING: UK. PARTICIPANTS: Adult cigarette smokers (n=2412) and ex-smokers (n=700). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Anticipated responses to a hypothetical minimum price of £10.00 for 20 cigarettes (£0.50 per-cigarette) and £13.50 for 30 grams of roll-your-own tobacco (£0.45 per-gram); approximately £0.10 per-cigarette/per-gram increases on the cheapest prices in leading UK supermarkets (January 2019). Smokers were presented with ten options (eg, 'Try to quit') and asked which they would do (Yes/No) and then which they would most likely do. Ex-smokers were asked to what extent the minimum prices would help them stay quit (A lot vs Lesser agreement). RESULTS: Among smokers, 55.6% said they would most likely smoke the same amount, 10.7% they would smoke less, 9.5% they would try to quit and 5.8% they would use e-cigarettes more often. Anticipated reactions were associated with demography and smoker characteristics, for example, C2DE (lower social grade) smokers were less likely than ABC1 (higher social grade) smokers to say they would smoke the same as they do now (ORAdj=0.74, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.88). Among ex-smokers, 38.5% said the minimum prices would help them stay quit 'A lot', more so among C2DE than ABC1 participants (ORAdj=1.80, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.49). CONCLUSIONS: In response to a hypothetical minimum price for cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco, approximately a fifth of smokers in the UK indicated they would smoke less or quit and almost two-fifths of ex-smokers indicated the prices would help them stay quit.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

SETTING: California PARTICIPANTS: Cases reported to California Poison Control System in 2012-2018. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Suspected nicotine toxicity; route of exposure and product characteristics. RESULTS: We examined 5277 exposures, of which 3033 involved combustible cigarettes, 1489 involved e-cigarettes and 818 involved other substances (ie, chewing tobacco, nicotine patches, nicotine lozenges, hookah, etc). Implementation of the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015 was not significantly associated with reduced exposures. Exposures for e-cigarettes increased significantly after the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Compliance Policy (p=0.003, coefficient (coeff)=0.61). Total exposures for all tobacco and nicotine products also increased significantly after the policy change (p=0.01, coeff=1.26). Nicotine exposure outcomes classified as being of minor and moderate severity increased significantly after implementation of the 2017 Compliance Policy (p=0.004, coeff=0.54 and p=0.002, coeff=0.56, respectively). Ingestion was the most common route of exposure (87.7%), followed by inhalation (8.1%), dermal (6.5%), ocular (2.1%) and other (intranasal, rectal, sublingual and unknown) routes (0.2%); some cases reported multiple routes of exposure. Exposure cases involving e-cigarettes fell into three problem categories: product design, labelling and the appeal of flavours. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis found that despite previous studies suggesting that the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act appeared to have reduced exposures for e-cigarettes, there was no significant change in exposures after its implementation. In contrast, there was a 30% increase in California e-cigarette exposures following the 2017 Compliance Policy. We conclude that current regulations are insufficient to reduce nicotine toxicities due to e-cigarette use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,Yes,

Population data on e-cigarette advertising in South Africa are needed to inform public health programs, practice and policy. We examined self-reported e-cigarette advertising exposure during 2017. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Household-based survey. PARTICIPANTS: 3063 individuals who participated in the 2017 South African Social Attitudes survey, a nationally representative, in-person survey of the non-institutionalised civilian adult population aged ≥16 years EXPOSURE: 'In the past 12 months, have you seen advertisements or promotions for e-cigarettes (including e-shisha, e-pipe) on any of the following media: newspapers/magazines, billboards, in the malls or any other source?' MAIN OUTCOMES: Beliefs and attitudes regarding e-cigarettes. FINDINGS: Participants' mean age was 37.7 years. Overall, 20.1% reported exposure to e-cigarette advertisements. By age, exposure was most prevalent among those aged 16-19 years (24.6%). Top sources of exposure among those exposed were stores, 40.7%; malls, 30.9%; and television, 32.5%. Of those aware of e-cigarettes, 61.2% believed 'e-cigarette advertisements and promotion may make adolescents think of smoking traditional cigarettes'; 62.7% believed that 'e-cigarette advertisements and promotions may make ex-smokers think of starting smoking cigarettes again'; and 59.5% supported the statement that 'e-cigarette smoking should be banned indoors just as traditional cigarette smoking'. Notably, teens aged 16-19 reported the lowest prevalence (49.0%) of those believing that 'e-cigarette advertisements and promotion may make adolescents think of smoking traditional cigarettes', whereas this percentage was highest among those aged 55-64 years (73.2%). CONCLUSION: Comprehensive regulatory efforts are needed to address e-cigarette advertising, marketing and sponsorship in order to protect public health. The urgent enactment of the new tobacco control legislation, The Control of Tobacco Products and Electronic Delivery Systems Bill, can help reduce youth exposure to e-cigarette advertising in South Africa.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

These risks can be mitigated by quitting smoking. The preoperative period represents a prime opportunity in which to administer robust smoking cessation treatment to both improve health and support and improve surgical outcomes. We will conduct a randomised clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of financial incentives delivered contingent on biochemically verified smoking abstinence (contingency management (CM)) in patients with cancer undergoing surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will take place across two study sites, and participants (N=282) who smoke, are diagnosed with or suspected to have any type of operable cancer and have a surgical procedure scheduled in the next 10 days to 5 weeks will be randomised to receive standard care plus Monitoring Only or CM prior to surgery. All patients will receive breath carbon monoxide (CO) tests three times per week, nicotine replacement therapy and counselling. The CM group will also earn payments for self-reported smoking abstinence confirmed by CO breath test ≤4 ppm on an escalating schedule of reinforcement (with a reset if they smoked). Point prevalence abstinence (PPA) outcomes (self-report of 7-day abstinence confirmed by CO≤4 ppm and/or anabasine ≤2 ng/mL) will be assessed on the day of surgery and 6 months after surgery. The effect of CM on 7-day PPA at the time of surgery and 6-month follow-up will be modelled using generalised linear mixed effects models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been reviewed and approved by the Medical University of South Carolina Institutional Review Board. We will disseminate our scientific results through traditional research-oriented outlets such as presentations at scientific meetings and publications in peer-reviewed journals.

PARTICIPANTS: In 2014, LLUH-a US academic medical centre and university-incentivised participation in a workplace smoking cessation programme (LLUH BREATHE) by lowering health plan costs. Specifically, LLUH introduced a Wholeness Health Plan (WHP) option that, for the smokers, continuously incentivises participation in nicotine screening and the LLUH BREATHE smoking cessation programme by offering an 'opt-in wellness discount' that consisted of 50%-53% lower out of pocket health plan costs (ie, monthly employee premiums, copayments). This novel 'continuously incentivised' model lowers annual health plan costs for smokers who, on an annual basis, attempt or maintain cessation from tobacco use. The annual WHP cost savings for smokers far exceed the value of short-term incentives that have been tested in workplace cessation trials to date. This ongoing health plan option offered to over 16 000 employees has created an open, dynamic LLUH BREATHE cohort of current and former smokers (n=1092). FINDINGS TO DATE: Our profile of the LLUH BREATHE cohort indicates that after 5 years of follow-up in a prospective cohort study (2014-2019), continuously incentivised smoking cessation produced a 74% participation (95% CI (71% to 77%)) in employer-sponsored smoking cessation attempts that were occurring less than a year after the incentive was offered. The cohort can be purposed to examine the effect of continuously incentivised cessation on cessation outcomes, health plan utilisation/costs, use of electronic nicotine delivery systems, and COVID-19 outcomes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

DESIGN: Young adults aged 18-34 years (N=1225) were surveyed cross-sectionally via online Qualtrics panel. The survey assessed recall and belief in three claims about nicotine and COVID-19 and three about nicotine in general followed by assessments of industry beliefs and use of social media. Ordinal logistic regression with robust standard errors controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, education, current e-cigarette use and age was used to examine relationships between variables. RESULTS: Twitter use was associated with higher odds of recall (OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.01 to 1.44) and belief (OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.04 to 1.52) in COVID-19-specific distorted science. YouTube use was associated with higher odds of believing COVID-19-specific distorted science (OR=1.32, 95% CI=1.09 to 1.60). Reddit use was associated with lower odds of believing COVID-19-specific distorted science (OR=0.72, 95% CI=0.59 to 0.88). Recall (OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.07 to 1.47) and belief (OR=1.28, 95% CI=1.09 to 1.50) in distorted science about nicotine in general as well as belief in distorted science specific to COVID-19 (OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.34 to 1.95) were associated with more positive beliefs about the tobacco industry. Belief in distorted science about nicotine in general was also associated with more negative beliefs about the tobacco industry (OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.02 to 1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Use of social media platforms may help to both spread and dispel distorted science about nicotine. Addressing distorted science about nicotine is important, as it appears to be associated with more favourable views of the tobacco industry which may erode public support for effective regulation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Tobacco advertising has historically used flavours as an advertising tactic, but little is known about flavour type and prevalence in ENDS advertisements. We assess the presence of flavoured ENDS in ads over time, by media outlet (eg, magazines, online) and brand. METHODS: We acquired ENDS ads (N=4546) that first ran between 2015-2017 (n=1685; study 1) and 2018-2020 (n=2861; study 2) in outlets including opt-in emails, direct-to-consumer mail (study 1 only), video (TV and online), radio (study 2 only), static online/mobile (ie, ads without video or moving graphics), social media, outdoor (eg, billboards; study 2 only) and consumer magazines. We coded for presence of flavoured ENDS products and flavour type (eg, fruit, tobacco, menthol) and merged this information with metadata on ad year, outlet and manufacturer/retailer brand. RESULTS: Overall, nearly half (45.5%; n=2067) of ads in our sample featured a flavoured product. Tobacco (59.1%; n=1221), menthol (42.9%; n=887) and fruit (38.6%; n=797) were the most advertised flavours. Over time, the proportion of ads containing tobacco-flavoured and menthol-flavoured ENDS generally decreased before menthol rebounded in 2020. The proportion of ads containing fruit, mint and dessert flavours generally increased over time, with a substantive drop in 2020. We found notable differences in flavoured ENDS advertising by outlet and brand. CONCLUSIONS: The overall presence of flavoured ENDS in our sample of ads remained relatively consistent, with tobacco flavour decreasing over time and some non-tobacco flavours increasing over time until 2020 when the presence decreased.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

DESIGN: Semistructured discussion groups. SUBJECTS: Twenty focus groups with 82 young people aged 11-16 living in the Central belt of Scotland. METHODS: Youths were asked about smoking and vaping behaviours, social media use, vaping advertisement exposure and were shown illustrative examples of social media content (eg, images and videos) about different messages, presentations and contextual features. Transcripts were imported into NVivo V.12, coded thematically and analysed. RESULTS: Youths highlighted a variety of tactics e-cigarette companies use, including influencer or celebrity endorsement, attractive youth flavours, bright colours and emotional appeal to advertise and promote their products directly to young people. Social media influencers who advertise e-cigarettes were described as portraying e-cigarettes as 'cool' and 'fashionable' to entice viewers to try the products. Youths considered that there is a need for more restrictions on social media content to protect youths while also still allowing smokers to purchase them as a cessation device. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights that the e-cigarette industry is using previously employed tactics similar to the tobacco industry to advertise and promote its products on social media. These findings suggest the growing need for governments to work together to develop and implement policies to restrict the advertising and marketing of e-cigarettes on social media.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

DESIGN: In-depth interviews were conducted to explore ASEAN tobacco control experts' (n=11) views on the rise of NVP use in ASEAN LMICs, current NVP policies, the potential harm reduction and smoking cessation utilities of these devices, and what implications they may have for tobacco control. Data were analysed using inductive, reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five themes emerged: (1) NVPs threaten tobacco control in ASEAN LMICs; (2) commercial factors influence youth appeal and access: product attributes, marketing, supply chains; (3) opposition to the smoking cessation and harm reduction utilities of NVPs; (4) policies are inconsistent and fragmented in the region; and (5) tobacco industry power and tactics have been used to capture NVP markets. CONCLUSIONS: ASEAN tobacco control experts believe that NVPs pose a threat to youth and non-smokers in LMICs in the region, largely because of tobacco industry NVP marketing activities. They do not support the use of NVPs for smoking cessation or harm reduction and call for more restrictions and consistent policy enforcement across the region to protect young people, while also cautiously recognising that use of NVPs may have some benefits for smokers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Evidence suggests that most people begin smoking or become habitual smokers before reaching adulthood. This highlights the need for a smoking prevention intervention focused on young people. ASSIST (A Stop Smoking In Schools Trial) is a 'peer-led', school-based smoking prevention intervention, shown to be effective in the UK. The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a full-scale effectiveness evaluation of an adapted version of the ASSIST intervention in China, Indonesia or the Philippines. However, due to issues with obtaining relevant approvals, China was removed from the trial with the approval of the funder and Trial Steering Committee, and the study will only be completed in Indonesia and the Philippines. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A feasibility mixed-methods cluster randomised controlled trial in 10 schools (six intervention, four control) in each of the two countries. Participants will be students aged c13-14 in mainstream ('lower secondary') schools. In addition to their usual education on smoking, intervention schools will receive the ASSIST intervention which is based on 'diffusion of innovation' theory, with new norms and behaviours promoted through: (1) peer modelling by locally influential individuals; and (2) information disseminated by them through their social networks. Control schools will continue with their usual education around smoking prevention.The key outcome of the study is whether prespecified progression criteria relating to recruitment, retention, acceptability and feasibility have been met in order to progress to a larger cluster randomised controlled effectiveness trial in one or more of the countries. A mixed-methods process evaluation will assess acceptability, feasibility and fidelity of intervention delivery, exposure to and reach of the intervention. The feasibility of trial processes including outcome measurement will be assessed. An economic evaluation will estimate the costs of the ASSIST intervention. Statistical analyses will focus on feasibility criteria, and qualitative data will be analysed using a framework approach. Outcomes assessed will include self-reported smoking behaviour (own and that of friends and family); vaping and other forms of nicotine use; smoking-related attitudes and knowledge; smoking norms; self-esteem; self-efficacy; (all at baseline and 7 month follow-up) and exhaled carbon monoxide concentration (at follow-up only). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has been approved by the University of Glasgow College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences (MVLS) Ethics Committee (ref: 200210204), the De La Salle University Research Ethics Review Committee (ref: 2023-012C) and the Medical and Health Research Ethics Committee (MHREC); Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing; Universitas Gadjah Mada (ref: KE/FK/1205/EC/2022). The trial is sponsored by the University of Glasgow (Head of Research Regulation and Compliance-debra.stuart@glasgow.ac.uk). The sponsor will not have input in data collection, management, analysis and interpretation; write up and submissions for publication.The study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications in expert journals and conference presentations and targeted communications to schools, policymakers and the public.

Indigenous peoples experience a disproportionate burden of commercial tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Over the past two decades, significant progress has been made in reducing smoking prevalence among Indigenous peoples; however, smoking remains a leading contributor to the burden of death and disease. This review will summarise evidence on commercial tobacco resistance and/or eradication strategies, including policy reforms, in relation to Indigenous peoples across Oceania, the Pacific Islands and North America. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This review will follow guidelines from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews and will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews. This review will consider academic and grey literature published since 1 January 2000. The following electronic databases will be searched for relevant primary research articles and commentaries: PubMed, Scopus, Informit, Web of Science and PsycINFO. Additional searches will be conducted in ProQuest to identify relevant grey literature. Papers will be screened by two reviewers to determine eligibility, followed by full-text data extraction. Findings will be synthesised descriptively for each review question and by region. Studies included in the review will be assessed against criteria for Indigenous engagement in research. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol was led by Indigenous interests, needs and rights of Indigenous peoples, consistent with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and ethical practice. This review was conceptualised with Indigenous leadership and through engagement, including but not limited to the Indigenous lived experience of the authors (MK, E-ST, HC, PNH, PH, SAM, AW, SW and RM). This review supports the global goal of eradicating commercial tobacco-related harms - reframing commercial tobacco use as a structurally imposed harm sustained by colonial and commercial forces rather than personal choice. Findings from this review will be shared with Indigenous partners and communities who requested this work and will be submitted for peer-reviewed publication.

Small airway injury is suspected to be a direct consequence of e-cigarette use and may be quantifiable by novel structural and functional diagnostic modalities. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a multicentre observational longitudinal study, participants will be enrolled in either an adolescent (ages ≥12 and <19 years) or an adult arm (≥19 years old) and followed over 3 years across three time points (baseline, 18 months and 36 months). In the adolescent arm, a total of 50 e-cigarette and 50 non-e-cigarette users will be enrolled across 4 sites. In the adult arm, a total of 100 e-cigarette users, 100 non-e-cigarette users, and an additional 100 combustible cigarette-only users and 100 dual combustible cigarette-e-cigarette users will be enrolled across 5 sites. Participants will undergo respiratory questionnaires, pulmonary function tests, oscillometry, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, hyperpolarised 129-xenon gas MRI and blood collection. In adolescent participants only, multiple breath washout and induced sputum collection will be performed. Adult participants will also undergo inspiratory/expiratory chest CT and bronchoscopy. The primary endpoint will be a composite of small airway dysfunction according to oscillometry, cardiopulmonary testing and/or chest imaging parameters. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been approved by The University of British Columbia-Providence Health Care Research Ethics Board (Certificate H24-00374). The use of hyperpolarised 129-xenon gas in this study has been approved by Health Canada (Certificate HC6-024-c291776). Written documentation of informed consent will be required prior to study initiation. We will seek to enrol adolescent participants who are capable of providing informed consent with an optional support statement from a parent encouraged but not required. Study findings will be disseminated to medical/scientific audiences through scientific conferences and published manuscripts respecting the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement, to youths through outreach events at high schools and community programmes and through social media, and to adults through lung health community events.

To date, there is little evidence on use among young people across countries. This study aimed to assess pouch use among young people in four countries with differing regulatory contexts. METHODS: Data were analysed from repeat cross-sectional surveys conducted in 2022, 2023 and 2024 with national samples of youth aged 16-19 and young adults aged 20-29 in Canada, England, the USA and New Zealand (NZ) (N=44 736). We assessed trends in awareness and use of nicotine pouches (2022-2024), as well as correlates and reasons for use (2024), using adjusted and unadjusted regression models. RESULTS: Across all countries, awareness of nicotine pouches increased among youth and young adults between 2022 and 2024 (all p<0.001). In 2024, approximately 5% of youth in Canada, the USA and NZ, and 10% in England, reported ever using pouches; past 30-day use ranged from 1.6% in NZ to 4.0% in England. Among young adults, ever use ranged from 9.1% (Canada) to 18.7% (England), and past 30-day use ranged from 3.0% (NZ) to 7.9% (USA). Across all countries, the prevalence of ever use did not change significantly between 2022 and 2023 among youth (p=0.18) or young adults (p=0.54), but increased from 2023 to 2024 among both age groups (p<0.001). Past 30-day use increased between 2022 and 2023 among youth (p=0.03) but not young adults (p=0.57), and increased from 2023 to 2024 among both (p<0.001). Use was more prevalent among males and those who used other tobacco/nicotine products. The most common reasons for using pouches among youth were curiosity, ease of use without being noticed and fun; and among young adults, were dealing with stress/anxiety, curiosity and less harmful than smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of nicotine pouch use among young people has increased in all four countries. Continued monitoring of these products is warranted.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, there is limited understanding of teachable/treatable moments (specific times when individuals may be particularly open to behavioural change) to support smoking cessation in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Therefore, we aimed to investigate which health events could create treatable moments for nicotine dependence in these patients. METHODS: Patients aged ≥18 years, chronically using medication for obstructive lung diseases between 2017 and 2022 and currently smoking tobacco were identified in Belgian nationwide administrative health data. The impact of potential triggering events on evidence-based cessation attempts (reimbursed tobacco counselling or cessation medication) was investigated by multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Additional analyses stratified by care setting where cessation was attempted (inpatient vs outpatient), restricted to a first attempt, incident triggering events only and stratified by hospital label (no label, asthma or COPD separately) were conducted. RESULTS: Among 94 788 chronic users of pulmonary medication (mean age 61.6 years, 49% female), 12 499 (13.2%) patients attempted smoking cessation. Severe exacerbations (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.82, 95% CI 1.73 to 1.90), use of antidepressants (aHR 1.70, 95% CI 1.64 to 1.76), smoking-related cancer (aHR 1.42, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.52), peripheral vascular disease (aHR 1.42, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.49), admission to critical care (aHR 1.42, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.49), spirometry testing (aHR 1.33, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.38), acute myocardial infarction (aHR 1.32, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.44) and stroke (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.38) were associated with a significantly increased likelihood of smoking cessation attempt by more than 25%. All additional analyses confirmed the main findings. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide cohort study, we have identified significant treatable moments for smoking cessation beyond established triggering events (eg, stroke and acute myocardial infarction). Exacerbations and spirometry testing were associated with a significantly increased chance of a smoking cessation attempt.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

DESIGN: Cross-sectional design. SETTING: South Africa has progressively passed several policies over the past few decades to encourage smoking cessation. Data on cessation behaviours are needed to inform policymaking. We investigated utilisation of evidence-based cessation aids and e-cigarettes among current combustible smokers. Current tobacco use, past quit attempts and use of evidence-based cessation aids (counselling, nicotine replacement therapy or prescription medication) were self-reported. Data were weighted and analysed using descriptive and multivariable approaches (p<0.05). PARTICIPANTS: Online participants were recruited from the national consumer database for News24-South Africa's largest digital publisher. Of the 18 208 participants aged 18 years or older, there were 5657 current smokers of any combustible tobacco product (cigarettes, cigars, pipes or roll-your-own cigarettes), including 4309 who had ever attempted to quit during their lifetime. RESULTS: Current combustible tobacco smoking prevalence was 22.4% (95% CI: 21.2% to 23.5%), and 98.7% of all current smokers of any combustible tobacco were current cigarette smokers. Awareness of cessation aids was as follows among current combustible tobacco smokers: smoking cessation counselling programmes, 50.8% (95% CI: 48.1% to 53.6%); nicotine replacement therapy, 92.1% (95% CI: 90.5% to 93.6%); prescription cessation medication, 68.2% (95% CI: 65.2% to 70.6%). Awareness of cessation aids was lowest among Black Africans, men, and persons with little or no income. Of all current combustible tobacco smokers, 74.6% (95% CI: 72.2% to 76.7%) had ever attempted to quit and 42.8% (95% CI: 40.0% to 45.4%) of these quit attempters had ever used any cessation aid. Among current combustible smokers who attempted to quit in the past, ever e-cigarette users were more likely than never e-cigarette users to have ever used any cessation aid (50.6% vs 35.9%, p<0.05). Of current combustible smokers intending to quit, 66.7% (95% CI: 64.2% to 68.9%) indicated interest in using a cessation aid for future quitting. By specific aids, 24.7% (95% CI: 21.3% to 28.1%) of those planning to use any cessation aid were interested in getting help from a pharmacist, 44.6% (95% CI: 40.9% to 48.4%) from a doctor, 49.8% (95% CI: 46.0% to 53.6%) from someone who had successfully quit, 30.0% (95% CI: 26.7% to 33.4%) from a family member and 26.5% (95% CI: 23.0% to 30.0%) from web resources. CONCLUSION: Only two in five past quit attempters had ever used counselling/pharmacotherapy. Any putative benefits of e-cigarettes on cessation may be partly attributable to pharmacotherapy/counselling given concurrent use patterns among past quit attempters using e-cigarettes. Comprehensive tobacco control and prevention strategies can help reduce aggregate tobacco consumption.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

This study assessed trends in ENDS advertisement (ad) expenditures in the USA from 2015 to 2020 overall, by media channel and by advertiser. METHODS: Data came from Numerator, which conducts surveillance of ads and estimates expenditures. The estimates are dollars spent (adjusted to 2020) by the advertiser for each ad occurrence for print, radio, television and digital (online, mobile) media channels. ENDS ad expenditures were assessed by quarter, media channel and the top five advertisers based on ad occurrences. RESULTS: Overall ENDS ad expenditures increased from $38 million in 2015 to $217 million in 2019 before decreasing to a low of $22 million in 2020. By media channel, print expenditures led the channels with more than twice as much spent as television, four times more than radio and 10 times more than digital. By advertiser, JUUL led in ENDS ad expenditures from 2015 to 2020 with almost $189 million spent, followed by British American Tobacco (BAT, $105 million) and Imperial Tobacco ($62 million). CONCLUSIONS: Overall ad expenditures were relatively stable from 2015 to mid-2018 when large expenditures by JUUL and subsequent expenditures by BAT and Imperial Tobacco led to expenditure highs in 2019. E-cigarette and vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI), the JUUL self-imposed ad suspension and COVID-19 likely all played a role in advertising lows in 2020. The absence of popular Puff Bar brand ads from the traditional media channels studied highlights the importance of monitoring direct and indirect advertising on newer media channels like social media.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

FDA concluded that RJR demonstrated Vuse products met the statutory standard of providing a net benefit to public health. A review of FDA's scientific justification reveals deficiencies: (1) not adequately considering Vuse's popularity with youth and evidence that e-cigarettes expanded the nicotine market and stimulate cigarette smoking; (2) trading youth addiction for unproven adult benefit without quantifying these risks and benefits; (3) not considering design factors that appeal to youth; (4) not addressing evidence that e-cigarettes used as consumer products do not help smokers quit and promote relapse in former smokers; (5) not discussing evidence that dual use is more dangerous than smoking; (6) narrowly focusing on the fact that e-cigarettes deliver lower levels of some toxicants without addressing direct evidence on adverse health effects; (7) downplaying significant evidence of other substantial harms; (8) not acting on FDA's own study showing no all-cause mortality benefit of reducing (but not stopping) cigarette use; and (9) improperly considering e-cigarettes' high abuse liability and potential for high youth addiction and undermining tobacco cessation. Because marketing these products is not appropriate for the protection of the public health, FDA should reconsider its Vuse marketing order as statutorily required and not use it as a template for other e-cigarette PMTAs. Policymakers outside the USA should anticipate that tobacco companies will use FDA's decision to try to weaken tobacco control regulation of e-cigarettes and promote their products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

Study results can inform regulation of e-cigarettes. METHODOLOGY: Warning letters retrieved from FDA's website were coded for company type (retailer, manufacturer or distributor), location (domestic or international), infractions listed (PMTA (premarket tobacco product application), selling to minors, advertising to youth or packaging violation/mislabelling), product type (e-liquid, device or both), flavour (fruit, candy, tobacco, menthol/mint, concept flavour) and consequence (civil money penalties, product seizure and injunction, product detention and refusal of entry to the USA, no-tobacco-sales order, criminal prosecution). RESULTS: Of 303 coded letters (126 from 2020 and 177 from 2021), 97.4% were sent to small online retailers. Overall, 94.1% of the companies cited were located within the USA, 75.2% of the infractions were identified by reviewing a company's website and 70.5% were PMTA violations. In 2020, 55.6% of infractions were PMTA violations; in 2021, nearly all infractions were PMTA violations. The letters cited 880 products; 92.2% of which were e-liquid products, with 32.4% fruit and 31.1% concept flavours. DISCUSSION: Warning letters targeted small online retailers rather than large e-cigarette brands or products most used by youth: pod mods and disposables. The focus of these enforcement actions comprises a small share of the market and the impact on use was likely minimal. With PMTA decisions pending for the largest brands of e-cigarettes, the FDA should use its enforcement powers to target manufacturers, distributors and sellers of the tobacco products that have the greatest impact on youth and products that provide no public health benefit.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

(Altria, August 2016) and Velo (RJ Reynolds, July 2019)-we examined (1) general advertising characteristics (eg, media type, year); (2) ad content (ie, headlines and imagery themes); (3) prominent media channels (ie, specific websites, magazines, etc); and (4) ad expenditures. RESULTS: There were 286 unique ads (Zyn: 44.4%; On!: 2.8%; Velo: 52.8%), 119 143 occurrences (Zyn: 3.5%; On!: 0.5%; Velo: 96.0%) and $24 774 650 total expenditures (Zyn: 4.7%; On!: 0.6%; Velo: 94.7%).

This paper considers a 'standardised cigarettes' policy as a potential next step in restricting tobacco marketing. This policy would remove from cigarette products all the elements that increase their appeal and addictiveness: added flavours, nicotine, and visual designs and branding. The result would be a cigarette that is flavourless, not especially addicting, and visually off-putting. This paper discusses what a standardised cigarettes policy might look like from a regulatory standpoint, and how it fits into current policy obligations under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In the last decade, e-cigarette designs have evolved through four generations that include modifications in battery power, e-cigarette liquid (e-liquid) reservoirs and atomiser units. E-liquids have likewise evolved in terms of solvent use/ratios, concentration and number of flavour chemicals, use of nicotine salts and acids, the recent increased use of synthetic cooling agents and the introduction of synthetic nicotine. Our current objective was to evaluate and compare the evolving composition of tobacco-flavoured e-liquids over the last 10 years. METHODS: Our extensive database of flavour chemicals in e-liquids was used to identify trends and changes in flavour chemical composition and concentrations. RESULTS: Tobacco-flavoured products purchased in 2010 and 2011 generally had very few flavour chemicals, and their concentrations were generally very low. In tobacco-flavoured refill fluids purchased in 2019 and Puff Bar Tobacco e-cigarettes, the total number and concentration of flavour chemicals were higher than expected. Products with total flavour chemicals >10 mg/mL contained one to five dominant flavour chemicals (>1 mg/mL). The most frequently used flavour chemicals in tobacco e-liquids were fruity and caramellic. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for continuous surveillance of e-liquids, which are evolving in often subtle and harmful ways. Chemical constituents of tobacco flavours should be monitored as they clearly can be doctored by manufacturers to have a taste that would appeal to young users.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

Thus, digital discourse surveillance may be an effective and unobtrusive way of understanding industry and public response to policies and regulations, including in the domain of tobacco control. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration restricted sales of flavoured cartridge and disposable vape products. Historically, the tobacco industry used modification of product characteristics, labelling or packaging to work around flavour restrictions. We aimed to characterise strategies used by nicotine product manufacturers and vendors to promote flavoured products on Instagram and to identify policy workaround tactics. METHODS: Keyword rules were used to collect flavoured electronic cigarette-related Instagram posts from CrowdTangle, from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2021. Posts were coded for commercial content and promotional strategies using a combination of machine learning methods, keyword algorithms and human coding. Additional exploratory analyses were conducted to identify major discussion themes. Non-English posts were excluded from the analyses. RESULTS: Keyword filters captured 113 393 relevant posts from 391 unique accounts, with 46 076 posts referencing flavour promotion (40.6%) and 2124 (2%) posts mentioning alternatives to restricted flavoured products or strategies to evade flavour sales restrictions. Promotional messages featured non-characterising flavour references, 'off-brand' product substitutes, promotion of new flavoured product technologies, innovation, do-it-yourself appeals, global promotion, international delivery and encouraged flavoured product stockpiling. In addition, promotion of refillable devices, e-juice, tank systems and 'box mod' vaporizers was present. CONCLUSION: Social media surveillance can enhance our understanding of public health needs and policy compliance, as well as inform strategies to prevent policy evasion. Examining evolving industry tactics to promote flavoured products in response to regulatory changes can help authorities and practitioners assess policy effectiveness and inform future design and implementation approaches.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Six databases were searched for systematic reviews presenting evidence on ENDS-related health effects. Ninety reviews divided into five categories were included: toxicity=20, health effects=40, role in smoking cessation=24, role in transition to combustible cigarettes (CCs)=13 and industry marketing claims=4. DATA EXTRACTION: Findings were synthesised in narrative summaries. Meta-analyses were conducted by study type when appropriate. Quality assessment was conducted using the Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews. The Institute of Medicine's Levels of Evidence Framework was used to classify the evidence into high-level, moderate, limited-suggestive and limited-not-conclusive. DATA SYNTHESIS: We found high-level evidence that ENDS exposes users to toxic substances; increases the risk of respiratory disease; leads to nicotine dependence; causes serious injuries due to explosion or poisoning; increases smoking cessation in clinical trials but not in observational studies; increases CC initiation; and exposure to ENDS marketing increases its use/intention to use. Evidence was moderate for ENDS association with mental health and substance use, limited-suggestive for cardiovascular, and limited-not-conclusive for cancer, ear, ocular and oral diseases, and pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: As evidence is accumulating, ENDS communication can focus on high-level evidence on ENDS association with toxicity, nicotine addiction, respiratory disease, ENDS-specific harm (explosion, poisoning) and anti-ENDS industry sentiment. Direct comparison between the harm of CCs and ENDS should be avoided.

In response to the popularity of JUUL and similar devices among youth, the US Food and Drug Administration issued in February 2020 an enforcement policy to remove all flavoured cartridge/pod-based e-cigarettes from the market except for tobacco and menthol. Subsequent studies showed that some users of the now-removed flavoured JUUL pods (especially cool mint) switched to menthol-flavoured JUUL pods with similar satisfaction. METHODS: We quantified menthol, nicotine, propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerol (VG) in JUUL pod samples (Menthol, Classic Menthol and Cool Mint) that were purchased in 2017, 2018 and 2020 (only Menthol) to evaluate composition differences before and after the enforcement policy. We also analysed the samples to detect other cooling agents using a screening gas chromatography-mass spectrometry headspace method that we developed for this purpose. RESULTS: Menthol concentration was significantly higher in 2020 products than in products from prior years. Moreover, other cooling agents varied across pods. The PG/VG volume ratio was 27/63 in all pods examined. CONCLUSION: This study highlights how regulations intended to reduce e-cigarette prevalence among youth may influence changes in tobacco product characteristics in ways that regulators may not have foreseen.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The study aims to assess e-cigarette promotional frequency and content on social media in Indonesia. METHODS: Monitoring was conducted on Instagram in October 2021. A total of 45 Instagram influencer accounts were monitored to assess the frequency of posting and interactions from 4 to 20 October for InstaStories and from 4 to 31 October for Instagram Feeds. Content analysis was carried out on 310 posts collected from 10 randomly selected accounts from 1 to 31 October (one post per account per day) to evaluate the form, type and characteristics of the promotions. RESULTS: There were a total of 2 897 327 followers across the 45 Instagram accounts. On average, the 45 accounts posted about 185 stories and 43 feed posts per day. Of the 310 feed posts analysed from 10 randomly selected accounts, 64% featured images of women; 50% highlighted or displayed the product; and 32% showed enjoyment of the product flavours. CONCLUSIONS: The tobacco industry has successfully taken advantage of the e-cigarette promotion regulatory void. The Indonesian government needs to ban the promotion of these products, including those on online platforms.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We describe smoking behaviour and exposure after switching to a cigarette brand variant (CBV) with a different FV level. METHODS: Wave 1 (2013-2014) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco Use and Health Study was merged with FV levels of participants' CBV and restricted to adults with a usual CBV, smoked daily and included in wave 4 (2016-2017; n=371). Generalised estimation equations method modelled changes in FV and cigarettes per day (CPD), quit interest, total nicotine equivalents (TNE) and total NNAL (biomarker of a tobacco-specific carcinogen). FV change was defined as a change in CBV resulting in a ≥20% increase or decrease in FV. Secondary analyses used FV change based on an increase from <5% to >10% or a decrease from >10% to <5%. RESULTS: A non-significant pattern indicating an increase of 0.97 and 0.49 CPD was observed among those who switched to a CBV and increased FV by ≥20% and from <5% to >10%, respectively. A non-significant pattern indicating a decrease of 1.31 and 1.97 CPD was observed among those who decreased FV by ≥20% and from >10% to <5%, respectively. Changes in quit interest and biomarkers were also non-significant with one exception: greater reduction in TNE among those who decreased from >10% to <5% FV versus no change (-8.51 vs -0.25 nmol/mg creatinine; p=0.0447). CONCLUSIONS: Switching to CBV with lower FV does not appear to increase exposure and may even reduce exposure for some. Additional investigations are recommended to confirm these descriptive findings.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Most adults who vape report interest in quitting. The present study examined level of interest in e-cigarette cessation between users with varying cigarette smoking histories and device types. METHODS: Data obtained from wave 5 (2018-2019) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study (n=34 309). Analyses were conducted on adult current established e-cigarette users, categorised on cigarette smoking history (current, former or never) and device type (disposable, cartridge/pod, tank or mod). Participants reported if they planned to ever quit e-cigarettes, attempted to quit in the past year and attempted to quit by cutting back in the past year. RESULTS: Of the 2922 established e-cigarette users, 68.21% reported plans to quit vaping; 17.27% reported attempting to quit e-cigarettes in the past year; and 29.28% reported attempting to quit by cutting back in the past year. Cartridge users had higher odds of interest in quitting than tank and mod users. Disposable and cartridge users had higher odds of reporting a past year quit attempt than tank and mod users. Individuals with no smoking history had higher odds of reporting a past year quit attempt or cutting back relative to those reporting dual use (of both e-cigarettes and cigarettes) and former smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco control should consider the type of e-cigarette device that is being used, alongside users' cigarette smoking history, when developing interventions and other resources for vaping cessation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Salient features of the Vuse Solo product such as nicotine form, draw resistance, power regulation and electrical characteristics have not been reported previously, and few studies have examined the nicotine and other toxicant emissions of this product. We investigated the design characteristics and toxicant emissions of the Solo as well as Alto, another Vuse product with a greater market share than Solo. METHODS: Total/freebase nicotine, propylene glycol to vegetable glycerin ratio, carbonyl compounds (CC) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified by gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence from aerosol emissions generated in 15 puffs of 4 s duration. The electric power control system was also analysed. RESULTS: The average power delivered was 2.1 W and 3.9 W for Solo and Alto; neither system was temperature-controlled. Vuse Solo and Alto, respectively, emitted nicotine at a rate of 38 µg/s and 115 µg/s, predominantly in the protonated form (>90%). Alto's ROS yield was similar to a combustible cigarette and one order of magnitude greater than that of Solo. Total carbonyls from both products were two orders of magnitude lower than combustible cigarettes. CONCLUSION: Vuse Solo is an above-Ohm ENDS that emits approximately one-third the nicotine flux of a Marlboro Red cigarette (129 µg/s) and considerably lower CC and ROS yields than a combustible cigarette. With its higher power, the nicotine flux and ROS yield from Alto are similar to Marlboro Red levels; Alto may thus present greater abuse liability than the lower sales-volume Solo.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The nicotine may either be derived from tobacco plants or synthetically produced. Nicotine pouches are available worldwide, but little is known as to how various countries regulate these products. This study summarises nicotine pouch regulatory policies across 67 countries. METHODS: This research summarises insights obtained through active policy surveillance work in which we requested information on the availability of nicotine pouches and applicable policies and analysed responses from representatives of 67 countries (representatives included subject matter experts in government or civil society organisations). These countries span all WHO regions. RESULTS: We found significant variation in how countries classify nicotine pouches, with many countries' current regulatory approach failing to regulate nicotine pouches that used synthetic nicotine. We found 34 countries regulate nicotine pouches with 23 of these countries' policies encompassing synthetic nicotine. Countries regulating both synthetic and tobacco-derived nicotine pouches generally (1) rely on existing policies for tobacco products and/or medicines or (2) have developed new policies or regulatory classifications that specify nicotine as the substance at issue rather than linking policies solely to tobacco. CONCLUSION: Our work offers novel insight into nicotine pouch markets and national regulatory approaches. Policy approaches vary from not regulating nicotine pouches at all to banning both forms of nicotine pouches. Policies used by countries regulating both tobacco-derived and synthetic nicotine pouches offer a roadmap for how other jurisdictions can add effective guardrails to the use of these and other non-medicinal nicotine products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: Through QCC.com, one of the largest enterprise information query platforms in China, we identified 104 official manufacturer websites in 2021. A codebook including 6 sections with 31 items was developed and all webpages were coded separately by two trained researchers. RESULTS: Over half of the websites (56.7%) did not have age verification for entry. Thirty-two (30.8%) websites had no restriction for minors to use or purchase e-cigarettes, and 79 (76.0%) had no health warning. Overall, 99 websites (95.2%) displayed their products, and 72 (69.2%) displayed e-flavours. The most frequently used descriptions of products included good taste (68.3%), positive mood (62.5%), leakage resistance (56.7%), enjoyment (47.1%), reduced harm (45.2%), alternatives to cigarettes (43.3%) and long battery life (42.3%). Additionally, 75 websites (72.1%) provided contact information on different channels, including WeChat (59.6%), Weibo (41.3%), Facebook (13.5%), Instagram (12.5%) and brand apps (2.9%). Manufacturers provided investment and franchise information (59.6%) and offline store information (17.3%). In addition, 41.3% websites included content regarding corporate social responsibility. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese e-cigarette manufacturers' official websites have become a platform for presenting product and brand information, establishing online and offline marketing loops, and displaying corporate social responsibility with weak age restrictions on access and a lack of health warnings.

DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Embase and African Index Medicus for published articles from January 1996 to August 2018 in any language. STUDY SELECTION: Two researchers independently reviewed titles and abstracts for a focus on nicotine or tobacco product(s) and describe data or recommendations specific to Africa. Ultimately, 818 articles were identified. DATA EXTRACTION: Three independent coders conducted qualitative analyses of articles and extracted funders, study populations, countries of research focus, research topics, tobacco products, study design and data source. A bibliometric analysis estimated coauthorship networks between the countries of authors' primary institutional affiliation. DATA SYNTHESIS: All 54 African countries were represented in two or more articles. The coauthorship network included 2714 unique authors representing 90 countries. Most articles employed a cross-sectional study design with primary data collection, focused on cigarettes and studied use behaviour. Few articles examined tobacco farming or interventions for cessation or prevention. The most frequently cited funder was the US National Institutes of Health (27.2%). A range of coauthorship patterns existed between African institutions with some coauthoring with one institution while others coauthored with 761 institutions in other African countries. CONCLUSIONS: The literature review identified the need for implementation research for tobacco control interventions and policies, economic and development impacts of tobacco use research, and tobacco industry and tobacco production and farming research.

METHODS: We analysed 14 000 e-liquid products from five major online e-cigarette retailers between April and May 2021 to determine the association between price discounts and product attributes such as nicotine level and form, flavour and vegetable glycerine/propylene glycol ratio. A fixed-effects model was used in the analysis and discounts were calculated in US cents/mL of e-liquid volume. RESULTS: Out of 14 407 e-liquid products, 92.5% were offered at a discounted price. On average, the price discount for the 13 324 products that had discounts was 16.84 cents/mL across the five stores. Among the three forms of nicotine (salt, freebase and nicotine free), salt e-liquids had the highest average price discount. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that e-liquids with salt nicotine have a higher average price discount when sold online, which may influence consumer purchasing behaviour. Further research is needed to assess the potential impact of these discounts on youth and adult tobacco use. Policymakers may consider implementing measures to limit online price discounts for e-liquids as a means of reducing sales among young people.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

As a result, several countries have banned use of menthol as a characterising flavour. Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) could disallow menthol-flavoured cigarettes as part of its endgame legislation; however, little is known about the NZ menthol market. METHODS: To examine the NZ menthol market, we analysed tobacco company returns to the Ministry of Health from 2010 to 2021. We calculated the market share of menthol cigarettes as a percentage of total cigarettes released for sale, estimated capsule cigarettes' market share as a percentage of total cigarette released for sale and menthol released for sale, and calculated menthol roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco released for sale as a percentage of total RYO released. RESULTS: Menthol brands accounted for a relatively small but nonetheless sizeable proportion of NZ's tobacco market and in 2021 constituted 13% of NZ's factory made cigarette market and 7% of the RYO market, representing 161 million cigarettes and 25 tonnes of RYO. The introduction of capsule technologies using menthol flavours corresponded with a rise in menthol sales among factory made cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: Capsule technologies using menthol flavours work synergistically to enhance the appeal of smoking and appear likely to encourage experimentation among non-smoking young people. Comprehensive policy that regulates menthol flavours and innovations used to deliver flavour sensations will support tobacco endgame goals in NZ and could inform policy in other countries.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Little is known about the official use of social media in marketing heated tobacco products (HTPs). This study examined Philip Morris International's (PMI) social media marketing globally of its leading HTP, IQOS. METHODS: PMI IQOS country-specific official websites were accessed (N=59) in May to September 2022 and social media accounts listed were recorded. Accounts were then coded for their number of posts in the past month and year and for their number of subscribers. Posts on online accounts with at least one past-month post were categorised to describe the post's function: instructional, general advertising, price promotions or event promotions. RESULTS: Of the 59 country websites, 45 (76.3%) listed at least one social media account; of these, an average of 2.5 accounts (SD=0.8) were listed. Across websites, 111 accounts were identified: 42 Facebook, 23 YouTube, 21 Twitter, 19 Instagram, 2 Telegram, 1 LinkedIn, 1 KakaoTalk, 1 VK and 1 LINE. Across YouTube, Twitter and Instagram, accounts made 2550 past-year posts and had ~490 961 subscribers. Of the 165 past-month posts, 101 (60.1%) functioned as general advertising, 30 (17.9%) instructional, 29 (17.3%) event promotions and 8 (4.8%) price promotions.

This study aimed to determine how TCs are using third-party awards to frame themselves and their core activities via company-controlled communication channels. METHODS: TC-owned media coverage promoting third-party awards was identified from company-owned media channels, including websites, reports, press releases and Twitter. Using framing theory and thematic analysis, frames and broader themes were identified using a process of inductive coding. RESULTS: TC-produced media content promoting third-party awards framed the companies as socially and environmentally responsible organisations, which excel at business and are innovative and transformative. Dominant frames identified included excellent workplace culture, championing diversity and inclusion and action on the environment. CONCLUSION: TCs are capitalising on the perceived credibility and objectivity of third-party awards using these 'honours' as a promotional strategy to justify their continuing role in society and enhance their perceived legitimacy in relation to claims of ethical and responsible behaviour.

We aimed to develop new warning messages and images to discourage e-cigarette use. METHODS: Participants were 1629 US adults who vaped or smoked. We randomised each participant to evaluate 7 of 28 messages on newly developed warning themes (metals exposure, DNA mutation, cardiovascular problems, chemical exposure, lung damage, impaired immunity, addiction), and the current FDA-required warning (total of 8 messages). Then, participants evaluated images of hazards (eg, metal), internal harms (eg, organ damage) or people experiencing harms. RESULTS: Regarding intended effects, new warning themes all discouraged vaping more than the current FDA-required warning (all p<0.001), led to greater negative affect (all p<0.001) and led to more anticipated social interactions (all p<0.001). The most discouraging warnings were about toxic metals exposure. Regarding unintended effects, the new themes led to more stigma against people who vape (6 of 7 themes, p<0.001) and led to a greater likelihood of thinking vaping is more harmful than smoking (all 7 themes, p<0.001), although unintended effects were smaller than intended effects. Images of harms (internal or people experiencing) discouraged vaping more than images of hazards (all p<0.001).

Focusing on the first retail test market, this study characterised VLN advertising, product placement, discounts and price. METHODS: All Chicago-area Circle K stores (n=133) were telephoned to assess whether they sold VLN. Single-pack price of non-menthol was obtained in 57 of 100 stores that sold VLN. In fall 2022, trained data collectors visited those 57 stores to assess VLN product placement, advertising, discounts and prices. Paired t-tests compared observed VLN price with telephone price and to price of other cigarette brands. RESULTS: Nearly all stores (91.1%) displayed exterior advertisements for VLN, and 41.1% displayed interior advertising, with 8.9% of stores advertising VLN in the power wall but never in the header row. VLN cigarettes were displayed in the power wall exclusively and among high-nicotine cigarettes. Some VLN marketing claims were not FDA-authorised. VLN advertised a sweepstakes offer and rewards programme. Most stores (85.7%) offered VLN discounts. VLN was priced like a premium brand (mean=$10.90, SD=$1.53), and prices obtained by telephone did not differ from observed prices several months later. CONCLUSIONS: Retail marketing strategies for VLN mimic those for high-nicotine cigarettes. Deviations from FDA-authorised marketing claims were evident. Surveillance in future test markets is recommended to assess compliance with marketing claims and examine relative price and discount offers. Of interest is how premium-priced, low-nicotine cigarettes stand to compete in a market dominated by cheaper high-nicotine cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

E-cigarette website marketing is lightly regulated, and little is known about promotional strategies used on e-cigarette companies' websites. This study conducted a content analysis of website marketing from leading e-cigarette companies selling products in California. METHODS: This study identified 20 e-cigarette vendors and 6 e-cigarette brands that had products available for purchase online in California. Two coders visited 26 websites between 06 February 2022 and 17 April 2022. Websites were coded for marketing themes, promotional and interactive content, availability of flavoured e-cigarette products, presence of health warnings, and reference to tobacco control policies. RESULTS: Marketing themes related to physical health benefits of e-cigarette use were found on 50.0% of the websites. 57.7% of the websites had sales/discounts/coupons. 65.4% of the websites had fruit-flavoured disposable e-cigarettes, while 73.1% of the websites had fruit-flavoured e-liquids available for purchase. 69.2% of the websites allowed users to sign up for email newsletters, and 88.9% of such websites did not require users to create an age-verified account to receive email newsletters. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study can be used to inform statewide regulations of promotional communications found on e-cigarette companies' websites and encourage enforcement of age-verification procedures. This may help reduce susceptibility to use, or continued use of, e-cigarette products among price-sensitive populations, such as adolescents and young adults.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODOLOGY: We used NielsenIQ retail scanner data from January 2017 to September 2022 to examine changes over time for average product volume capacity in millilitres, nicotine strength (%) and both sales-weighted average price per disposable unit and per millilitre of e-liquid for each 4-week period. RESULTS: Among disposable e-cigarettes sold between January 2017 and September 2022, average volume capacity increased 518% from 1.1 mL to 5.7 mL and average nicotine strength increased 294% from 1.7% to 5%. Sales-weighted average price per disposable unit and millilitres of e-liquid both remained relatively constant until January 2020. From January 2020 through September 2022, average unit prices increased 165.7% from US$8.49 to US$14.07, while the average price of 1 mL of e-liquid decreased 69.2% from US$7.96 to US$2.45. CONCLUSIONS: The current regulatory regime around e-cigarettes has resulted in disposable e-cigarette manufacturers providing consumers with bigger, cheaper disposable e-cigarettes that come in increasingly higher nicotine strengths. Tobacco policy recommendations such as restricting e-liquid capacity and minimum price laws as well as regulations on product characteristics that affect nicotine emissions and delivery such as nicotine strength, nicotine output, device power, and puff duration should be considered in regulating the e-cigarette market.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Restrictions on sales of flavoured tobacco products have either been implemented or proposed by several US states and localities. Zyn, the most popular ONP brand, is marketing Zyn Chill and Zyn Smooth as 'Flavour-Ban Approved' or 'unflavoured', probably to evade flavour bans and increase product appeal. At present, it is unclear whether these ONPs are indeed free of flavour additives that can impart pleasant sensations such as cooling. METHODS: Sensory cooling and irritant activities of 'Flavour-Ban Approved' Zyn ONPs, Chill and Smooth, along with minty varieties (Cool Mint, Peppermint, Spearmint, Menthol), were analysed by Ca2+ microfluorimetry in HEK293 cells expressing the cold/menthol (TRPM8) or menthol/irritant receptor (TRPA1). Flavour chemical content of these ONPs was analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Zyn Chill ONP extracts robustly activated TRPM8, with much higher efficacy (39%-53%) than the mint-flavoured ONPs. In contrast, mint-flavoured ONP extracts elicited stronger TRPA1 irritant receptor responses than Chill extracts. Chemical analysis demonstrated that Chill exclusively contained WS-3, an odourless synthetic cooling agent, while mint-flavoured ONPs contained WS-3 together with mint flavourants. CONCLUSIONS: ONP products marketed as 'Flavour-Ban Approved' or 'unflavoured' contain flavouring agents, proving that the manufacturer's advertising is misleading. Synthetic coolants such as WS-3 can provide a robust cooling sensation with reduced sensory irritancy, thereby increasing product appeal and use. Regulators need to develop effective strategies for the control of odourless sensory additives used by the industry to bypass flavour bans.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study aims to map the distribution and density of vape stores and their proximity to schools and cafes as well as assess selling of e-cigarettes to youth under 18 years in Denpasar, Bali. METHODS: Using QGIS V.3.18.1 software, we conducted a geographic mapping of all vape stores followed by a survey of the retailers (n=107). Data were collected in April 2022. Several measures explored included retailers' density based on the size and population of subdistricts, retailers' proximity to school. Retailers were asked about selling to youth under 18 years, then its association with distance to schools and other variables were explored. RESULTS: We mapped 122 vape stores across Denpasar city with a density of 1.56 per km2 of the occupied land for housing, 0.16 stores per 1000 total population and 1.06 stores per 1000 youth population. More than a quarter of the schools (28.3%) and the universities (25.6%) had at least one vape store in 250 m radius, while 97.2% of the stores were within 500 m of a café. Of the 107 vape store retailers interviewed, almost half (43.9%) reported selling vapes to youth under 18 years. CONCLUSIONS: Retail availability of e-cigarettes will contribute to the increasing use of this product, especially without a minimum legal sales age. The government should urgently prohibit selling to youth, regulate e-cigarette advertising, promotion and sponsorship and prohibit e-cigarette use where conventional smoking is prohibited.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Though previous literature has documented that cigarette taxes are overly shifted to prices, there is limited evidence on how cigarette tax pass-through to prices is affected by the uptake and evolution of e-cigarettes (ECs) in the US market. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates how cigarette excise tax pass-through rate varied by price levels (the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile prices) and the uptake and evolution of ECs. METHODS: Tax pass-through rates were assessed using ordinary least squares regressions while controlling for state, year and month fixed effects. Different trends were then tested for the pre-EC uptake era (2006-2011), EC uptake era (2012-2016) and the evolution of nicotine salt-based ECs era (2017 and later). FINDINGS: Cigarette excise taxes were fully shifted to the 25th and 50th percentile prices and overly shifted to the 75th percentile prices at a 1:1.1 rate. While cigarette excise taxes had a continuous impact on raising prices, the tax pass-through rates were lower for lower priced cigarettes, and states imposed lower taxes. CONCLUSIONS: Continuing to raise cigarette taxes may be needed to create financial incentives to encourage people who smoke to switch to ECs. In addition, continuing to raise cigarette taxes and additional pricing policies such as price promotion restrictions are needed to increase retail prices and reduce price minimisation opportunities.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study examined support for very low nicotine cigarettes (VLNCs) in Australia, Canada, England and the USA between 2016 and 2020. METHODS: Repeated cross-sectional data were analysed from participants who currently smoke, formerly smoked or vaped and/or currently vape in the 2016 (n=11 150) and/or 2020 (n=5432) International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey. Respondents were asked if they would support a law that reduces the amount of nicotine in cigarettes to make them less addictive. Adjusted and weighted logistic regression analyses estimated the prevalence and predictors of support, such as country, age, sex, education, income, race and smoking/vaping status for VLNCs (support vs oppose/do not know). RESULTS: A majority of respondents supported a VLNC law, with support highest in Canada (69%; 2016 and 2020 combined), followed by England (61%), Australia (60%) and the USA (58%). Overall, support decreased from 62% in 2016 to 59% in 2020 (p=0.004), which did not differ by country. Levels of support differed by smoking/vaping status, where those who exclusively smoked daily showed the lowest level of support (59%) and those who exclusively vaped non-daily had the highest level of support (72%). CONCLUSION: More than half of respondents in all four countries-including those who smoked daily-supported a hypothetical VLNC standard to render cigarettes less addictive. It is important to examine if support is sustained after policies are implemented.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: We analysed data collected from adults who smoked factory-made and/or roll-your-own (RYO) cigarettes in nine waves (2007-2020) of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project Australia Survey (nsample=5452, nobservations=11 534). The main outcome measures were type of tobacco products purchased: RYO, carton, pack or pouch size and brand segment. Logistic regression, fit using generalised estimating equations, was estimated the association between the outcome and participant characteristics. RESULTS: The reported price-minimising purchasing patterns increased from 2007 to 2020: any RYO (23.8-43.9%), large-sized pack (2007: 24.0% to 2016: 34.3%); shifting from large-sized to small-sized packs (2020: 37.7%), and economy brand (2007: 37.2% to 2020: 59.3%); shifting from large (2007: 55.8%) to small economy packs (2014: 15.3% to 2020: 48.1%). Individuals with a lower income, a higher nicotine dependence level and no quit intention were more likely to purchase RYO and large-sized packs. CONCLUSION: RYO, large-sized packs and products with a low upfront cost (eg, small RYO pouches and small-sized economy brand packs) may appeal to people on low incomes. Australia's diverse tobacco pack and pouch sizes allow the tobacco industry to influence tobacco purchases. Standardising pack and pouch sizes may reduce some price-related marketing and especially benefit people who have a low income, are highly addicted and have no quit intention.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We examined youth e-cigarette prevalence by TAPS regulations in countries with different income levels. METHODS: We analysed data on 165 299 respondents from 48 countries with 2016/2018 WHO FCTC implementation reports and 2016-2019 Global Youth Tobacco Survey. We used multilevel logistic regressions to examine associations between TAPS regulations and current e-cigarette use, stratified by country income. RESULTS: About 1 in 10 respondents was currently using e-cigarettes. Respondents in countries with TAPS bans on the internet were less likely to use e-cigarettes (adjOR=0.58; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.86) than youth in countries without such bans. In lower middle-income and low-income countries, bans on displaying tobacco products at the point of sale (adjOR=0.55; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.90), bans on product placement (adjOR=0.44; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.69) and strength of additional TAPS measures were associated with lower prevalence of e-cigarette use among students. Being taught about the dangers of the use of tobacco in school was associated with lower odds of e-cigarette use. No differences in the use of e-cigarettes were observed by types of TAPS among respondents in high-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: Strengthening implementation of TAPS policies and assuring they cover new and emerging products, online channels and points of sales are essential, especially in lower income countries. Maintaining tobacco health education is also important to protect youth from e-cigarette use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

While Australia has been a pioneer in tobacco control, Australian Governments are yet to commit to endgame policies. The media play an important role reflecting and influencing public opinion and policymaker positions, and can help set the agenda for policy innovation. METHOD: Media articles mentioning tobacco endgame goals and policies published between 2000 and 2021 were identified by searching Factiva and Google (News). We used reflexive thematic analysis (RTA) to identify themes in the articles, supported by content analysis, to describe elements of the data and sentiment analysis to categorise the article sentiment. A deductive-inductive approach was applied in the RTA, coding text from the articles against predefined codes, while also generating new codes where novel themes were identified. Codes were then grouped and summarised. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-three articles were included for analysis. The media discourse focused on three policies: tobacco-free generation; banning or phasing out retail supply of tobacco; and mandating a very low nicotine content standard for cigarettes. A broad range of themes in the articles supported endgame policies, including the large health toll from tobacco, government responsibility to act and the total social costs far outweighing any economic benefit from the tobacco market. Opposing themes included the purported failures of 'prohibition', illicit trade, 'nanny statism' and impact on retail trade. Equity themes were scarce. The benefits of a smoke-free society were described at a societal level, rather than the personal benefits for individuals. CONCLUSION: Media articles on the tobacco endgame in Australia generally contained positive sentiment about endgame policies. When engaging with the media, endgame advocates should be aware of, and ready to counter, opposing themes such as the purported failures of 'prohibition', 'nanny state' rhetoric or a growth in illicit tobacco trade.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Additionally, e-cigarette nicotine can be either 'synthetic' or 'tobacco-derived'. These dimensions of nicotine have implications for nicotine absorption, bioavailability and sensory experiences. However, it is unclear if the young people using e-cigarettes are aware of these nicotine dimensions. METHODS: Data came from a cohort of Ohio youth (aged 15-24) who reported using an e-cigarette in the past 4 months (N=271). Participants were enrolled and provided background information in 2021; their 12-month follow-up survey asked about the presence, form and type of nicotine in their usual e-cigarette. Individuals who reported that they could distinguish between tobacco-derived and synthetic nicotine were additionally asked to describe the difference. RESULTS: Of the 247 youth who reported that there was nicotine in their usual e-cigarette, 71.7% did not know whether it was free-base or nicotine salt and 75.7% did not know whether it was synthetic or tobacco-derived. Awareness was higher among youth who were using e-cigarettes at a greater frequency and quantity. The majority reported that they could not detect a difference between the experience of using synthetic vs tobacco-derived nicotine. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the generally limited awareness about nicotine among youth who used e-cigarettes. Improvements in health communications and requirements for e-cigarette industry disclosures are necessary to ensure that consumers are better informed about the dimensions-and the risks-of the nicotine they are consuming.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

California's implementation of a statewide flavour restriction (Senate Bill 793 (SB-793)) in December 2022 enforced through its tobacco retailer licensing programme presented an opportunity to assess whether the exclusion of e-commerce in the definition of 'tobacco retailer' might have resulted in a shift in consumer behaviour towards e-commerce. METHODS: To examine the association between SB-793 implementation and online shopping for tobacco, we collected weekly Google search rates related to online shopping for cigarettes and vaping products in California from January 2018 to May 2023. We compared observed rates of shopping queries after SB-793 implementation to counterfactual expected rates and prediction intervals (PI) calculated from autoregressive iterative moving average models fit to historical trends. Content analysis was performed on the search results to identify websites marketing flavoured vaping products and menthol cigarettes. RESULTS: The week SB-793 was implemented, shopping queries were 194.4% (95% PI 100.8% to 451.5%) and 161.7% (95% PI 81.7% to 367.5%) higher than expected for cigarettes and vapes, respectively. Cigarette shopping queries remained elevated significantly for 11 weeks and vape shopping queries for 6 weeks. All search results contained links to websites that offered flavoured vaping products or menthol cigarettes to Californian consumers. DISCUSSION: These findings raise concerns about potential loopholes in policy enforcement created by the absence of explicit regulations on e-commerce sales in retailer licensing programmes. Strengthening regulations to include e-commerce and monitoring e-commerce compliance are recommended to enhance the impact of laws enforced through retailer licensing programmes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study examines the acceptability of ENDS by liquid nicotine concentration and flavour among people who smoke using ENDS to reduce their smoking. METHODS: People who smoke cigarettes but were naïve to ENDS participated in a double-blind randomised controlled trial to reduce conventional cigarette smoking. Participants were randomised to either a control cigarette substitute (CS) or one of three ENDS groups; 0 mg/mL, 8 mg/mL or 36 mg/mL nicotine concentration. ENDS flavour was chosen by the participant (tobacco or menthol). Participants reported their CS, ENDS and cigarettes per day (CPD) from the past 7 days at 1-month, 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits. Participants also reported side effects and measures of satisfaction, psychological reward, aversion and craving relief. Outcome variables were modelled using linear mixed effects by the following groups: liquid nicotine concentration, flavour and a flavour-nicotine concentration interaction. RESULTS: Participants (n=520) were 41.2% male, 67.3% white, had a mean age of 46.2 years and smoked a mean of 18.6 CPD (SD=7.74) at baseline. All flavour and concentration groups decreased CPD from baseline to all follow-up visits with the 36 mg/mL experiencing the greatest reduction, compared with the 0 mg/mL and 8 mg/mL groups. All groups except the 36 mg/mL group decreased their product use over time. The use of menthol flavour was associated with fewer side effects at 3 months (p=0.02) and lesser aversion at 1 month (p=0.03) compared with tobacco-flavoured ENDS. The 36 mg/mL group experienced the greatest craving relief and greatest aversion compared with other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both nicotine concentration and flavour appear to have independent, as well as interactive, effects that influence ENDS acceptability among people who use cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

RESULTS: Of the 217 active branded posts that mentioned or depicted tobacco/nicotine products, most promoted rather than countered the sale of such products (84.3% vs 15.7%, respectively). Posts originating from US Instagram users accounted for 42.6% of promotional content. After the USA, posts from Indonesia (19.1%), Pakistan (9.8%) and India (8.2%) were most frequent. Most posts were fully in English (74.9%). Posts featured hookah (39.4%), electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) accessories (17.5%), ENDS devices and e-liquids (16.9%) and various types of cigars (15.3%). The majority of US posts promoted venues or events where tobacco/nicotine products were featured (71.8%). Almost half of all promotional posts (47.0%) were sponsored by tobacco industry accounts. Posts that encouraged cessation were primarily (47.1%) sponsored by non-government organisations. CONCLUSION: Despite attempts at self-regulation, paid partnership posts promoting tobacco and nicotine products are present on Instagram, especially posts promoting venues and events that feature tobacco and nicotine use. Self-regulation of this content shows limited success, suggesting a need for federal oversight and additional counter-marketing in social media settings.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study explored the perceptions of, and responses by, young adults who use e-cigarettes to the flavour ban. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 Chinese young adults aged 18-25 years who had used e-cigarettes daily in the past 3 months. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the interview data. FINDINGS: Four themes were identified from the data: (1) understanding of the public health benefits, (2) resistance to and misperceptions of the flavour ban, (3) circumvention of the flavour ban and (4) acceptance of the flavour ban. Some participants expressed support for the ban due to perceived public health benefits, while others who resisted the ban emphasised their right to choose preferred flavours and questioned the rationale behind the policy. Participants responded to the flavour ban by utilising a variety of adaptive strategies, including purchasing flavoured e-cigarettes through illegal channels or exploring alternative ways to obtain flavours. Those who complied with the ban responded with different strategies, including switching back to combustible cigarettes, using tobacco-flavoured e-cigarettes, or quitting vaping. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest the need for comprehensive regulatory measures, including stringent enforcement measures, transparent health communication and vigilant monitoring of e-cigarette manufacturers' tactics, to reduce e-cigarette use among young adults.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

British American Tobacco New Zealand and Imperial Brands Australasia tried to undermine this policy via the 'Save Our Stores' (SOS) campaign, which purportedly represented small convenience store owners' interests. METHODS: We used the Policy Dystopia Model as a framework to review discursive and instrumental strategies employed in the SOS campaign. Specifically, we critically analysed the arguments, narratives and frames employed in the campaign. RESULTS: Most SOS arguments drew on discursive strategies that emphasised unanticipated costs to the economy and society, and presented a near-apocalyptic future. Adverse outcomes included economic mayhem, thriving illicit trade, increased violent crime, fewer police, and heavier individual tax burdens. The campaign framed the government as an authoritarian legislator with misplaced priorities and used disinformation to bolster these claims. We identified a new normalisation narrative used to present very low nicotine cigarettes (VLNCs) as experimental and, by implication, risky. A metanarrative of lawlessness and decreased public safety connected the different claims. CONCLUSION: To address the existential challenges they face, tobacco companies used several discursive strategies to oppose the retailer reduction and VLNC policies. Our findings could inform counterarguments, and help international policymakers and advocates anticipate opposition they may encounter when introducing endgame measures, such as reducing tobacco availability.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, the popularity of newer products, such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), has complicated emissions testing because the products' mouth-end geometries do not readily seal with existing smoking and vaping machines. The demand for emissions data on popularly used products has led to inefficient and non-standardised solutions, such as laboratories making their geometry-specific custom adaptors and/or employing flexible tubing, for each unique mouth-end geometry tested. A user-friendly, validated, universal smoking machine adaptor (USMA) is needed for testing the variety of tobacco products reflecting consumer use, including e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products, cigarettes, plastic-tipped cigarillos and cigars. METHODS: A prototype USMA that is compatible with existing smoking/vaping machines was designed and fabricated. The quality of the seal between the USMA and different tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, cigars and cigarillos, was evaluated by examining the leak rate. RESULTS: Unlike commercial, product-specific adaptors, the USMA seals well with a wide range of tobacco product mouth-end geometries and masses. This includes e-cigarettes with non-cylindrical mouth ends and cigarillos with cuboid-like plastic tips. USMA leak rates were lower than or equivalent to commercial, product-specific adaptors. CONCLUSION: This report provides initial evidence that the USMA seals reliably with a variety of tobacco product mouth-end geometries and can be used with existing linear smoking/vaping machines to potentially improve the precision, repeatability and reproducibility of machine smoke yield data. Accurate and reproducible emissions testing is critical for regulating tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: Using the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, we applied a multistate transition model to 28 061 adults in waves 4-5 (2017-2019) and 24 584 adults in waves 5-6 (2019-2021), estimating transition rates for initiation, cessation and switching products for each period overall and by age group. RESULTS: Cigarette initiation among adults who never used either product decreased from 2017-2019 to 2019-2021, but ENDS initiation did not significantly change. The persistence of ENDS-only use remained high (75%-80% after 1 year). Cigarette-only use transitions remained similar (88% remaining, 7% to non-current use and 5% to dual or ENDS-only use). In contrast, dual use to ENDS-only transitions increased from 9.5% (95% CI 7.3% to 11.7%) to 20.0% (95% CI 17.4% to 22.6%) per year, decreasing the persistence of dual use. The dual to cigarette-only use transition remained at about 25%. These changes were qualitatively similar across adult age groups, though adults ages 18-24 years exhibited the highest probability of switching from cigarette-only use to dual use and from dual use to ENDS-only use. CONCLUSIONS: The persistence of ENDS use among adults remained high in 2019-2021, but a larger fraction of dual users transitioned to ENDS-only use compared with 2017-2019. Because the fraction of cigarette-only users switching to dual use remained low, especially among older adults, the public health implications of this change are minimal.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Regulators intent on maximising ENDS' public health benefit and minimising harm may be interested in regulating the nicotine dose delivered by ENDS in a single puff. The per-puff nicotine dose is the product of ENDS nicotine emission rate (or 'nicotine flux') and the duration of the puff taken by the person using the ENDS (or 'puff duration'). Nicotine flux can be measured or predicted mathematically for any ENDS device/liquid combination. Puff duration can be controlled electronically, as demonstrated by several ENDS marketed today. Combining nicotine flux and puff duration regulation is feasible today and provides authorities the means to limit nicotine dose per puff to a level that may help people who smoke quit smoking while reducing the possibility that nicotine-naive individuals will engage in repeated ENDS use. Tobacco regulatory science and product regulation will both be improved by a rigorous approach to understanding, characterising, and reporting the nicotine dose emitted by ENDS.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

However, studies of awareness of tobacco industry tactics among public health players and policymakers in low-income and middle-income countries are limited. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of individuals who had been involved in tobacco control in Thailand. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between awareness of tobacco industry tactics and different attitudes towards tobacco industry and perceptions towards e-cigarettes, controlling for role in tobacco control and demographics among 441 respondents. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 11.3% had never heard of any tobacco industry tactics, whereas 11.1% had heard of all tactics asked in the survey. Tobacco industry tactics which were less known by participants were intimidation (30.6%) and illicit trade (37.4%). Participants who were more aware of tobacco industry tactics were more likely to have negative attitudes towards the tobacco industry and e-cigarettes. Compared with active experts of the Provincial Tobacco Products Control Committee and provincial public health officials who work in tobacco control programmes, advocates who worked for civil society organisations in tobacco control were more aware of tobacco industry tactics and had less favourable perceptions of e-cigarettes. CONCLUSION: This study emphasises the importance of educating public health professionals and policymakers about tobacco industry behaviour, especially in the era of e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study compared POS marketing strategies for IQOS (and HEETS tobacco sticks) before and after Israel implemented a display ban and plain packaging. METHODS: Audits of stores selling IQOS (n=87) in four Israeli cities were conducted, 16-20 months post display ban and plain packaging introduction, including previously audited stores (n=60) (prior to the implementation of these measures). Descriptive analyses and matched pre-post comparisons were conducted to assess regulatory compliance and marketing strategies over time. RESULTS: Almost all stores (90.8%) were non-compliant with the display ban; but most were compliant with plain packaging (81.6%) and advertisement ban (83.5%) regulations. Following the display ban, there was a significant increase in the number of IQOS/HEETS internal advertisements (21.7% vs 41.7%, p=0.023). These were mostly compliant with the advertisement ban (ie, did not mention the brand name explicitly), and appeared in the form of generic signs or flags and/or special displays. The percentage of stores featuring the IQOS device increased (1.7% to 20.0%, p=0.003), as did the percentage carrying at least four HEETS flavours (36.7% to 63.3%, p=0.006). CONCLUSION: This sample of Israeli stores selling IQOS showed low compliance with the display ban. The increase in signs/special displays, mostly compliant with the advertisement ban, could serve as purchase cues circumventing the intent of the legislation.

In four high-income countries, we examined whether people who smoke would support a total ban on smoked tobacco products under two differing policy scenarios. METHODS: Data were from 14 363 adults (≥18) who smoked cigarettes (≥monthly) and participated in at least one of the 2018, 2020 or 2022 International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping Surveys in Australia, Canada, England and the USA. In 2018, respondents were asked whether they would support a law that totally bans smoked tobacco if the government provides smoking cessation assistance (Cessation Assistance scenario). In 2020 and 2022, respondents were asked a slightly different question as to whether they would support a law that totally bans smoked tobacco if the government encourages people who smoke to use alternative nicotine products like vaping products and nicotine replacement products instead (substitution scenario). Responses (support vs oppose/don't know) were estimated on weighted data. RESULTS: Support was greater for the cessation assistance scenario (2018, 36.6%) than the nicotine substitution scenario (2020, 26.9%; 2022, 26.3%, both p<0.0001). In the longitudinal analysis, there was a significant scenario by country interaction effect with lower support in Canada, the USA and Australia under the substitution scenario than in the cessation scenario, but equivalent levels in England under both scenarios. The strongest correlates of support under both scenarios were planning to quit smoking within 6 months, wanting to quit smoking 'a lot' and recent use of nicotine replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Opposition to banning smoked tobacco predominates among people who smoke, but less with a cessation assistance scenario than one encouraging nicotine substitution. Wanting to quit a lot was the strongest indicator of support.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

In April 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) obtained regulatory authority over non-tobacco nicotine products, which include many ONPs. Advertising practices for ONPs need monitoring to understand marketing strategies and inform FDA marketing authorisation decisions. METHODS: ONP advertisement (ad) expenditure data (January 2016-June 2023) were purchased (print, TV, radio, online video, online display and mobile; N=125 236) and adjusted to 2023 dollars. Descriptive statistics examined expenditures by ONP brand and media outlet over time. RESULTS: Velo spent the most on ONP advertising (89.8%), followed by Zyn (5.7%) and Black Buffalo (1.2%). Velo encompassed the majority of TV (98.1%), radio (99.9%) and mobile ad spend (87.3%); Zyn was the leader for online display (46.2%) and online video (71.1%); and Black Buffalo accounted for 100% of print ads. In 2023, (January-June), Zyn accounted for 88.0% of ad expenditures and Velo spent $0, though the total amount spent by Zyn was far less than Velo in prior years. TV ads (98.1% Velo) aired primarily on prime time/late night or 09:00-17:00 on weekends. Radio ads (99.9% Velo) aired primarily from 06:00 to 10:00, 12:00 to 14:00 and 15:00 to 19:00 on weekdays. Overall, expenditures focused on reaching a national audience, though print ads indicated potential male-targeted marketing. CONCLUSIONS: Following FDA's regulatory authority over non-tobacco nicotine products, ad expenditures for Velo dropped to $0. Ongoing surveillance of ONP ad trends can inform FDA marketing authorisation decisions by revealing brand-specific marketing strategies that may be targeted toward populations at increased risk of tobacco use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

DESIGN: Repeat cross-sectional population-based survey weighted to match the population of Great Britain. SETTING: The survey was conducted in England, Scotland and Wales in September 2021, October 2022 and October 2023. PARTICIPANTS: 6541 adults living in Great Britain. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Support for each policy and year and prevalence ratios (PRs) comparing support between years and subgroups. RESULTS: The most popular policy each year was restricting e-cigarette advertising (74%/79%/85%), followed by raising the sales age to 21 years (50%/58%/64%), providing prescription e-cigarettes (45%/44%/47%) and Smokefree Generation (34%/44%/49%). The largest increases were for policies about the age of sale (Smokefree Generation: 2021/2022 PR=1.28, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.40, 2022/2023 PR=1.12, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.20; raising the age to 21 years: 2021/2022 PR=1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.23, 2022/2023 PR=1.11, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.17). Only 30% opposed Smokefree Generation in 2023 down from 41% in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Support for each policy increased each year, except for providing prescription e-cigarettes. Restricting e-cigarette advertising was the most popular policy, while support for age of sale policies, in particular for a Smokefree Generation, grew most.

In the Joint Action on Tobacco Control 2 (JATC-2) -project, we examined adopted and planned endgame goals and measures as well as preparedness to counter tobacco industry interference in the process. We surveyed key informants in 24 out of 50 countries in the WHO European Region (19 of the 27 EU Member States, MS). Altogether, eight countries (7 EU MS) had official governmental endgame goals, and an additional six EU MS had similar proposals from government, civil society or research entities. Movement towards tobacco endgame was most evident in retail-oriented and consumer-oriented policies. These include restricting the sales of tobacco and related products and raising the age limit above 18 years. Product standards were used especially to regulate flavours but no measures to substantially reduce addictiveness were reported. Market-oriented measures that tap into industry profits were predominantly missing, and countries often lacked concrete tools to prevent industry interference. Respondents' concerns around tobacco endgame were related to high smoking prevalence in some population groups, non-combustible and new nicotine products, cross-border marketing, political will, challenges with the existing regulations and industry interference. Results indicate both momentum and challenges in adopting and disseminating measures that facilitate achieving tobacco endgame goals. The EU goal can be used to advocate for national endgame goals and measures, and for the strengthened implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Researchers continue to conduct studies to understand the health risks and benefits of e-cigarettes to inform health education and promotion efforts as well as public policy. Studies funded by the tobacco industry examining the potential risks and benefits of e-cigarettes have also been conducted and are sometimes published in the scientific literature. Frequently, tobacco and e-cigarette industry-funded researchers report findings that contradict research funded by other sources. While many industry-funded studies may appear methodologically sound at first glance, in some cases, industry-funded studies include methodological flaws that result in misleading conclusions. The tobacco industry's use of biased research to influence tobacco-related policy decisions in the past is well-documented. This commentary provides specific examples of recent e-cigarette research funded by the tobacco/e-cigarette industry in which methodological flaws result in misleading conclusions that support industry goals. Given the long history of biased research conducted by the tobacco industry, there is a need to assess whether research funded by the e-cigarette industry similarly contains methodological flaws. We emphasise the need for tobacco and e-cigarette-funded research to be scrutinised by non-industry-funded subject matter experts and call for journals to not consider manuscripts that have received support from the tobacco or e-cigarette industry.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

An important technology in tobacco product design is the use of additives including those that create characterising flavours, that is, flavours that are perceived by taste and or smell by the user. To curb youth use, many countries are implementing policies to limit the use of flavours and other additives in tobacco products. This paper reviews the global landscape of tobacco additives policies including those focusing only on flavouring additives, updating a previous review. METHODS: We gathered additives policy data from available online sources of tobacco control policies including parties' reports to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (where WHO refers to World Health Organization), the website Tobacco Control Laws, government websites, searches with the Google search engine and consultations with the WHO to ensure comprehensiveness of the assessment. The policies were classified according to their objective and characteristics: Labelling regulations, sales bans and tobacco product design regulations. We classified and organised the regulations according to their stated intent. RESULTS: We found that 62 countries had tobacco products' additives-related regulations at the regional, national or subnational levels. Most of these regulations focused on flavouring additives especially bans on the selling, importing and manufacturing tobacco products with characterising flavours. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate various global policies addressing additives and/or flavours and a range of definitions of additives and flavours. Establishing common definitions and standards could facilitate cooperation between countries and regions.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The proposed changes in the regulation include a full ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (TAPS), increasing health warning label (HWL) size and regulating electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). This study analysed the arguments and actors for and against the PP 109/2012 amendment in online media articles. METHOD: Content analysis of 326 online articles reporting on the PP 109/2012 amendment published from 2018 to 2023, retrieved from the Tobacco Watcher platform. We coded articles for statements supporting or opposing the amendment (position statement), content of the arguments used to support (supporting argument) and oppose (opposing argument) the amendment, actors presenting the arguments and tobacco control measures. We iteratively reviewed and coded data and presented the frequency of categories. RESULTS: Of 332 position statements, 53.3% were against the amendment. The main categories of supporting arguments (N=1448) included smoking trends (21.1%), health implications (16.6%), science-based evidence (9.6%) and protecting the population (9.2%). Opposing arguments (N=1413) emphasised the tobacco farmers' welfare (16.6%), impact on the industry (16.4%) and current regulation is sufficient (11.0%). Supporting actors were predominantly health-related entities and government officials (89.3%), while 62.1% of opposing actors included trade and Islamic groups, the tobacco industry and front groups. HWLs, e-cigarette/heated tobacco product regulation and TAPS were the main (77.8%) tobacco control measures mentioned in the proamendment arguments, while HWLs, TAPS and cigarette sale restrictions were the dominant (79.3%) tobacco control measures in anti-amendment arguments. CONCLUSION: Indonesia's tobacco control reform faced opposition by false claims primarily from industry allies, resulting in a 5-year delay in enactment. Future tobacco control media advocacy must address these claims and emphasise the alignment of economic interests with public health goals.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This experimental study explored whether attitudes towards e-cigarettes and susceptibility to use are influenced by the names used by the industry to describe and market these products. METHOD: An accredited web panel provider recruited a sample of 383 Australians aged 12-29 years who had never smoked to participate in an online survey that featured an embedded experiment. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three conditions, each of which used a different name to describe e-cigarettes (condition 1: 'e-cigarettes', condition 2: 'vapes'; condition 3: either 'IGETS', 'Puff Bars', 'HQD Cuvies' or 'Gunnpods'). The survey assessed respondents' overall opinion of the product described; attitudes towards the product; liking of the product; and curiosity, willingness and intentions to use the product. RESULTS: Those in the 'brand name' condition scored higher than those in the 'e-cigarettes' condition on all dependent variables. Those in the 'vapes' condition scored higher than those in the 'e-cigarettes' condition on product attitude. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that the use of brand names and terms such as 'vapes' instead of 'e-cigarettes' results in more favourable attitudes towards e-cigarettes and susceptibility to use among young Australians. Results highlight the problematic influence of promotional language use favoured by industry.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

DATA SOURCES: Following Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, relevant studies published in English since 2003 were identified via searches of eight databases in March and August 2023. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently completed screening procedures. Eligible studies were from Australia and described associations between tobacco or vape retailer density/proximity and adult or youth smoking/vaping prevalence or behaviours, neighbourhood socioeconomic status, geographic location, school locations and/or Indigenous status. DATA EXTRACTION: Results are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 794 publications screened, 12 studies from 6 Australian states were included. Six studies from five states reported statistically significant associations between neighbourhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage and tobacco retailer density, yet only two studies from two states found a significant relationship between retailer density and adult smoking prevalence. Increasing retailer density was consistently significantly associated with increasing geographical remoteness in three states. No studies explored associations with tobacco retailer proximity or vape retailer density/proximity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a moderate number of studies overall, state-level evidence is limited, and unknown for Australian territories. Evidence from five Australian states reflects the international evidence that increasing retailer density is significantly associated with increasing socioeconomic disadvantage and remoteness, supporting the need for tobacco supply-based policies. Further research is required to understand the impact of retailer density and adult and youth smoking prevalence in Australia.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Drafted and presented to the parliament, the Malaysian Control of Smoking Products for Public Health Bill 2022 highlighted the Generational Endgame (GEG) policy, which forbids the use and sale of tobacco products and smoking substances to individuals born on or after 1 January 2007. Stakeholders, including government and non-governmental organisations, policymakers, healthcare professionals, tobacco industry representatives and retailers, have expressed differing opinions indicating non-support of the policy. The Attorney General Chamber deemed the policy as 'unconstitutional' for discriminating against those within the implementation age range, which prompted its omission from the revised Control of Smoking Products for Public Health 2023 Bill. This paper discusses the obstacles and possible implications of the GEG policy implementation in Malaysia and details its implementation in other countries. This paper also proposes several recommendations for future directions in tackling the obstacles mentioned more effectively.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study assesses how people interpret the now-restricted additive-free claims and newer T&W claims on Natural American Spirit (NAS) and L&M cigarette packs. METHODS: An online between-subjects experiment randomised 2526 US adults to view one of three packs: an NAS additive-free pack, an NAS T&W pack or an L&M T&W pack. Participants provided their interpretations of the claim they viewed in an open-text response box. n=810 responses were coded, with frequency reported overall, by experimental condition, and by product harm perceptions. RESULTS: Interpreting the claim as meaning 'fewer chemicals/harmful ingredients' was significantly more frequent in the NAS additive-free (47.7%) condition but remained common among those in the NAS T&W (27.2%) and L&M T&W (20.3%) conditions (p<0.01). For all conditions, the 'fewer chemicals' interpretation was more common among those who believed the product was less harmful than other cigarettes (p<0.001). Some participants (8%-15%) interpreted the claim they saw to mean the product was less addictive or had less nicotine than other cigarettes, with no significant differences by condition. CONCLUSIONS: Like 'additive-free', 'tobacco and water' marketing claims are commonly interpreted as meaning cigarettes have fewer chemicals or harmful ingredients, suggesting they may similarly function as unauthorised modified exposure claims. Regulatory action and educational interventions are warranted to reduce use of these misleading claims and to correct misperceptions.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Little is known about these emerging products and their contents. METHODS: Moisture, total nicotine and pH content were analysed in 70 commercially available TFN products, covering five different types (lozenges, chewing gum, loose leaf, toothpicks and pouches). The freebase nicotine was calculated using the measured pH values. RESULTS: Total nicotine levels ranged from 0.822 to 31.5 mg/g. Nicotine levels were highest in nicotine pouches (1.41-8.11 mg/product) and lowest in toothpicks (1.19-1.57 mg/product). Nicotine levels in TFN loose leaf (1.26-9.16 mg/g) were comparable to conventional moist snuff. The pH ranged from pH 4.68 to 9.49 and per cent freebase nicotine ranged from 0.0453% to 96.7%. The freebase nicotine content was highest in nicotine pouches (2.15-16.8 mg/g) and lowest in lozenges (0.0004-0.349 mg/g). The majority of TFN products (91.4%) analysed were advertised to contain flavour components. CONCLUSION: Overall, products advertised as higher strength were found to have higher nicotine content than products advertised as lower strength. The measured total nicotine content was either equal to or less than the level stated on the label, except for one product. Although TFN products may not contain tobacco lamina and may lack many harmful chemicals and carcinogens found in conventional smokeless products, freebase nicotine levels in the pouch products are elevated and could contribute to higher levels of addiction and other negative health effects.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

While health warning labels play a critical role in communicating the health risks of tobacco product use to consumers, compliance with US Federal Regulation's nicotine warning requirements on hookah tobacco packaging is low. Some labelling suggests that consumers are exposed to 'only 0.05% nicotine'. Here, this study sought to evaluate the accuracy of nicotine levels advertised on flavoured hookah tobacco packaging. METHODS: We measured nicotine content of commercial hookah tobacco in a total of 15 flavours purchased from five different manufactures, that were selected based on their popularity in the USA and UK markets. Concentrations of nicotine were determined by gas-liquid chromatography with nitrogen phosphorus detection, using 5-methyl nicotine as an internal standard. Nicotine content was expressed as a percentage of tobacco weight. RESULTS: Out of the 15 flavours tested and as compared with nicotine levels advertised on product packaging (0.05% nicotine), 12 (80%) had higher nicotine levels. Of these 12 flavours, actual nicotine levels ranged between 20% and 160% higher (0.08±0.01% vs 0.05%; mean±SE) than advertised levels. Estimates of determined levels of nicotine ranged from 0.05% to 0.13%. CONCLUSION: Nicotine levels cited by leading hookah tobacco manufacturers are misleading. The advertised levels of nicotine do not reflect the quantified dose of nicotine available to consumers of hookah tobacco products. Findings highlight the need for the development of hookah tobacco product regulations and labelling standards, similar to other tobacco products, to avoid misleading vulnerable consumers, including youth and young adults.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study assessed changes in tobacco sales and marketing near schools in ten cities across China from 2021 to 2023. METHODS: We sampled 879 schools (731 urban, 148 rural) using multistage sampling and observed the availability and marketing of tobacco products at retailers within 100 m of urban schools and 250 m of rural schools in 2021 and 2023. McNemar and paired t-tests were conducted with school as unit of analysis. RESULTS: From 2021 to 2023, there was a significant decrease in prevalence of cigarette retailers around both urban schools (57.2% vs 47.1%, p<0.05) and rural schools (70.3% vs 62.8%, p<0.05). The prevalence of flavoured cigarette retailers significantly decreased around urban schools (42.8% vs 38.9%, p<0.05); however, it remained high (52%) around rural schools. The total number of e-cigarette retailers decreased from 59 to 11. Over 90% of cigarette and e-cigarette retailers displayed tobacco products. While the prevalence of retailers displaying cigarettes inside significantly declined around urban schools (55.5% vs 44.6%, p<0.001), the prevalence of retailers displaying cigarettes next to sweets, drinks or snacks significantly increased (28.0% vs 32.1%, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The number of retailers selling and displaying cigarettes and flavoured cigarettes decreased but remained widespread, and the number of retailers selling e-cigarettes also decreased near schools in 10 cities across China. To protect youth, effective enforcement of regulations prohibiting tobacco sales around schools, a comprehensive advertising ban and restrictions on flavoured cigarettes are necessary.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Nicotine pouches may appeal to people who use tobacco, but there is also concern that they may appeal to youth and non-nicotine users. This study analysed nicotine pouch advertising trends from 2021 to 2023 to explore advertising features and inform regulatory strategies. METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of 2147 nicotine pouch print, radio, online/mobile, direct emails and social media ads from 2021 to 2023. Ads were coded for flavours, terms and claims. Two trained coders double-coded all ads, and any discrepancies were reconciled. We conducted χ2 and post-hoc tests to assess changes over time, using Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Most ads (84.6%) were posted on brands' social media accounts. Zyn ads comprised 54.5% of ads across media platforms. Most ads (72.3%) featured flavoured products, particularly fruit (27.1%) and mint (26.1%). Common terms included 'smoke-free' (19.2%), 'tobacco-free' (18.4%), 'synthetic' (12.9%) and 'spit-free' (10.6%), which all significantly declined from 2021 to 2023. The most common claim featured how convenient the product was to use, which significantly increased over time. Claims about product discreetness and the presence of coupons/discounts also significantly increased over time. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a decline in terms of connecting nicotine pouches to other tobacco products and an increase in potentially youth-appealing convenience claims. Future research should investigate how these features impact risk perceptions and use intentions among people who never and currently use tobacco to inform regulations (ie, restrict youth-appealing claims).","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

To provide greater insights into the strategies being used to sway public policy related to electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), we examined the communication practices adopted by those with a direct and indirect stake in these products in their submissions to government consultations. METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of 196 submissions made by ENDS industry actors (eg, manufacturers, retailers, trade associations) to 13 public consultations conducted during a critical period in Australian ENDS legislation (2017-2023). Adapting a framework used in alcohol and tobacco control, we classified communication practices into higher-order categories (eg, misuse of evidence, logical fallacies/flawed arguments). We also coded the specific arguments used in submissions. RESULTS: Almost all submissions featured the misuse of evidence (96%), with the use of unsupported factual assertions (92%) and the promotion of weak evidence (79%) the most common practices identified. Most submissions featured logical fallacies (88%). In terms of the arguments used, almost all submissions featured content denying the effectiveness of ENDS control strategies (95%), with (1) unsubstantiated claims about the adverse effects of ENDS restrictions (85%) and (2) the promotion of alternative regulation that favours vested interests (85%) most common. CONCLUSION: Those with direct and indirect financial interests in ENDS are engaging in misleading communication practices to interfere with public policy. Immediate action is required to limit the influence of these actors on policymaking and protect population health.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

To our knowledge, this is the first observational study to assess violations of California's law. It reports on the availability of flavoured vape products in vape shops and tests whether flavoured vape products were more common in vape shops nearer to college campuses compared with those farther from college campuses, adjusting for neighbourhood demographics. METHODS: Between April and July 2023, observations were recorded at vape shops (n=400) nearer to (≤3 miles) or farther from (>3 miles) a college campus. Vape shops were the focus of this study because a large proportion (48.2%) of US young adults purchase vapes from these venues. Availability of any disposable nicotine vapes, JUUL pods and flavoured varieties of these products were recorded. Multivariable logistic regressions tested relationships between flavoured product availability, proximity to a college campus and store neighbourhood demographics. RESULTS: In violation of California's law, flavoured disposable vapes and/or JUUL pods were available in 50.3% of all vape shops studied. Flavoured disposable vapes were in 53.2% of vape shops with any disposable vapes, and flavoured JUUL pods were in 30.9% of vape shops with any JUUL pods. Contrary to expectation, no significant relationships were identified between the availability of flavoured vapes and proximity to a college campus or store neighbourhood demographics. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed high rates of violations among vape shops within 4 to 7 months after the implementation of California's law. Efforts to improve retailer education and enforcement are warranted.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: A prospective cohort design in the five major counties in Texas was conducted using 12 survey waves from 2014 to 2020 with 3892 students in 6th, 8th and 10th grade at baseline. Growth curve modelling was used to determine the association between self-reported exposure to TRO marketing and P30D use and whether this relationship varied by age. RESULTS: Across ages 11-22, exposure to TRO cigarette marketing increased the odds of P30D cigarette use (OR=1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09) and TRO e-cigarette marketing increased the odds of P30D e-cigarette use (OR=1.06, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.09), on average. The effect of marketing on P30D cigarette use was stable across ages, while the effect on P30D e-cigarette use was stronger at younger ages. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to TRO marketing increases the odds of tobacco product use for youth ageing into young adulthood. E-cigarette marketing may be particularly influential in early adolescence. TRO marketing restrictions are needed to reduce tobacco use among youth and young adults.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: Purchase prices were recorded, and colours, images and words on the containers were assessed. Samples were analysed for nicotine and 180 individual flavour chemicals. Data were examined using the values of several flavour chemical groups, including total fruit flavour chemicals (TFFCs), total non-menthol mint chemicals (TNMMCs) and total menthol/mint chemicals (TM/MCs). RESULTS: All brand variants indicated the nicotine content on the container (6, 10 or 14 mg/pouch). The 14 mg variants were packaged with black container tops and cost 25% more than the others, which had off-white container tops. Measured nicotine levels were similar to the labelled values. 46 of the 180 flavour compounds were detected at least once in the 10 products; four compounds were detected in all 10 products. Variation in the levels of TFFCs, TNMMCs and TM/MCs was much larger than the variation for the measured values of nicotine. CONCLUSION: This is the first independent assessment of oral nicotine pouch brand variants. Nicotine is available over a range of levels; it could be considered as a regulatory target. Consumers are also offered a buffet of options with a range of flavour levels and flavour mixes. Regulation of flavour chemicals in oral nicotine pouches should be considered in Pakistan given that flavours are known to increase product appeal, initiation by adolescents and quitting difficulty.",['Nicotine/NRT'],Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: A randomised crossover trial was conducted among 77 current e-cigarette users aged 21-35 in Miami, Florida, USA. Participants used the same e-cigarette device in two separate sessions, differing by flavour (menthol/tobacco) in random order. Each session involved ad libitum 60 min vaping after 12-hour plasma nicotine-validated abstinence. The primary outcomes were satisfaction, pleasure, enjoyment, appeal and sensory experiences measured after each session. RESULTS: Higher scores were observed in measures of satisfaction, product liking, interest to use in future, willingness to use again, enjoyment, puff liking, taste and craving reduction during the menthol-flavoured e-cigarette session compared with tobacco flavour (all p<0.05). Additionally, participants in the moderate to high-dependence group had overall better subjective experiences (eg, user satisfaction (psychological reward, β=5.34, p<0.001), appeal and sensory experience (puff liking, β=0.64, p=0.04)) in the menthol condition (vs tobacco) compared with low-dependent users. Women also had better experience (eg, user satisfaction (psychological reward, β=3.82, p=0.01)) than men in the menthol condition (vs tobacco). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomised crossover clinical trial, menthol-flavoured e-cigarettes significantly enhanced e-cigarette use experience compared with tobacco flavour. These findings provide important evidence that menthol flavour plays a substantial role in making e-cigarettes more appealing, suggesting that menthol in e-cigarettes poses a risk to nicotine-naïve youth to initiate e-cigarette use and keep those young people currently using, addicted. Therefore, it could be a potential target for regulatory action to limit e-cigarette use among young people.

Industries' responses remain unexplored. METHODS: We analysed 43 consultation and evidence submissions from tobacco and nicotine industry-linked actors, assessing their connections to transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) and using an evidence-based taxonomy to examine framing strategies. RESULTS: TTCs and actors with known current TTC links accounted for 42% of submissions. Other actors-some with historic TTC ties-were other tobacco products (OTPs) specialists, NP specialists and retailers. Tobacco and nicotine industries were generally portrayed as 'good' with TTCs framing themselves as public health champions, while policymakers, the public health community and non-compliant sellers were depicted as 'bad' actors. TTCs, linked groups and additional OTP actors opposed the generational ban, arguing it lacked evidence and would harm the economy and increase violence against retailers. Proposed alternative approaches included exempting heated tobacco products (HTPs) and OTPs, and raising the age of sale to 21. TTCs, linked actors and NP actors opposed restrictions on NP flavours, packaging and display, arguing these would infringe on rights, harm retailers, stifle innovation, and increase smoking and illicit trade. They framed youth NP use as resulting from irresponsible individuals and advocated for education, stricter penalties and self-regulation. CONCLUSION: When faced with tobacco endgame and nicotine control policies in the UK, tobacco and nicotine industries pushed back using framing strategies common to health-harming industries. Despite contradicting their 'transformation' narratives, TTCs still sought to position themselves as public health actors deserving policy access. Advocates, researchers and policymakers can anticipate opposition to endgame policies-such as a generational sales ban-and NP restrictions, proactively preparing to counter this opposition in order to safeguard public health policy from vested interests.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

While ONPs likely expose users to fewer toxicants than cigarettes, they contain nicotine and may initiate, sustain or increase nicotine addiction and dependence. Monitoring the ONP marketplace is essential to inform timely regulatory action. METHODS: We used Nielsen ScanTrack data to analyse ONP sales and prices from 2021 to 2024. Joinpoint regression assessed sales and price trends, and ordinary least squares regression evaluated the association between ONP sales and product characteristics. RESULTS: Monthly ONP unit sales increased significantly, from 327 million in July 2021 to 1046 million in May 2024-more than tripling over this period (p<0.001, average monthly per cent change (AMPC)=3.45). Inflation-adjusted prices also rose, from 19 cents/pouch in June 2021 to 22 cents/pouch in May 2024 (p<0.001, AMPC=0.50). The sales of ZYN, On!, Rogue and VELO account for 99.8% of total sales. ONPs with explicit flavour descriptors outsold those with implicit flavour descriptors by more than eight times. The 'chill' flavour had also gained notable popularity. ONPs with 6 mg and 3 mg nicotine concentrations made up 68% of total sales. Additionally, ONPs with explicit flavour descriptors and higher nicotine concentrations were associated with increased sales. CONCLUSIONS: Policy-makers may need to consider the role of major manufacturers, product flavours, and nicotine content in shaping the market. Continued surveillance is warranted to assess trends in use, particularly among youth and non-tobacco users.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The current study explores methods to quantify e-liquid consumption among youth who currently vape in four countries. METHODS: Data were analysed from the 2023 International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project Youth Surveys, conducted online with national samples in Canada, England, New Zealand and the USA, among 2916 youth aged 16-19 who vaped in the past 30 days. The volume of e-liquid consumed in the past 30 days was estimated from device-specific measures. Linear regression models examined differences in total e-liquid consumption by (1) country, age, sex-at-birth, exclusive versus dual vaping/smoking and device type; (2) four vaping dependence variables (frequency of strong urges, perceived addiction, days vaped, E-cigarette Dependence Scale (EDS) score) and (3) flavour. RESULTS: Across countries, total e-liquid consumption reported in the past 30 days was a median of 9.7 mL and a mean of 22.4 mL. Compared with the USA, e-liquid consumption was greater in Canada (β=4.6, p=0.048) and England (β=4.8, p=0.027). Using multiple device types was associated with greater e-liquid consumption (eg, three device types vs only pods/cartridges: β=54.6, p<0.001). All four dependence indicators were positively associated with consumption, including urges to vape, perceived addiction, days vaped and EDS (all p<0.001). Youth who vaped fruit flavours reported the greatest e-liquid consumption (β=9.1, p=0.001), with some evidence of higher consumption levels for sweet/drinks/other flavours (β=4.3, p=0.093). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest substantial e-liquid consumption among youth who vape in all four countries.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This period saw the introduction of new tax categories for heated tobacco products (HTPs) and electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) with concomitant tax increases. This is the first systematic consideration of taxation on these products. The primary objectives are to examine how tax changes influence product pricing and how HTPs are priced vis-a-vis cigarettes, particularly in the context of harmonisedspecific tax rates. METHODOLOGY: NielsenIQ monthly price and sales data for cigarettes, HTPs, and e-cigs, along with official tax data, were used. Tax pass-through analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between tax increases and retail prices by market segment, with net revenue calculations used to evaluate impacts. RESULTS: The industry usually overshifted taxes on cigarettes (mid-price and premium), HTPs, and e-cigs while undershifting on economy cigarettes during the study period. However, a big HTP tax increase in 2021 was not overshifted to a great extent. The industry also employed a price-smoothing strategy where initial price increases following tax increases were kept moderate, with further increases introduced gradually throughout the year. CONCLUSION: The study shows that the industry has used tax increases on HTPs and e-cigs as an opportunity to raise prices but with lower net revenue per stick. The findings suggest that fully harmonising HTP taxes with those on traditional cigarettes could limit the industry's pricing strategies and hence help reduce consumption and generate additional government revenue.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Understanding sales trends and flavour preferences is critical for assessing these products' public health impact and informing regulatory strategies. OBJECTIVE: To characterise recent trends in US sales of ENDS and ONPs from 2018 to 2023, overall and by flavour. METHODS: Information Resources retail sales data covering 40 states from 7 January 2018 to 16 July 2023, were used to document trends in ENDS and ONP sales from brick-and-mortar retailers, by product flavour (non-menthol, mint/menthol and tobacco/unflavoured) in 4 week periods. RESULTS: ENDS and ONP sales have shown significant growth, with notable fluctuations coinciding with public health concerns and regulatory announcements. Specifically, non-menthol flavoured ENDS initially experienced a decline in sales following regulatory actions in early 2020 but strongly rebounded thereafter. Meanwhile, ONP sales have increased steadily, dominated by mint/menthol flavours. These trends may reflect consumer flavour preferences as well as manufacturers' strategic responses to policy changes. Sensitivity analyses using more recent sales data from 24 states confirm that these patterns persist. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in ENDS and ONP sales trends by flavour type underscore the importance of ongoing, detailed monitoring of nicotine product sales and use, to clarify public health implications and guide regulation. Given the growing variety of nicotine and tobacco products available today, tobacco regulatory frameworks must consider trends across this rapidly evolving market to understand and mitigate associated public health risks.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, there is little regulatory oversight or evidence on their safety and effectiveness. This study assessed the availability, affordability, claims and regulation of HTCPs on Indian e-commerce platforms. METHODS: We systematically searched five major Indian e-commerce platforms (Amazon.in, Flipkart, Blinkit, JioMart and Meesho) using keywords related to herbal tobacco cessation. Product listings were screened and categorised by product type, claimed indications, presence of disclaimers, regulatory approvals and pricing. Findings were summarised descriptively. RESULTS: We identified 316 unique HTCPs across 5 major Indian e-commerce platforms. HTCPs were marketed in three primary formulations: combustible products (42.7%), raw herbal preparations (34.5%) and other formats such as gummies, drops, capsules and patches (22.8%). Products featured diverse flavours (eg, Apple, Paan, Gulkand) and varied widely in pricing (Indian National Rupees (INR)15-INR1467; US$0.18-US$17.67), with premium pricing concentrated on Amazon. Notably, 62.3% of HTCPs carried at least one certification or quality claim, including International Organisation for Standardisation (23.4%), Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (20.3%), Good Manufacturing Practice (15.2%) and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (13.2%). A small fraction (0.5%) referenced WHO affiliation, raising concerns about potentially misleading endorsements. Additionally, 43.7% of products promoted ancillary health claims such as detoxification or anxiety relief. Only 12% of products displayed age restrictions, and none had functional age verification mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: HTCPs are widely available on Indian e-commerce platforms with unverified health claims and minimal regulatory disclosure. This poses significant consumer protection and tobacco control challenges. Strengthened oversight, claim verification and policy alignment with WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control guidelines are urgently needed.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Using artificial intelligence (AI) guided analysis, our goal was to characterise package colour schemes for popular oral nicotine pouch (ONP) brands and examine if colour schemes are associated with ONP characteristics. METHODS: We used an AI-powered tool to analyse colour schemes of publicly available pack images of US ONP brands. We analysed pack images for the seven most popular ONP brands, and the most popular flavours and nicotine concentrations within brands, identified from US sales data (59 images total). We prompted the AI tool to provide colour scheme analysis and proportions (eg, proportion of colour). RESULTS: All brands used specific colours to indicate specific flavours, such as blue for peppermint, green for wintergreen and other warm colours such as red for cinnamon and yellow for citrus. Some brands used lighter colour schemes representing lower nicotine concentration and darker colour schemes representing higher nicotine concentration. On!, Zeo, Zyn and Rogue used a mix of distinct and subtle colour scheme transitions to signify nicotine concentration. Other brands like Sesh, Velo and Zone maintained uniform designs across all nicotine concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the colour scheme of some ONP packaging was designed to indicate the flavour and nicotine concentration. These characteristics may influence consumers' beliefs about ONPs, and appeal to different populations. AI tools can be valuable in the surveillance of those ONP packaging features.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We estimated the prevalence of NP use in 2022 and 2024 among US adults with established nicotine product use. METHODS: Data are from the 2022 (n=2087) and 2024 (n=2083) US ITC Smoking and Vaping Surveys. A nationally representative sample of adults (≥18 years) who smoked cigarettes and/or vaped nicotine or quit smoking and/or vaping completed at least one survey. Using weighted data, generalised estimating equation models were applied to estimate ever-use and current use (≥monthly). Data from both surveys were pooled to examine characteristics related to NP ever-use and current use. RESULTS: Between 2022 and 2024, the prevalence of NP ever-use increased by 42% (16.1%-22.8%, p<0.001), and current use increased by 66% (4.7%-7.8%, p=0.007). NP ever-use increased significantly among all age groups, except adults aged 25-39. Current use increased among all age groups, but only significantly for adults aged 18-24 and 55+. Compared with all other age groups, adults aged 18-24 had an 11.8% greater increase in current use (p=0.045). In the pooled analyses, current NP use was significantly higher among those who were male, were using other smokeless tobacco products (p<0.001), were smoking and vaping (dual use), exclusively vaping or had quit smoking and/or vaping compared with adults who were exclusively smoking (p<0.001). There were non-significant increases in frequency of daily, non-daily and occasional use. CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant increase in NP ever-use and current use between 2022 and 2024 among adults with established nicotine product use, consistent with national sales trends. Further research is needed to determine whether adults are using NPs as a tool to quit smoking or sustain abstinence after quitting.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp products containing no more than 0.3% delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) from regulation as Schedule I controlled substances. Hemp cigarettes that contain no tobacco or nicotine and less than 0.3% THC fall into a loophole in federal law and may evade federal tobacco and drug regulation despite potential health harms. METHODS: In August-September 2024, we analysed TAAT's consumer website to determine whether the manufacturer made 12 marketing claims related to harm reduction or therapeutics that may lead customers to believe that TAATs are safe, safer than other cigarettes, or useful for cessation. RESULTS: We found 307 (36.1%) of 851 sentences on TAAT's website included one or more harm reduction or therapeutic claims. Of the 519 claims identified, the most frequent were for cessation/tobacco/smoking alternative (35.3%), no nicotine (10.2%), no tobacco (8.5%), hemp/CBD/reduced THC (7.3%) and less harmful/better/wellness (6.2%). The website did not provide independent verification to support claims. CONCLUSIONS: TAAT's website contains hundreds of unsubstantiated harm reduction and therapeutic claims. While TAAT hemp cigarettes have evaded FDA regulations that apply to tobacco and drug products, the FDA can enforce laws prohibiting TAAT from making unauthorised therapeutic claims for unapproved products and the Federal Trade Commission can take action for deceptive health claims. States and localities can also prohibit TAAT from marketing cigarettes with unsubstantiated claims.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

This study assesses support for three policies among adults who smoke: (1) ending smoked tobacco sales within 10 years; (2) limiting cigarette nicotine content to make them less addictive; and (3) restricting smoked tobacco sales for life to anyone currently under 18 (Smoke-Free Generation, SFG). METHODS: Data were from the 2022 International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey, including 2723 adults who smoked at least monthly in Australia, Canada, England and the USA. We estimated the weighted prevalence of support and used logistic regression to assess whether support (vs no support) differed by sociodemographic variables (country, gender, age, race/ethnicity, education, income). RESULTS: Support was 27.1% for ending smoked tobacco sales within 10 years, 53.5% for limiting the nicotine content of cigarettes and 51.7% for an SFG law. US adults had consistently lower odds of support compared with those in Canada and England (all policies: p<0.01). Women and white individuals had lower odds of supporting an end to smoked tobacco sales (adjusted OR (aOR): 0.63, p=0.02; 0.68, p=0.03) and an SFG law (aOR: 0.72, p=0.04; 0.66, p=0.01). Women (aOR: 1.41, p<0.01) were more supportive of nicotine reduction. Individuals with moderate (aOR vs high: 1.34, p=0.03) and low (aOR: 1.41, p=0.03) education, and those with financial difficulties (aOR: 1.36, p=0.04) showed higher support for an SFG law. No differences in support were observed by age in the pooled data. CONCLUSIONS: Support for policies to reduce the use of commercial cigarettes was moderate-to-high among adults who smoke, although it varied significantly by country, gender and income. Tailored communication strategies could help increase support and promote policy adoption.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: A randomised experimental design was used. 1204 eligible smokers were randomly assigned either to the control group, which received a self-help kit (video and pamphlet), or to the treatment group, which received the self-help kit and fully covered benefits for over the counter (OTC) nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) gum and patch, and participation in a group behavioural cessation programme with no patient cost sharing. RESULTS: The quit rates after one year of follow up were 18% in the treatment group and 13% in the control group (adjusted odd ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 2.4), controlling for health plan, sociodemographics, baseline smoking characteristics, and use of bupropion. Rates of quit attempts (adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8) and use of nicotine gum or patch (adjusted OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.2) were also higher in the treatment group. The annual cost of the benefit per user who quit ranged from $1495 to $965 or from $0.73 to $0.47 per HMO member per month. CONCLUSIONS: Full coverage of a tobacco dependence treatment benefit implemented in two IPA model HMOs in California has been shown to be an effective and relatively low cost strategy for significantly increasing quit rates, quit attempts, and use of nicotine gum and patch in adult smokers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

METHODS: Analysis of trade sources and internal US tobacco company documents now available on various web sites created by corporations, litigation, or public health bodies. RESULTS: When introducing low yield products, cigarette manufacturers were concerned about maintaining products with acceptable taste/flavour and feared consumers might become weaned from smoking. Several tactics were employed by cigarette manufacturers, leading consumers to perceive filtered and low machine yield brands as safer relative to other brands. Tactics include using cosmetic (that is, ineffective) filters, loosening filters over time, using medicinal menthol, using high tech imagery, using virtuous brand names and descriptors, adding a virtuous variant to a brand's product line, and generating misleading data on tar and nicotine yields. CONCLUSIONS: Advertisements of filtered and low tar cigarettes were intended to reassure smokers concerned about the health risks of smoking, and to present the respective products as an alternative to quitting. Promotional efforts were successful in getting smokers to adopt filtered and low yield cigarette brands. Corporate documents demonstrate that cigarette manufacturers recognised the inherent deceptiveness of cigarette brands described as ""Light""or ""Ultra-Light"" because of low machine measured yields.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

OBJECTIVE: To determine changes in the design of Camel cigarettes in the period surrounding the ""Smooth Character"" advertising campaign and to assess the impact of these changes on youth smoking. DATA SOURCES: Internal documents made available through the document website maintained by RJ Reynolds, manufacturer of Camel cigarettes. STUDY SELECTION: Electronic searches using keywords to identify relevant data. DATA EXTRACTION: A web based index search of documents targeting ""smoothness"" or ""harshness"" and ""younger adult smokers"" (""YAS"") or ""first usual brand younger adult smokers"" (""FUBYAS"") in the 10 year period surrounding the introduction of the ""Smooth Character"" campaign was used to identify Camel related product design research projects. A snowball methodology was used: initial documents were identified by focusing on key words, codes, researchers, committees, meetings, and gaps in overall chronology; a second set of documents was culled from these initial documents, and so on. DATA SYNTHESIS: Product design research led to the introduction of redesigned Camel cigarettes targeted to younger adult males coinciding with the ""Smooth Character"" campaign. Further refinements in Camel cigarettes during the following five year period continued to emphasise the smoothness of the cigarette, utilising additives and blends which reduced throat irritation but increased or retained nicotine impact. CONCLUSIONS: Industry competition for market share among younger adult smokers may have contributed to the reversal of a decline in youth smoking rates during the late 1980s through development of products which were more appealing to youth smokers and which aided in initiation by reducing harshness and irritation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DATA SOURCES: Searched from November 1999 to November 2000 internet databases of industry documents (www.pmdocs.com, www.rjrtdocs.com, www.lorillarddocs.com, www.bw.aalatg.com, www.cdc.gov/tobacco/industrydocs, www.tobaccodocuments.org, www.tobaccopapers.org, www.hlth.gov.bc.ca/Guildford, www.cctc.ca/ncth/Guildford, www.cctc.ca/ncth/Guildford2) for documents related to filter ventilation. Documents found dated from 1955 through 1994. STUDY SELECTION: Those documents judged to contain the most relevant information or data on filter ventilation related to cigarette taste and compensatory smoking, while also trying to avoid redundancy from various documents deriving from the same underlying data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Filter ventilation is a crucial design feature creating three main problems for lower tar cigarettes as measured by official smoking machine testing. Firstly, it misleadingly makes cigarettes taste lighter and milder, and, therefore, they appear less dangerous to smokers. Secondly, it promotes compensation mainly by facilitating the taking of larger puffs. Thirdly, for very heavily ventilated cigarettes (that is, > 65% filter air dilution), behavioural blocking of vents with lips or fingers is an additional contributor to compensatory smoking. These three effects are found in industry research as well as published research. CONCLUSIONS: Filter ventilation is a dangerous, defective technology that should be abandoned in less hazardous nicotine delivery systems. Health interested groups should test cigarettes in a way that reflects compensatory smoking. Lower tar (vented filter) cigarettes should be actively countermarketed.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHOD: Narrative review of published papers and other data sources (for example, conference abstracts and internet based information) on snus use, use of other tobacco products, and changes in health status in Sweden. RESULTS: Snus is manufactured and stored in a manner that causes it to deliver lower concentrations of some harmful chemicals than other tobacco products, although it can deliver high doses of nicotine. It is dependence forming, but does not appear to cause cancer or respiratory diseases. It may cause a slight increase in cardiovascular risks and is likely to be harmful to the unborn fetus, although these risks are lower than those caused by smoking. There has been a larger drop in male daily smoking (from 40% in 1976 to 15% in 2002) than female daily smoking (34% in 1976 to 20% in 2002) in Sweden, with a substantial proportion (around 30%) of male ex-smokers using snus when quitting smoking. Over the same time period, rates of lung cancer and myocardial infarction have dropped significantly faster among Swedish men than women and remain at low levels as compared with other developed countries with a long history of tobacco use. CONCLUSIONS: Snus availability in Sweden appears to have contributed to the unusually low rates of smoking among Swedish men by helping them transfer to a notably less harmful form of nicotine dependence.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

The statement was produced to follow up the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) Tobacco Advisory Group report ""Protecting smokers, saving lives: the case for a tobacco and nicotine regulatory authority"", which argued for an evidence based regulatory approach to smokeless tobacco and harm reduction and posed a series of questions that regulators must address in relation to smokeless tobacco. The purpose of this statement is to provide arguments of fact and principle to follow the RCP's report and to outline the public health case for changing existing European Union (EU) regulation in this area. A review of regulation in relation to harm reduction and regulation of tobacco products other than cigarettes is required in Article 11 of EU directive 2001/37/EC, and this is a contribution towards forming a consensus in the European public health community about what policy the EU should adopt in the light of this review, or following ongoing legal action that may potentially strike out the existing regulation altogether. PUBLIC HEALTH CASE: We believe that the partial ban applied to some forms of smokeless tobacco in the EU should be replaced by regulation of the toxicity of all smokeless tobacco. We hold this view for public health reasons: smokeless tobacco is substantially less harmful than smoking and evidence from Sweden suggests it is used as a substitute for smoking and for smoking cessation. To the extent there is a ""gateway"" it appears not to lead to smoking, but away from it and is an important reason why Sweden has the lowest rates of tobacco related disease in Europe. We think it is wrong to deny other Europeans this option for risk reduction and that the current ban violates rights of smokers to control their own risks. For smokers that are addicted to nicotine and cannot or will not stop, it is important that they can take advantage of much less hazardous forms of nicotine and tobacco-the alternative being to ""quit or die"". and many die. While nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) may have a role in harm reduction, tobacco based harm reduction options may reach more smokers and in a different, market based, way. Chewing tobacco is not banned or regulated in the EU but is often highly toxic, and our proposal could remove more products from the market than it permitted. REGULATORY OPTIONS: We believe that the EU policy on smokeless tobacco should adapt to new scientific knowledge and that the European Commission should bring forward proposals to amend or replace Article 8 of directive 2001/37/EC with a new regulatory framework. Canada has developed testing regimens for tobacco constituents and these could be readily adapted to the European situation. A review of EU policy in this area is required no later than December 2004, and we believe the Commission should expedite the part of its review that deals with harm reduction and regulation of tobacco products other than cigarettes so as to reconsider its policy on smokeless tobacco. We held this view before Swedish Match brought its legal proceedings to challenge EU legislation and we will continue to hold these views if its action fails.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

(2) To review efforts by public health advocates to discredit the ATRF as a public relations tool used by the Australian industry. METHODS: Systematic search of previously internal industry documents released through the US Master Settlement Agreement. RESULTS: The ATRF was headed by prestigious Australian medical scientists, with at least one considered by the industry to be ""industry positive"". An international ATRF symposium on nicotine was vetted by the industry and heavily attended by industry approved scientists. Following sustained criticism from the health and medical community about the industry's creation of the ATRF to further its objectives, the ATRF's scientific committee was provoked to publicly declare in 1988 that smoking was a causative agent in disease. This criticism led to growing ATRF boycotts by scientists and substandard applications, causing the industry to see the ATRF as being poor value-for-money and eventually abandoning it. CONCLUSIONS: The raison d'etre for the ATRF's establishment was to allow the Australian industry to point to its continuing commitment to independent medical research, with the implied corollary that tobacco control measures were premature in the face of insufficient evidence about tobacco's harms. Sustained criticism of tobacco industry funded research schemes can undermine their credibility among the scientific community.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DATA SOURCES: Tobacco industry documents, retail tobacco journals, newspapers, medical journals, and Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria (ACCV) newsletters and archival records. STUDY SELECTION: Documents on the strategies and knowledge bases of the ACCV, other Australian health authorities, and the tobacco industry. RESULTS: The ACCV built a durable system for measuring and publicising the tar and nicotine yields of Australian cigarettes and influencing their development. The tobacco industry initially sought to block the development of this system but later appeared to cooperate with it, as is evidenced by the current market dominance of low tar brands. However, behind the scenes, the industry used its substantial knowledge advantage regarding compensatory smoking and its ability to re-engineer cigarettes to gain effective control of the system and subvert the ACCV's objectives. CONCLUSIONS: Replacement of the low tar programme with new means of minimising the harms from cigarette smoking should be a policy priority for the Australian government. This will require regulation, rather than further voluntary agreements, and stringent monitoring of successor programmes will be necessary.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Published air quality measurements, modelling studies, and dosimetry studies were reviewed, analysed, and generalised. RESULTS: Flight attendants reported suffering greatly from SHS pollution on aircraft. Both government and airline sponsored studies concluded that SHS created an air pollution problem in aircraft cabins, while tobacco industry sponsored studies yielding similar data concluded that ventilation controlled SHS, and that SHS pollution levels were low. Between the time that non-smoking sections were established on US carriers in 1973, and the two hour US smoking ban in 1988, commercial aircraft ventilation rates had declined three times as fast as smoking prevalence. The aircraft cabin provided the least volume and lowest ventilation rate per smoker of any social venue, including stand up bars and smoking lounges, and afforded an abnormal respiratory environment. Personal monitors showed little difference in SHS exposures between flight attendants assigned to smoking sections and those assigned to non-smoking sections of aircraft cabins. CONCLUSIONS: In-flight air quality measurements in approximately 250 aircraft, generalised by models, indicate that when smoking was permitted aloft, 95% of the harmful respirable suspended particle (RSP) air pollution in the smoking sections and 85% of that in the non-smoking sections of aircraft cabins was caused by SHS. Typical levels of SHS-RSP on aircraft violated current (PM(2.5)) federal air quality standards approximately threefold for flight attendants, and exceeded SHS irritation thresholds by 10 to 100 times. From cotinine dosimetry, SHS exposure of typical flight attendants in aircraft cabins is estimated to have been >6-fold that of the average US worker and approximately 14-fold that of the average person. Thus, ventilation systems massively failed to control SHS air pollution in aircraft cabins. These results have implications for studies of the past and future health of flight attendants.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

DESIGN: Cross sectional design involving qualitative outcomes from nine structured focus groups. SUBJECTS: 47 community tobacco control leaders in Minnesota working in the areas of public policy, clinical treatment of nicotine dependence and youth development participated. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants discussed definitions of harm reduction; benefits and risks of harm reduction methods; and how funds for tobacco control research and programmes should be allocated. RESULTS: Results indicated inconsistency about the definition of harm reduction: most groups included a broad range of strategies that extended beyond those typically referenced in the scientific literature. Many participants stated that harm reduction might be beneficial, particularly for smokers who could not or would not quit. However, most also expressed concern about a number of risks, including delivering a mixed message about tobacco, inadvertently benefiting the tobacco industry, and causing unanticipated negative health effects. Participants were inclined to suggest public policy measures (for example, smoking bans, increased taxes) as means for reducing harm. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that even among tobacco control leaders there is a need for common terminology to describe harm reduction approaches and that public policy approaches to harm reduction are considered more dependable than strategies that involve pharmaceutical treatment or rely on the tobacco industry, such as product modification.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

METHODS: Systematic search of internal tobacco industry documents available on the internet and at the British American Tobacco Guildford Depository. RESULTS: Individuals from several tobacco industry companies, led by Philip Morris, designed, funded, conducted, and controlled the presentation of results of a study of IFAQ for the Scandinavian airline SAS in 1988 while attempting to minimise the appearance of industry control. Industry lawyers and scientists deleted results unfavourable to the industry's position from the study before delivering it to the airline. The published version of the study further downplayed the results, particularly with regard to respirable suspended particulates. The study ignored the health implications of the results and instead promoted the industry position that ventilation could solve problems posed by secondhand smoke. CONCLUSIONS: Sponsoring IFAQ studies was one of several tactics the tobacco industry employed in attempts to reverse or delay implementation of in-flight smoking restrictions. As a result, airline patrons and employees, particularly flight attendants, continued to be exposed to pollution from secondhand smoke, especially particulates, which the industry's own consultants had noted exceeded international standards.

METHODS: Tobacco industry document websites were searched for previously secret documents relating to efforts to maintain smoking in Lambert Airport. Testing of SHS contamination in non-smoking areas adjacent to a designated smoking room was conducted at Lambert Airport in 1997-98 and again in 2002. A 1998 comparative test was also performed inside nominally smoke-free Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac Airport). Tests were performed using either static or active nicotine monitors. RESULTS: Industry documents show that the tobacco industry promoted the construction of designated smoking rooms as a way to sidetrack efforts to make Lambert Airport entirely non-smoking. Nicotine vapour air monitoring in a non-smoking area of the airport, adjacent to a smoking room located in Terminal C, reveals elevated levels of ambient nicotine vapour in excess of what would be expected in a completely non-smoking environment. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that airport smoking rooms expose non-smokers in adjacent non-smoking areas to a significant concentration of nicotine vapour from SHS.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DESIGN: Semi-structured telephone interviews on nine topic areas, with qualitative content analysis of coded transcripts. PARTICIPANTS: 29 professionals with expertise related to tobacco and interest in THR, including prominent tobacco control advocates (7), pharmaceutical (3) and tobacco industry scientists/officials (5), non-industry scientists (12), and Congressional staff (2). RESULTS: Respondents agreed that harm reduction is at minimum theoretically plausible, that characteristics of ""good"" and ""bad"" THR products can be identified, that government regulation is essential but not likely in the foreseeable future, and that additional scientific data are very much needed. However, there was no consensus on specifics, such as preferred regulatory strategies or examples of ideal THR products. Disagreement was seen not only across but also within respondent categories. Mistrust of key stakeholders-for example, tobacco control advocates distrust of tobacco industry scientists and vice versa-was pervasive, and cited frequently as a barrier to regulation and collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: Continued dialogue and debate are essential as we enter a new and uncertain era of products purporting to reduce tobacco produced harm. Experts have concluded that effective government regulation is crucial to minimising the risks associated with THR and maximising potential benefits.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DESIGN: Repeated interviews on smoking status and its verification by environmental and biological markers for environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure. SETTING: Urban wives in Osaka City and Sizuoka City, Japan PARTICIPANTS: Semi-random sampling of 200 wives in each city. From the Osaka subjects, 100 non-smoking wives were selected for the validity study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Kappa coefficient for reliability of self reported smoking status. Correlation coefficients between environmental nicotine concentration, cotinine in saliva and urine, and self reported smoking status. RESULTS: The kappa coefficient for the repeated interview was high suggesting sufficient reliability of the response. The proportion of self reported current smokers misclassified as non-smokers was equivalent to the misclassified self reported non-smokers. Ambient concentration of nicotine and personal exposure to nicotine correlated with each other and also with salivary cotinine and self reported ETS exposure but not with urinary cotinine/creatinine ratio (CCR). There was no major difference in diet and lifestyle related to husband's smoking status. CONCLUSION: Self reported smoking status by Japanese wives shows high reliability. It also shows high validity when verified by both nicotine exposure and salivary cotinine, but not by CCR. A previous report questioning the credibility of self reported smoking status, based on questionable CCR, could thus be of dubious validity. In addition, possible dietary and lifestyle confounding factors associated with smoking husbands were not demonstrable, a finding not reported previously. Using all the data from this project changes the conclusion of the previous published report. In addition to the distortion of scientific findings by a tobacco industry affiliated researcher, anti-smoking campaigners made attempts to intimidate and suppress scientific activities. These distortions of science should be counteracted.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Tobacco industry development of low nicotine cigarettes.,"BACKGROUND: Defining harm reduction and regulating potentially reduced exposure products (PREPs), including low nicotine products, are key issues in tobacco control policy. The US Congress has been considering legislation authorising the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate tobacco products. OBJECTIVE: To investigate tobacco industry perceptions, interests, motivations, and knowledge regarding the marketability of low nicotine tobacco products. METHODS: Qualitative analysis of internal tobacco industry documents identified in the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library between February 2002 and June 2004. Search terms included low-, no-, reduced-nicotine; denicotinization; low-, reduced- alkaloids; Next; de-nic; and key names of people, organisations, projects, and their common abbreviations and acronyms. RESULTS: The tobacco industry has made repeated efforts to develop low nicotine cigarettes. Reasons for doing so include consumer appeal and economic importance in a highly competitive cigarette market for ""healthier"" products. The industry considered the development of a new ""denic"" market segment a critical challenge. CONCLUSIONS: The tobacco industry exploits consumer misunderstanding of the health effects of nicotine in development and marketing efforts. The industry has risked the development of a less addictive product to expand the market reach of tobacco products based on perceived health benefits and appeal to quitters.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DESIGN: Systematic keyword and opportunistic website searches of formerly private internal industry documents. RESULTS: Industry documents show that RJ Reynolds developed marketing plans based upon their cultural assumptions of Japanese people as fastidious about hygiene and manners, and with relatively high penchants to try new products. RJ Reynolds found there was also a growing concern for health, the environment, and smokers were conscious about annoying others. Deodorised consumer products were one of Japan's biggest trends. These characteristics presented RJ Reynolds with a profitable formula for marketing Salem Pianissimo, a clean cigarette with less smell and smoke. Salem Pianissimo, a 100 mm cigarette claiming to contain 1 mg tar and 0.1 mg nicotine, targeted women since menthol cigarettes were popular among 18-24 year old female smokers, although Japan's law prohibited those below 20 years to smoke and the tobacco industry had a voluntary code disallowing advertising to women and youth. CONCLUSION: RJ Reynolds successfully launched its clean cigarette, Salem Pianissimo, in Japan aiming to exploit perceived cultural characteristics such as a penchant for cleanliness, an eagerness to try new products, and social harmony.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: The data for this paper come from the opening statements made by defendants in four court cases: two class action lawsuits (Engle 1999, and Blankenship 2001) and two individual cases (Boeken 2001, and Schwarz 2002). The transcripts of opening statements were reviewed and statements about product defect claims, product testing, and safe cigarette research were excerpted and coded. RESULTS: Responses by cigarette companies to charges that their products were defective has been presented consistently across different cases and by different companies. Essentially the arguments made by cigarette companies boil down to three claims: (1) smoking is risky, but nothing the companies have done has made cigarettes more dangerous than might otherwise be the case; (2) nothing the companies have done or said has kept someone from stopping smoking; and (3) the companies have spent lots of money to make the safest cigarette acceptable to the smoker. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette companies have argued that their products are inherently dangerous but not defective, and that they have worked hard to make their products safer by lowering the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes as recommended by members of the public health community. As a counter argument, plaintiff attorneys should focus on how cigarette design changes have actually made smoking more acceptable to smokers, thereby discouraging smoking cessation.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

RESULTS: There have been at least 15 failed litigation cases in Argentina and the tobacco industry presented a concerted defence in every claim regardless of cost. We categorised 11 cases as product liability and nicotine addiction, two as health care reimbursement, and two as criminal law and secondhand smoke. Industry strategies included hiring legal consultants from prestigious international and Argentinean law firms and developing litigation prevention programmes. Industry monitored legal academic meetings, controlled the development of new product liability legislation, obtained favourable opinions from experts, and closely observed the development of litigation in Argentina. CONCLUSION: The strategies used by the industry have been successful in preventing recovery for tobacco injuries through litigation. Argentinean health advocates and lawyers need to be aware of the roles and strategies of the tobacco industry in order to develop effective litigation in Argentina.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

DESIGN: Percentages of cigarettes exhibiting full length burns (FLBs), cigarette sales before and following the implementation of the New York standards, a sample of retail cigarette prices, brand availability, and selected smoke constituent yields were compared between cigarettes sold in New York and two other states. Cigarette paper analysis was conducted on cigarettes sold in New York. RESULTS: New York cigarette brands averaged 10.0% FLBs as compared to 99.8% for California and Massachusetts brands. Reduced ignition propensity (RIP) appears to have been achieved by cigarette paper banding. Cigarette sales, prices, and brand availability do not appear to have been affected by the New York standards. Yields of the majority of smoke constituents tested did not differ substantially between RIP cigarettes sold in New York as compared to the same brands sold in Massachusetts. Average yields of tar, carbon monoxide, and two compounds were slightly higher, the yields of seven compounds were higher for one brand only, and nicotine was lower, among New York brands tested. CONCLUSIONS: RIP cigarette brands have been designed to meet the New York fire safety standards. Their introduction has not affected cigarette sales or prices in New York. There is no evidence that the small increases in smoke constituent yields affect the already highly toxic nature of cigarette smoke. Data on smoking caused fires, deaths, and injuries dating from after the change in law are not yet available. Such data will be able to address the question of whether the demonstrated reduced ignition standards are associated with reduced fires and injuries. Based on the New York experience, prior industry objections to producing RIP cigarettes are unfounded. Other states and nations should adopt similar standards.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Despite the fact that several companies now claim to accept, in varying degrees, the conclusions of the Surgeon General concerning tobacco addiction, the tobacco industry litigation strategy pertaining to addiction is essentially unchanged since that of the early 1980s when the issue emerged as crucial. The industry uses its experts and the process of cross-examination of plaintiff's experts to imply that the addictiveness of tobacco and nicotine are more comparable to substances such as caffeine, chocolate, and even milk, than to heroin, cocaine and alcohol. Furthermore, the tobacco industry contends that the definition of addiction has now become so broadened as to include carrots and caffeine and hence that any concurrence that smoking is addictive, does not imply that cigarettes are addictive to the standards that drugs such as heroin and cocaine are addictive. Finally, the industry has continuously asserted that tobacco users assumed the risks of tobacco since they understood that quitting could be difficult when they began to use, and moreover, that the main barrier to cessation is lack of desire or motivation to quit and not physical addiction. These positions have been maintained through the 2004-2005 US Government litigation that was ongoing as the time of this writing.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

One critical area of research is the role of smoke chemistry in determining the absorption and effects of smoke constituents, especially harm producing or pharmacologically active compounds. Independent scientific research has suggested that the nicotine dosing characteristics, hence the addiction potential of cigarettes, may be determined in part by the amount of free-base nicotine in cigarette smoke and its effects on the location, route, and speed of absorption in the body and on the sensory perception effects of the inhaled smoke. Tobacco industry documents describe the use of a number of methods internally for measuring free-base nicotine delivery. These include the common use of cigarette ""smoke pH"" as a means to estimate the fraction of free-base nicotine in the particulate matter (PM) in cigarette smoke, as well as efforts to measure free-base nicotine directly. Although these methods do not provide accurate absolute measures of free-base nicotine in smoke, consistencies observed in the findings across the various manufacturers indicate: (1) real relative differences in the acid/base chemistry of the smoke from different brands of cigarettes; (2) a connection between differences in free-base levels and brand-dependent differences in sensory perception and smoke ""impact""; and (3) levels of free-base nicotine that are greater than have typically been publicly discussed by the industry. Furthermore, the results of these methods are generally consistent with those of a recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which directly measured the free-base fraction of nicotine across a range of cigarette types. Consideration of the likely fundamental importance of free-base nicotine levels in cigarette smoke, together with the efforts discussed in the tobacco industry documents to measure such levels, indicates that the public health community would benefit from additional research to assess directly the delivery of free-base nicotine in cigarette smoke across brands. This may be especially useful for those products (""light"", ""ultralight"", ""reduced carcinogen"", etc) that have been promoted, either explicitly or implicitly, as ""harm reducing"".","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data from a cross-sectional survey completed by 6752 adult Swedes in 2001-2 focusing on identifying tobacco use history by survey items on current and prior tobacco use and smoking initiation and cessation procedures. RESULTS: 15% of the men and 19% of the women completing the survey were daily smokers. 21% of the men and 2% of the women were daily snus users. Almost all (91%) male daily smoking began before the age of 23 years, whereas initiation of daily snus use continued throughout the age range (33% of initiation after age 22). 20% of male primary snus users started daily smoking compared to 47% of non-primary snus users. Thus, the odds of initiating daily smoking were significantly lower for men who had started using snus than for those who had not (odds ratio (OR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.36). Among male primary smokers, 28% started secondary daily snus use and 73% did not. 88% of those secondary snus users had ceased daily smoking completely by the time of the survey as compared with 56% of those primary daily smokers who never became daily snus users (OR 5.7, 95% CI 4.9 to 8.1). Among men who made attempts to quit smoking, snus was the most commonly used cessation aid, being used by 24% on their latest quit attempt. Of those men who had used one single cessation aid 58% had used snus, as compared with 38% for all nicotine replacement therapy products together. Among men who used snus as a single aid, 66% succeeded in quitting completely, as compared with 47% of those using nicotine gum (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.7) or 32% for those using the nicotine patch (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.1 to 8.6). Women using snus as an aid were also significantly more likely to quit smoking successfully than those using nicotine patches or gum. CONCLUSION: Use of snus in Sweden is associated with a reduced risk of becoming a daily smoker and an increased likelihood of stopping smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

DESIGN: Biennial postal surveys in 1981-2003. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Entire Finland; 12-, 14-, 16-, and 18-year-olds (n = 73,946; 3105-8390 per year). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Snus use (experimental, daily/occasionally), snus acquisition (2001, 2003). RESULTS: Snus experimentation grew in popularity before the total sales ban in 16- and 18-year-old boys and after the ban in all age and sex groups. A decrease was seen between 2001 and 2003, except for 18-year-old boys. Daily/occasional use mainly followed the same pattern in boys while in girls the daily/occasional use was rare and no significant changes were observed. In 2003, boys experimented with snus more often than girls (12-year-olds 1% v 0%, 14-year-olds 9% v 4%, 16-year-olds 30% v 12%, 18-year-olds 44% v 18%). Hardly any girls used snus daily/occasionally, but 1% of 14-year-old boys, 7% of 16-year-olds, and 9% of 18-year-olds did. Of daily/occasional users, 84% acquired snus from friends or acquaintances, 55% from tourist trips to neighbouring countries (Estonia, Sweden), and 7% through sport teams; 24% obtained it from under-the-counter sources. For experimenters, the corresponding figures were 79%, 18%, 0.3%, and 5%. CONCLUSIONS: The total sales ban did not stop snus use; instead, the increase continued after the ban. Friends who travel to neighbouring countries act as go-betweens reselling snus. Snus is used even by the youngest adolescents, thus contributing to the nicotine dependence process.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHOD: MUS cigarettes were purchased in Tampa, Florida; Marlboro regular and Holiday were purchased in Auckland, New Zealand, and all emissions tested by Labstat International Inc, Kitchener, Ontario under Health Canada Intensive (HCI) machine-smoking conditions (55 ml puff per 30 seconds, filter ventilation holes blocked) against: (1) previous same brand emissions tested under ISO (International Organization for Standardization) conditions; (2) ISO and HCI average emissions for 16 regular brands sold in British Columbia (BC), the reference standard. Toxicants, selected by toxicological risk assessment, enabled estimation of an RTE per brand, and RTE per mg of nicotine. RESULTS: The BC standard for RTE in both ISO and HCI test modes, including metals and nitrosamines, was set at 100. Hereafter excluding them, RTE in ISO mode for BC was 97, MUS 4, Marlboro 102, and Holiday regular 99; and in HCI test mode BC was 97, MUS 42, Marlboro regular 107, and Holiday 95. From ISO to HCI, MUS total puff volume increased 50%, from 252 ml to 380 ml; nicotine yield increased 2.6 fold. Normalising for nicotine (RTE per mg nicotine), in ISO test mode, the BC standard was 97, MUS 10, Marlboro regular 124, and Holiday regular 107. In HCI mode, however, MUS/nicotine at 104 exceeded the average BC standard of 97; Marlboro regular was 137, and Holiday regular 97; MUS ranked sixth highest among 18 regular brands. MUS contained 103 mg of carbon in its 304 mg filter, which was 55% ventilated. CONCLUSION: The combined acetate-carbon filter of MUS performed best at low smoke volumes on ISO testing. Under more smoker-realistic intensive machine testing, and correcting for relative nicotine concentration and compensatory smoking, MUS increased the RTE, for all toxicants combined, for carcinogens, and for cardiovascular toxicants, compared with most regular brands. MUS was not a potentially reduced-exposure product (PREP) under smoker-realistic test conditions, and thus would not be expected to reduce overall harm. It is unrealistic to expect that even major design changes, as seen in MUS, or a regulatory framework to enforce such changes, could reduce cigarette smoking mortality risks to acceptable levels.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The commercial use of filter ventilation was precipitated by the 1964 United States Surgeon-General's report, further advanced by the adoption of an official Federal Trade Commission test in 1967, and still further advanced by the inclusion of a gas phase (carbon monoxide) measure in 1979. The first vented-filter brand on the market in the United States (Carlton) in 1964 and the second major vented-filter brand (True) in 1966 illustrate this. Ultimately, filter ventilation became a virtually required way to make very low tar cigarettes (less than 10 mg or, even more so, less than 5 mg tar). The key to the lower tar cigarette was not, in effect, the advanced selective filtration design characteristics or sophisticated tobacco selection or processing as envisioned by experts (although these techniques were and are used); the key to the very much lower tar cigarette was simply punching holes in the filter. We propose that the banning of filter vents, coupled with low maximum standard tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide yields, would contribute to making cigarettes much less palatable and foster smoking cessation or the use of clearly less hazardous nicotine delivery systems. It may be necessary to link low maximum yields with the banning of filter ventilation to achieve public health benefit from such maxima.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

There are four items that need to be considered in negligence torts: legal duty, a breach of that duty, causal relationship between breach and injury, and damages. OBJECTIVE: To identify the arguments related to legal duty. RESULTS: The Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence (revised 2000) CPG, sponsored by the US Public Health Service, recommends effective and inexpensive treatments for nicotine addiction, the largest preventable cause of death in the US, and can be used as an example to focus on important considerations about the appropriateness of CPGs in the judicial system. Furthermore, the failure of many doctors and hospitals to deal with tobacco use and dependence raises the question of whether this failure could be considered malpractice, given the Public Health Service guideline's straightforward recommendations, their efficacy in preventing serious disease and cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Although each case of medical malpractice depends on a multitude of factors unique to individual cases, a court could have sufficient basis to find that the failure to adequately treat the main cause of preventable disease and death in the US qualifies as a violation of the legal duty that doctors and hospitals owe to patients habituated to tobacco use and dependence.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

METHODS: Machine-based measures of nicotine yield in smoke and measures of cigarette design features related to nicotine delivery (ventilation, nicotine content in the tobacco rod and number of puffs), as well as market category descriptors, were obtained from annual reports filed with the Massachusetts Department of Public by tobacco manufacturers for 1997-2005. Trends in nicotine yield and its relationship with design features and market parameters were analysed with multilevel mixed-effects regression modelling procedures. RESULTS: A statistically significant trend was confirmed in increased nicotine yield, of 0.019 (1.1%) mg/cig/year over the period 1997-2005 and 0.029 (1.6%) mg/cig/year over the period 1998-2005. The increasing trend was observed in all major market categories (mentholated vs non-mentholated, and full flavour vs light, medium (mild) or ultralight). Nicotine yield in smoke was positively associated with nicotine concentration in the tobacco and number of puffs per cigarette, both of which showed increasing trends during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms increased machine-measured levels of nicotine, the addictive agent in cigarettes, in smoke, to be a result of increased nicotine in the tobacco rod and other design modifications.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: We reviewed industry documents on origins of the FTC test and datasets provided by the Tobacco Institute Testing Laboratory to the tobacco industry and FTC for reporting purposes. RESULTS: The majority of the tobacco industry argued for ""dual reporting"" of tar yields-both per cigarette and per puff. Despite a request from the Tobacco Institute in 1967 that puff count information be preserved, documents and recent communications with the FTC indicate that puff number data have not been maintained by the government. In contrast, for the cigarette industry, puff count data are a fundamental and routine part of testing and important to cigarette design. A sample of puff counts for cigarettes tested in 1996 (n = 471) shows that on average 100 mm cigarettes have 18% more puffs taken on them than do 85 mm cigarettes in standard tests (7.66 vs 9.03; p<0.01). The 10th percentile puff count is 6.8 and the 90th percentile is 8.8 for king size; the 10th percentile puff count is 8.2 and the 90th percentile is 10.0 for 100 mm cigarettes, indicating that puff counts can vary substantially among brands. CONCLUSIONS: The FTC has failed to seek or preserve puff count information that the industry finds important.

RESULTS: Agricultural practices (for example, fertilisers, curing), plant characteristics (for example, protein content, nicotine content), tobacco blending (for example, American blend vs Virginia blend) and cigarette design (for example, additives, filters, paper) issues all have roles in the generation and reduction of specific smoke toxicants. The tobacco industry has explored a number of technologies, including selective filtration, changes to curing practices and rod additives to reduce specific toxicants.

Previous research has shown that major manufacturers of smokeless tobacco products manipulated free nicotine, the form most readily absorbed, to promote tolerance and addiction.

This study looks at the current total US moist snuff market with product design data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health; moist snuff use from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health; market data from ACNielsen; and magazine advertising expenditures from TNS Media Intelligence. RESULTS: (1) The levels of free nicotine of moist snuff products have increased over time for several major manufacturers; (2) the number and variety of sub-brands have increased over time; (3) changes in design, as reflected by variation in free nicotine associated with pH or tobacco leaf, or both, have enhanced the ease and uniformity of dosing; (4) marketing through price and advertising has increased; and (5) youth use has increased. CONCLUSION: A combination of factors including brand proliferation, control of free nicotine and product design has most likely resulted in the expanded consumption of moist snuff, particularly among young people.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This marketing occurs despite an absence of objective data concerning the toxicant exposure and effects of these PREPs. Methods used to examine combustible PREPs were adapted to assess the acute effects of non-combustible PREPs for smokers. METHODS: 28 overnight abstinent cigarette smokers (17 men, 14 non-white) each completed seven, Latin-squared ordered, approximately 2.5 h laboratory sessions that differed by product administered: Ariva, Marlboro Snus (Philip Morris, USA), Camel Snus (RJ Reynolds, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA), Commit nicotine lozenge (GlaxoSmithKline; 2 mg), own brand cigarettes, Quest cigarettes (Vector Tobacco; delivers very low levels of nicotine) and sham smoking (ie, puffing on an unlit cigarette). In each session, the product was administered twice (separated by 60 min), and plasma nicotine levels, expired air CO and subjective effects were assessed regularly. RESULTS: Non-combustible products delivered less nicotine than own brand cigarettes, did not expose smokers to CO and failed to suppress tobacco abstinence symptoms as effectively as combustible products. CONCLUSIONS: While decreased toxicant exposure is a potential indicator of harm reduction potential, a failure to suppress abstinence symptoms suggests that currently marketed non-combustible PREPs may not be a viable harm reduction strategy for US smokers.

Manufacturers have developed new products that represent cigarette brand extension and in test marketing are promoting dual use of cigarettes and snuff. This study examined patterns of concurrent use of smokeless tobacco (ST) and cigarettes among young people and adults in the USA just before cigarette companies' control of the nation's ST market. METHODS: Data were drawn from four US nationally representative surveys. Stratified analyses applied sampling weights and accounted for the complex sample designs. RESULTS: Cigarette smoking was substantially more prevalent among young males who used ST than among those who did not. Among adult males, those who smoked daily were less likely than others to have used snuff every day. Men who used moist snuff daily had the lowest prevalence of daily smoking, but the prevalence of daily smoking was relatively high among men who used moist snuff less than daily. Unsuccessful past-year attempts by daily smokers to quit smoking were more prevalent among non-daily snuff users (41.2%) than among those who had never used snuff (29.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Although dual daily use of ST and cigarettes is relatively uncommon in the USA, concurrent ST use is more common among adolescent and young adult male smokers than among more mature tobacco users. Among adult males, daily smoking predominates and non-daily ST use is very strongly associated with current smoking. Adult male smokers who also use ST daily tend to have relatively high levels of serum cotinine and high prevalence of a major indicator for tobacco dependence.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Major US tobacco companies (RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris) are marketing snus products as cigarette brand line extensions. The population effects of smokeless tobacco promotion will depend on the combined effects of changes in individual risk with population changes in tobacco use patterns. OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively evaluate the health impact of smokeless tobacco promotion as part of a harm reduction strategy in the US. METHODS: A Monte Carlo simulation of a decision tree model of tobacco initiation and use was used to estimate the health effects associated with five different patterns of increased smokeless tobacco use. RESULTS: With cigarette smoking having a health effect of 100, the base case scenario (based on current US prevalence rates) yields a total health effect of 24.2 (5% to 95% interval 21.7 to 26.5) and the aggressive smokeless promotion (less cigarette use and increased smokeless, health-concerned smokers switching to snus, smokers in smokefree environments switching to snus) was associated with a health effect of 30.4 (5% to 95% interval 25.9 to 35.2). The anticipated health effects for additional scenarios with lower rates of smokeless uptake also overlapped with the base case. CONCLUSIONS: Promoting smokeless tobacco as a safer alternative to cigarettes is unlikely to result in substantial health benefits at a population level.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

METHODS: This study analysed internal documents that describe the results of human EEG studies conducted by tobacco manufacturers. Emphasis was placed on documents that pertain to the application of EEG to product evaluation efforts. RESULTS: Internal EEG research was used to determine dose-response relations and effective threshold levels for nicotine, emphasising the importance of form and mechanism of nicotine delivery for initiating robust central nervous system (CNS) effects. Internal studies also highlight the importance of human behaviour during naturalistic smoking, revealing neurophysiological markers of compensation during smoking of reduced nicotine cigarettes. Finally, internal research demonstrates the effectiveness of EEG for the evaluation of non-nicotine phenomena including smoke-component discrimination by smokers, classification of sensory characteristics and measurement of hedonics and other subjective effects. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco manufacturers successfully developed objective, EEG-based techniques to evaluate the influence of product characteristics on acceptance and use. Internal results suggest that complex interactions between pharmacological, sensory and behavioural factors mediate the brain changes that occur with smoking. These findings have implications for current proposals regarding the regulation of tobacco products and argue for the incorporation of objective measures of product effects when evaluating the health risks of new and existing tobacco products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The China National Tobacco Corporation (CNTC) promotes low-tar cigarettes as safer than regular cigarettes. METHODS: A total of 543 male smokers smoking cigarettes with different tar yields (15 mg, regular cigarettes, 10-13 mg low-tar cigarettes and < 10 mg low-tar cigarettes) were recruited in Shanghai, China, who then completed a questionnaire on smoking behaviour and provided a urine sample for analysis of the nicotine metabolites cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine. A total of 177 urine samples were selected at random for the analysis of the carcinogens polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites (PAHs) (1-hydroxypyrene, naphthols, hydroxyfluorenes and hydroxyphenanthrenes) and the tobacco specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-butanone (NNK) metabolites, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-butanol (NNAL) and NNAL-glucuronide. Values were normalised by creatinine to correct for possible distortions introduced by dilution or concentration of the urine. RESULTS: Smokers of low-tar cigarettes smoked fewer cigarettes per day (p=0.001) compared to smokers of regular cigarettes. Despite this lower reported consumption, levels of cotinine, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine and PAHs in urine of people smoking low-tar cigarettes were not correlated with nominal tar delivery of the cigarettes they smoked. Urine concentrations of NNAL were higher in smokers of lower tar than higher tar cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese low-tar cigarettes do not deliver lower doses of nicotine and carcinogens than regular cigarettes, therefore it is unlikely that there would be any reduction in harm. CNTC's promotion of low-tar cigarettes as 'less harmful' is a violation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which China ratified in 2005.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

To relate the packaging and labelling of new cigarette varieties to their construction and performance. METHODS: The principal design features and tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields of the Marlboro 'brand family' in Australia were measured and compared with those of the US equivalents. RESULTS: Marlboro Red and Blue/Medium, could not be differentiated in preliminary tests in Australia, but were different in the USA. However, yield testing showed Marlboro Blue/Medium did not have lower tar and nicotine yields in either country, indeed being higher in Australia. CONCLUSIONS: Colour can be used to market cigarettes as 'milder', independently of ISO yields and 'Light'/'Mild' descriptors. Banning of 'Light' and 'Mild' brand descriptors may be inadequate to end belief in less harmful cigarettes so long as the tobacco industry remains free to engineer 'mildness' and to use colours, other descriptors and design features to characterise varieties it wants to market as 'milder'.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Both regulatory approaches allow establishing product standards for tobacco constituents, including nicotine. The FSPTCA does not allow nicotine levels to be decreased to zero, although the FDA has the authority to reduce nicotine yields to very low, presumably non-addicting levels. The proposal to reduce levels of nicotine to a level that is non-addicting was originally suggested in 1994. Reduction of nicotine in tobacco products could potentially have a profound impact on reducing tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. To examine this issue, two meetings were convened in the US with non-tobacco-industry scientists of varied disciplines, tobacco control policymakers and representatives of government agencies. This article provides an overview of the current science in the area of reduced nicotine content cigarettes and key conclusions and recommendations for research and policy that emerged from the deliberations of the meeting members.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Promotion included use of a brand website, a relatively new marketing channel used by tobacco companies, which allowed visitors to learn about the product and discuss it with others on the website's message board. Our study aimed to examine early experiences with and perceptions of Camel Snus as described by board contributors and also to consider the use and benefits of the message board for both consumers and the company. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative analysis, coding each message in Atlas.Ti and analysing it for emerging themes and patterns. Messages were also coded for demographic information where evident, such as tobacco use status and geographical location. Descriptive data and illustrative quotes are presented. RESULTS: Board participants described being introduced to Camel Snus through free samples. Favourable evaluations were posted by current smokers who had never tried SLT before as well as current users of other SLT brands. Messages indicated both initiation of dual product use among smokers and product substitution. Participants used the board to advise each other on how to use the product, where to get more, suggest ways RJ Reynolds could improve the product and to encourage RJ Reynolds to release it nationally. DISCUSSION: Camel Snus has appeal for at least some smokers and SLT users. Camel Snus' website message board may have been a doubly beneficial marketing feature in both connecting product users and providing product feedback to the company during test-marketing.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: A snowball strategy was used to systematically search the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library (http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/) between 22 February and 29 April, 2010. Of the approximately 11 million documents available in the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library, the iterative searches returned tens of thousands of results. We qualitatively analysed a final collection of 309 documents relevant the effects of menthol on nicotine dependence. RESULTS: The tobacco industry knows that menthol overrides the harsh taste of tobacco and alleviates nicotine's irritating effects, synergistically interacts with nicotine, stimulates the trigeminal nerve to elicit a 'liking' response for a tobacco product, and makes low tar, low nicotine tobacco products more acceptable to smokers than non-mentholated low delivery products. CONCLUSION: Menthol is not only used in cigarettes as a flavour additive; tobacco companies know that menthol also has sensory effects and interacts with nicotine to produce tobacco products that are easier to smoke, thereby making it easier to expose smokers, especially those who are new and uninitiated, to the addictive power of nicotine.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: A snowball strategy was used to systematically search the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library (http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu) between 1 June 2010 and 9 August 2010. We qualitatively analysed a final collection of 252 documents related to menthol and smoking topography. RESULTS: The tobacco industry knew that menthol has cooling, anaesthetic and analgesic properties that moderate the harshness and irritation of tobacco. Owing to its physiological effects, menthol contributes to the sensory qualities of the smoke and affects smoking topography and cigarette preference. CONCLUSION: Our review of industry studies suggests that the amount of menthol in a cigarette is associated with how the cigarette is smoked and how satisfying it is to the smoker. If menthol in cigarettes was banned, as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently considering, new/experimental smokers might choose not to smoke rather than experience the harshness of tobacco smoke and the irritating qualities of nicotine. Similarly, established menthol smokers might choose to quit if faced with an unpleasant smoking alternative.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Some tobacco smokers report that they used ENDS as a smoking cessation aid. Whether sold as tobacco products or drug delivery devices, these products need to be regulated, and thus far, across countries and states, there has been a wide range of regulatory responses ranging from no regulation to complete bans. The empirical basis for these regulatory decisions is uncertain, and more research on ENDS must be conducted in order to ensure that the decisions of regulators, health care providers and consumers are based on science. However, there is a dearth of scientific research on these products, including safety, abuse liability and efficacy for smoking cessation. The authors, who cover a broad range of scientific expertise, from basic science to public health, suggest research priorities for non-clinical, clinical and public health studies. They conclude that the first priority is to characterize the safety profile of these products, including in long-term users. If these products are demonstrated to be safe, their efficacy as smoking cessation aids should then be tested in appropriately designed trials. Until these studies are conducted, continued marketing constitutes an uncontrolled experiment and the primary outcome measure, poorly assessed, is user health. Potentially, this research effort, contributing to the safety and efficacy of new smoking cessation devices and to the withdrawal of dangerous products, could save many lives.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

DATA SOURCES: Papers published in this supplement of Tobacco Control, together with papers identified using PubMed searches. RESULTS: Tobacco companies shaped consumer perceptions of menthol cigarettes. Menthol is not just a flavouring agent. Cigarette companies use menthol's ability to mask irritation and provide sensory effects to make menthol cigarettes appeal to youth and health-concerned smokers, in part because menthol makes low-tar cigarettes more palatable. Consistent with targeted marketing, youths, women and African Americans disproportionately smoke menthols. There appear to be complex interactions with addictive effects of nicotine. The ubiquitous addition of menthol by tobacco companies to over 90% of all tobacco products, whether labelled 'menthol' or not, demonstrates that menthol is not simply a flavour or brand. Menthol imparts sensory characteristics to cigarettes and has a complex interaction with nicotine that affects smoking behaviour whether it is perceived or not, or whether cigarettes containing menthol are marketed as 'menthol' or not. Adding menthol increases fine particles in cigarette smoke, which have immediate adverse effects on the risk of heart attack. CONCLUSION: Information from industry documents, confirmed by independent scientific literature, consistently demonstrates that menthol increases population harm from smoking by increasing initiation and reducing cessation in some groups. Menthol facilitates and increases smoking, which causes disease and death.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

DATA SOURCES: Medline database 1966-97 using the following subject headings and keywords: nicotine, absorption, mouth mucosa, skin, hydrogen-ion concentration, smokeless tobacco, biological transport, and membranes; computer database of the tobacco bibliography maintained by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health; bibliographies of pertinent journal articles, books, and governmental reports; personal communications with experts in nicotine pharmacology and addiction; and Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation documents in the Tobacco Control Archives of the University of California, San Francisco. STUDY SELECTION: Included all relevant animal studies, in-vitro studies, nicotine replacement therapy trials, and human observational studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: We found that the effects of pH on drug absorption have been well established in animal models for nicotine and many other acidic or basic compounds. Increased alkalinity promotes the absorption of nicotine and increases its physiological effects. Human studies, which are more limited, confirm these processes. For example, nicotine absorption is directly related to the pH when nicotine is delivered in either tobacco smoke or nicotine polacrilex gum. CONCLUSIONS: Although other factors could influence the rate of nicotine absorption from oral tobacco, manipulating tobacco pH appears to be the primary means by which the speed of nicotine absorption is determined in moist-snuff products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of reducing tobacco-caused disease by gradually removing nicotine from cigarettes until they would not be effective causes of nicotine addiction. DATA SOURCES: Issues posed by such an approach, and potential solutions, were identified from analysis of literature published by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in its 1996 Tobacco Rule, comments of the tobacco industry and other institutions and individuals on the rule, review of the reference lists of relevant journal articles, other government publications, and presentations made at scientific conferences. DATA SYNTHESIS: The role of nicotine in causing and sustaining tobacco use was evaluated to project the impact of a nicotine reduction strategy on initiation and maintenance of, and relapse to, tobacco use. A range of potential concerns and barriers was addressed, including the technical feasibility of reducing cigarette nicotine content to non-addictive levels, the possibility that compensatory smoking would reduce potential health benefits, and whether such an approach would foster illicit (""black market"") tobacco sales. Education, treatment, and research needs to enable a nicotine reduction strategy were also addressed. The Council on Scientific Affairs came to the following conclusions: (a) gradually eliminating nicotine from cigarettes is technically feasible; (b) a nicotine reduction strategy holds great promise in preventing adolescent tobacco addiction and assisting the millions of current cigarette smokers in their efforts to quit using tobacco products; (c) potential problems such as compensatory over-smoking of denicotinised cigarettes and black market sales could be minimised by providing alternate forms of nicotine delivery with less or little risk to health, as part of expanded access to treatment; and (d) such a strategy would need to be accompanied by relevant research and increased efforts to educate consumers and health professionals about tobacco and health. CONCLUSIONS: The council recommends the following: (a) that cessation of tobacco use should be the goal for all tobacco users; (b) that the American Medical Association continue to support FDA authority over tobacco products, and FDA classification of nicotine as a drug and tobacco products as drug-delivery devices; (c) that research be encouraged on cigarette modifications that may result in less addicting cigarettes; (d) that the FDA require that the addictiveness of cigarettes be reduced within 5-10 years; (e) expanded surveillance to monitor trends in the use of tobacco products and other nicotine-containing products; (f) expanded access to smoking cessation treatment, and strengthening of the treatment infrastructure; and (g) more accurate labelling of tobacco products, including a more meaningful and understandable indication of nicotine content.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

STUDY SELECTION: All available articles and reports published since 1970 related to cigarette consumption and production waste were reviewed. DATA SOURCES: Global cigarette consumption data were used to estimate cigarette butt and packaging waste quantities. Data from the Center for Marine Conservation's International Coastal Cleanup Project were used to describe some environmental impacts of tobacco-related trash. Data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Toxics Release Inventory and reported global cigarette consumption totals were used to estimate waste production from cigarette manufacturing. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: In 1995, an estimated 5.535 trillion cigarettes (27,675 million cartons and 276,753 million packages) were sold by the tobacco industry globally. Some of the wastes from these products were properly deposited, but a large amount of tobacco consumption waste ends up in the environment. Some is recovered during environmental clean-up days. For the past eight years (1990-1997), cigarette butts have been the leading item found during the International Coastal Cleanup Project; they accounted for 19.1% of all items collected in 1997. The tobacco manufacturing process produces liquid, solid, and airborne waste. Among those wastes, some materials, including nicotine, are designated by the EPA as Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) chemicals. These are possible environmental health hazards. In 1995, the global tobacco industry produced an estimated 2262 million kilograms of manufacturing waste and 209 million kilograms of chemical waste. In addition, total nicotine waste produced in the manufacture of reduced nicotine cigarettes was estimated at 300 million kilograms. CONCLUSIONS: Laws against littering relative to cigarette butts could be better enforced. Additional taxes might be levied on cigarette products that would then be directed to environmental clean-up efforts. The tobacco industry should improve the biodegradability of filters, reduce packaging waste, and educate its customers. Worksites and public buildings should be encouraged or required to supply appropriate disposal mechanisms at all building entrances. Public awareness campaigns about the magnitude and prevention of cigarette consumption waste could be developed through partnerships among environmental groups, health organisations, and environmental protection agencies. Tobacco production waste should be a source of concern and regulation by governments throughout the world; it contains numerous chemicals which may be considered health hazards, not the least of which is nicotine produced in the manufacture of low-nicotine cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This report considers these issues and their relation to public health. In particular, we argue that further reductions in tar and nicotine yields as measured by the International Standards Organisation/Federal Trade Commission (ISO/FTC) method will be largely cosmetic and certainly misleading to consumers. If a new directive uses the ISO/FTC methodology as a basis for regulation, it risks lending further official support to the concept of ""low tar"" cigarettes, which may be used by smokers as an alternative to smoking cessation. Although new regulations based on the ISO/FTC methodology may appear to offer health gains, these will be illusory and there may even be negative health consequences, as has been the case with these tests up to the present. We therefore make the following recommendations for the way forward.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of cytisinicline versus placebo for cessation among smokers with and without COPD. METHODS: This post hoc analysis used combined data from the phase 3 ORCA-2 (Ongoing Research of Cytisinicline for Addiction) and ORCA-3 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Participants received 6 or 12 weeks of cytisinicline or placebo. Of 1602 participants, 145 (9.3%) self-reported COPD. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received 3 mg of cytisinicline three times daily (6 weeks: n=532; 12 weeks: n=534) or placebo (12 weeks: n=536), plus behavioural support. OUTCOME: Biochemically verified continuous smoking abstinence during the last 4 treatment weeks. RESULTS: COPD participants were older, smoked longer and had greater nicotine dependence. Cytisinicline was associated with significantly higher smoking abstinence compared with placebo in both COPD and non-COPD subgroups. There was no statistical evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect between arms. In the 6-week arm, quit estimates were 17.3% versus 2.1% (OR 9.7, p=0.03) for COPD and 19.3% versus 5.5% (OR 4.1, p<0.0001) for non-COPD. In the 12-week arm, quit estimates were 19.1% versus 4.3% (OR 5.3, p=0.04) for COPD and 32.6% versus 8.6% (OR 5.2, p<0.0001) for non-COPD. Cytisinicline was well tolerated with no serious treatment-related events. CONCLUSION: Cytisinicline significantly increased quitting for smokers with and without COPD and was well tolerated.

A study was undertaken to compare a 12-week standard regimen of varenicline with a 10-week standard regimen of transdermal nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation. METHODS: In this 52-week, open-label, randomised, multicentre, phase 3 trial conducted in Belgium, France, The Netherlands, UK and USA, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive varenicline uptitrated to 1 mg twice daily for 12 weeks or transdermal NRT (21 mg/day reducing to 7 mg/day) for 10 weeks. Non-treatment follow-up continued to week 52. The primary outcome was the biochemically confirmed (exhaled carbon monoxide < or = 10 ppm) self-reported continuous abstinence rate (CAR) for the last 4 weeks of the treatment period in participants who had taken at least one dose of treatment. Secondary outcomes included CAR from the last 4 weeks of treatment through weeks 24 and 52, and measures of craving, withdrawal and smoking satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 376 and 370 participants assigned to varenicline and NRT, respectively, were eligible for analysis. The CAR for the last 4 weeks of treatment was significantly greater for varenicline (55.9%) than NRT (43.2%; OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.28, p<0.001). The week 52 CAR (NRT, weeks 8-52; varenicline, weeks 9-52) was 26.1% for varenicline and 20.3% for NRT (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.99, p = 0.056). Varenicline significantly reduced craving (p<0.001), withdrawal symptoms (p<0.001) and smoking satisfaction (p<0.001) compared with NRT. The most frequent adverse event was nausea (varenicline, 37.2%; NRT, 9.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this trial established that abstinence from smoking was greater and craving, withdrawal symptoms and smoking satisfaction were less at the end of treatment with varenicline than with transdermal NRT.

Major tobacco companies favour the ban being overturned. This study aims to explore compliance with the current ban on snus sales and examines the conduct of online snus vendors, including their compliance with two other EU Directives on excise and tobacco advertising and Swedish legislation banning sales of snus outside Sweden. METHODS: To determine who is currently distributing snus via the internet in the EU, searches were carried out in Google, followed by searches in the WHOIS and Amadeus databases. Five online test purchases of snus were made in each of 10 EU Member States using a standardised protocol. Feedback from the test purchases and further analysis of the websites accessed for test purchases were used to critically examine snus retailers' conduct. RESULTS: The majority of online vendors operate from Sweden and target non-Swedish EU citizens. Test purchases were successfully made in all 10 EU Member States; of 43 orders placed, only two failed. Age verification relied only on self-report. The majority of sales applied Swedish taxes, contrary to EU requirements. Copious sales promotion activities, many price based, are incorporated in these websites contravening the EU regulation, and three test purchases were delivered with gifts. CONCLUSIONS: Snus is currently being sold on the single market via the internet in contravention of Swedish legislation and three EU Directives. The apparent willingness of the tobacco industry to contravene EU and Swedish legislation and profit from unlawful sales raises questions about their status as stakeholders in consultations on future policy developments. The findings highlight how national and regional tobacco control legislation can be undermined in an increasingly globalised world.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

There are several pitfalls in this area, including the long time lag before health impacts of product regulatory changes become apparent, the danger of consumers deriving false reassurance of lesser harm in the interim period, the lack of relevant expertise and the lack of an internationally agreed and evidence-based strategic approach. Articles 9 and 10 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control provide the potential for such a global strategy, and knowledge and research has increased significantly over recent years. However, there are huge opportunity costs in implementing product disclosure and regulatory strategies: most national regulators have very limited human and financial resources, which should be focused on other evidence-based tobacco control interventions. We believe therefore that it is now time to abandon the notion of safe or safer cigarettes while moving consumers towards cleaner nicotine products as soon as possible. In parallel to this, we recommend a number of other strategies be implemented including: reducing the appeal of all tobacco products, forbidding new tobacco products or brand variants being marketed without evidence of reduced harm, appeal or addictiveness, and developing a tobacco industry resourced, but industry independent, Framework Convention on Tobacco Control global repository to assist national regulators in understanding and regulating the products on their markets.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Smoked forms of tobacco such as cigars, bidis, kreteks and waterpipes have high popularity and are often perceived erroneously as less hazardous than cigarettes, when in fact their health burden is similar. Smokeless tobacco products vary widely around the world in form and the health hazards they present, with some clearly toxic forms (eg, in South Asia) and some forms with far fewer hazards (eg, in Sweden). Nicotine delivery systems not directly reliant on tobacco are also emerging (eg, electronic nicotine delivery systems). The presence of such products presents challenges and opportunities for public health. Future regulatory actions such as expansion of smoke-free environments, product health warnings and taxation may serve to increase or decrease the use of non-cigarette forms of tobacco. These regulations may also bring about changes in non-cigarette tobacco products themselves that could impact public health by affecting attractiveness and/or toxicity.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: The authors surveyed opinions among adult smokers in two survey waves (N=1376 and N=923) from the New Zealand arm of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Survey during 2007-2009. The authors report prevalence of support stratified by age, gender and ethnicity. The authors carried out multivariate analyses to identify significant associations among potential determinants (demographics, socioeconomic status, mental health and smoking-related beliefs and behaviours) of support. RESULTS: Most New Zealand smokers supported greater regulation of the tobacco industry (65%) and more government action on tobacco (59%). Around half (46%) supported banning sales of cigarettes in 10 years time, provided effective nicotine substitutes were available. In a fully adjusted model, significant associations with support for greater tobacco company regulation included Māori ethnicity, experience of financial stress and greater awareness about the harms of smoking. Significant associations with support for a ban on tobacco sales in 10 years time included increasing area-based deprivation level, increasing intention to quit and greater concern about the health effects of smoking. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that most smokers will support stronger government action to control the tobacco industry and that many support radical 'endgame' approaches. Greater support among Māori, more deprived and possibly Pacific smokers, is an important finding, which could inform the design and implementation of new policies given the very high smoking prevalence among these groups and hence high priority for targeted tobacco control interventions. Perceived difficulties in gaining public support should not impede the introduction of rigorous tobacco control measures needed to achieve a tobacco-free New Zealand.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

There is a marked difference in smoking patterns around the world, driven by initiation rates. While a number of high-income countries have seen smoking prevalence decline markedly from peak, many low-income and middle-income countries appear to still be on an upward trend. Unlike cessation where changes are limited by nicotine dependence, rates of smoking initiation can change rapidly over a short time span. Interventions that can be effective in achieving this include increases in the price of tobacco products, mass media anti-smoking advertising, smoke-free policies, smoking curricula in schools, restrictions on marketing opportunities for the tobacco industry as well as social norms that lead to restrictions on adolescents' ability to purchase cigarettes. Comprehensive tobacco control programmes that aim to denormalise smoking behaviour in the community contain all of these interventions. Rapid reductions in smoking initiation in adolescents have been documented in two case studies of comprehensive tobacco control programmes in California and Australia. Consistent and inescapable messages from multiple sources appear to be key to success. However, the California experience indicates that the rapid decline in adolescent smoking will not continue if tobacco control expenditures and the relative price of cigarettes are reduced. These case studies provide strong additional evidence of the importance of countries implementing the provisions of the Framework Treaty on Tobacco Control.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, little is known about the awareness, perceptions and use of snus among young adults after Camel and Marlboro snus were sold nationwide in 2010. METHODS: Data were collected from 2607 young adults (ages 20-28) who participated in the Minnesota Adolescent Community Cohort Study in 2010-2011. Data include awareness of snus, ever and past 30-day use, perceived potential of snus as a quit aid, and perceived harmfulness and addictiveness of snus relative to cigarettes. The authors assessed the associations between these outcome variables and socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 64.8% of participants were aware of snus, 14.5% ever used snus and 3.2% used snus in the past 30 days. Men and participants who smoked >100 cigarettes in their lifetime were associated with these three outcomes (p<0.05). Among those who were aware of snus, 16.3% agreed snus can help people quit smoking, 17.3% agreed snus is less harmful than cigarettes and 11.3% agreed snus is less addictive than cigarettes. These perceptions were associated with ever use and the past 30-day use of snus (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this regional sample of US young adults, the majority of young adults were aware of snus, and over one in 10 had used snus. More young adults in the sample than the overall US adult population believed that snus is less harmful than cigarettes. Perceptions of snus are associated with snus use. Strategic health communication interventions targeting young adults to confront the positive perceptions associated with snus may be needed to curb the interest in snus.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

The possible role of the China National Tobacco Corporation in the world tobacco market is also discussed. In addition, in the past decade there was an increase in tobacco companies' investment in non-cigarette forms of nicotine delivery.

METHOD: The yields of selected toxicants in the mainstream smoke emissions of six brands of super slim cigarettes were compared with the Canadian Benchmark, which represents the cigarette designs most commonly found in Canada. A super slim cigarette was also compared with a 'Reference Cigarette' to study the impact of the significantly reduced circumference on mainstream smoke emissions. RESULTS: Compared with the Canadian Benchmark, the yields of carbon monoxide, the carbonyls, volatiles and the aromatic amines were significantly lower for the super slim cigarette, but the yields of formaldehyde and ammonia were significantly higher. For brands containing a mixed tobacco blend, the yields of tobacco-specific nitrosamines were increased significantly. The reduced circumference of the super slim cigarette resulted in a lower tobacco weight, which together with filter ventilation resulted in lower yields of many toxicants. However, the reduced circumference increased significantly the yields of formaldehyde and phenols in mainstream smoke emissions. CONCLUSIONS: The notably slimmer design of the super slim cigarette resulted in lower yields of some toxicants in the mainstream smoke emissions. However, there were also significant increases in some toxicant levels in the mainstream smoke emissions including formaldehyde, ammonia and the phenols. There are no changes in emission levels that have been shown to reduce exposure or risk in a way that is meaningful, and therefore, the super slim cigarette should not be considered a 'less harmful' cigarette.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

To inform development of future ST counter-marketing approaches, this qualitative study examined consumer perceptions of traditional and novel ST products and packaging. METHODS: Focus groups and qualitative interviews were held with adolescent (n=23; mean age of 17 years) and adult (n=38; mean age of 29 years) male ST users from rural Ohio counties. Participants were shown a variety of traditional (eg, Copenhagen, Timber Wolf) and novel (eg, Camel Snus, Orbs) ST products and asked about perceptions of these products and their packaging. Transcriptions were coded independently for common themes by two individuals. FINDINGS: Adolescents and adults generally had similar beliefs and reactions about ST products. While participants were familiar with a variety of traditional ST products, Copenhagen was the most frequently used product. Perceptions of quality and price of traditional products were closely tied to product taste and packaging material. Colours, design and size of ST packaging appealed to participants and influenced decisions to purchase. Adults believed novel ST products had a weak taste and were targeted at untraditional ST users. While the vast majority was unfamiliar with dissolvable tobacco, adolescents noted that they would be more convenient to use during school than traditional ST. CONCLUSIONS: Packaging has a significant role in shaping perceptions of ST and consumer behaviour. Regulation of product packaging such as shape, size and images should be part of comprehensive tobacco control.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

ENDS samples were evaluated for design features, including nicotine and glycols content. This could be useful in developing a legal framework to handle ENDS. METHODS: Identification of the nicotine, glycerol and propylene glycol (PPG) contents was conducted using gas chromatography mass spectrometry with quantification performed using flame ionisation techniques. RESULTS: Varying nicotine amounts were found in ENDS cartridges which were labelled with the same concentration. Chemicals such as PPG and glycerol were found to be present in the nicotine-containing liquid of the cartridges. ENDS varied in their contents and packaging information. Limited information was available on the contents of nicotine and other chemicals present in a variety of ENDS sampled. CONCLUSIONS: Based on samples tested in this study, many contain misleading information on product ingredients. The results show poor consistency between actual nicotine content analysed on ENDS cartridges and the amount labelled. These findings raise safety and efficacy concerns for current and would-be recreational users or those trying to quit smoking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Between 1990 and 2010, the tobacco industry-funded extensive academic research on TSNAs in Germany. The objective was to gain better knowledge of how industry aims and strategies correlate with contents of publications by German toxicologists accepting tobacco industry funding by focusing on one prominent such toxicologist. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The authors analysed previously secret tobacco industry documents that were disclosed following a series of litigation cases in the USA and compared them with peer-reviewed published results of tobacco industry-funded toxicologists. The tobacco industry, in particular Philip Morris, developed sophisticated strategies to downplay TSNA's carcinogenic potential. Over 2 decades, German toxicologist Elmar Richter, faculty member of the renowned Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, received substantial financial support from the tobacco industry. Numerous publications show that his research findings supported the aims of the tobacco industry. In his commissioned work, he suggested that TSNA burden can be explained by misclassification of smokers or assay background levels caused by TSNA-like molecules from food. Other publications cast doubt on the relevance of animal testing for TSNAs to humans claiming a detoxifying effect of nicotine on the metabolism of TSNAs or suggesting that adducts of TSNAs are unsuitable as biomarkers of exposure to tobacco smoke. CONCLUSIONS: Economic interests of the tobacco industry have strongly influenced the research activity of Richter and his group. The publications of his working group about carcinogenic effects of TSNAs published between 1992 and 2009 should therefore not be regarded as independent. Scientists and policy makers should consider the long-standing and intensive inter-relation between certain toxicologists and the tobacco industry when assessing the research results and consider ignoring them.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study tested potential countermarketing messages to discourage current and former smokers from becoming dual users of smokeless tobacco and cigarettes. METHODS: In a pretest-post-test experiment, 1836 adult current and recently former smokers from a national sample were randomised to view one of six antismokeless tobacco ads followed by a snus ad, to view a control ad followed by a snus ad; or to view two control ads. Perceived effectiveness of ads and actual changes in attitudes and openness to snus were compared across groups using analyses of variance. RESULTS: Some ads that were perceived as most effective did not change attitudes or openness to trying snus, and conversely, some ads not perceived as effective changed attitudes and openness to snus. Ads portraying the negative health effects of smokeless tobacco were perceived as most effective, but ads with antitobacco industry themes significantly decreased favourable attitudes toward snus. Responses to ads were different for smokers who had ever used smokeless tobacco: for this group health effects and humorous/testimonial ads were effective. CONCLUSIONS: Measures of perceived effectiveness of antitobacco ads need to be augmented with measures of actual effectiveness to assess countermarketing messages. Some of the developed ads, such as ads with anti-industry themes, were effective for the overall population of smokers whereas humorous/testimonial and health effects ads were particularly effective in changing attitudes of past users of smokeless tobacco.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, little research has explored what product features are driving SLT growth, despite awareness that product-level factors may be important in SLT use. This study analyses national sales data to better understand the impact of product features on SLT sales. METHODS: Data on sales of SLT in US convenience stores from 2005 to 2011 were obtained from Nielsen Research Company. Each listed product was coded for attributes such as type, brand, flavouring and form to calculate their respective total sales, market share and contribution to overall SLT growth. RESULTS: Sales of moist snuff products (including snus) increased by 65.6% between 2005 and 2011. Sales of pouched and flavoured forms of moist snuff increased by 333.8% and 72.1%, respectively, and contributed to 28% and 59.4% of the total growth in the moist snuff category, respectively. Value/discount brands accounted for 42% of moist snuff sales in 2011 among the top 10 selling brands, largely driven by Grizzly. After 2 years on the national market, Camel Snus was also one of the top 10 selling moist snuff brands. CONCLUSIONS: Sales of moist snuff, both overall and for particular styles, are increasing. Growing pouch use may be attributed to new SLT users, which may include cigarette smokers using them as starter SLT products. Increased sales of flavoured and discounted snuff raise concerns about use and appeal to youth. Continued surveillance of SLT sales trends is warranted.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

One tool that can contribute substantially toward this goal is the authority to establish performance standards for tobacco products. Conjointly with reducing levels of nicotine in cigarettes, performance and quality control standards need to be established for non-combusted tobacco products.

The authors explore these tradeoffs through a lens of health justice, paying particular attention to the potential impact on vulnerable populations. The ethical tradeoffs explored include the charge that heavy regulation is paternalistic; the potentially regressive impact of heavily taxing a product consumed disproportionately by the poor; the simple loss of enjoyment to heavily addicted smokers; the health risks posed by, for example, regulating nicotine content in cigarettes--where doing so leads to increased consumption. Turning to legalistic concerns, the authors explore whether endgame strategies constitute a form of 'regulatory taking'; whether endgame strategies can be squared with global trade/investment laws; whether free speech rights are infringed by aggressive restrictions on the advertisement and marketing of cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

A possible target would be to effectively eliminate use of the most harmful forms of nicotine within the next decade and then turn our focus to a long-term strategy for the low-harm forms. This paper focuses on the administrative framework(s) needed to accomplish these twin tasks. For a phase-out taking a long time and/or for dealing with residually net harmful and addictive products, there are severe limitations to allowing for-profit marketing of tobacco because such an arrangement (the current one in most countries) can markedly slow down progress and because of the difficulty of constraining marketing in ways that minimise undesirable use. A harm reduction model where the marketing is under the control of a non-profit entity (a regulated market) is required to curtail the incredible power of for-profit marketing and to allow tobacco marketing to be done in ways that further the goal of minimising tobacco-related harm. Countries with a nationalised industry can move their industry onto a harm minimisation framework if they have the political will. Countries with a for-profit industry should consider whether the time and effort required to reconstruct the market may, in the longer term, facilitate achieving their policy goals.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Although several international studies have evaluated the status of tobacco control in this region, the findings have not been integrated with knowledge on domestic activities at the national and municipal levels. We analysed the current tobacco control situation in three East Asian countries, Japan, China and the Republic of Korea, using both international and domestic data sources. We collected data between 2008 and 2011 in each country according to the framework of WHO's MPOWER (Monitoring, Protect, Offer, Warn, Enforcement and Raise) approach for guiding implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Analysis revealed that 37-53% of adult men were current smokers and that smoking prevalence among middle-aged men reached 63%. Less than 20% of male smokers plan to quit and the use of nicotine replacement drugs was 14% at maximum. Forty-six percent or more of men and 20% or more of women were exposed to passive smoking at workplaces and at home, respectively. Many tobacco industry activities remain unrestricted and prevalent. Our findings indicate an urgent need for the following set of policies: raise cigarette prices to increase the quit attempt rate, particularly among adult men; develop a multi-component quitting assistance system to provide adequate assistance for smoking cessation; implement effective smoke-free policies in workplaces and public places to reduce exposure to passive smoking; and rebuild the administrative structure to denormalise tobacco industry activities. The importance of these standard approaches should be reaffirmed by all tobacco control policymakers in East Asia.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

In 1994, Benowitz and Henningfield proposed the idea of federal regulation of the nicotine content of cigarettes such that the nicotine content of cigarettes would be reduced over time, resulting in lower intake of nicotine and a lower level of nicotine dependence. When nicotine levels get very low, cigarettes would be much less addictive. As a result, fewer young people who experiment with cigarettes would become addicted adult smokers and previously addicted smokers would find it easier to quit smoking when they attempt to do so. The regulatory authority to promulgate such a public health strategy was provided by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. Although it precludes 'reducing nicotine to zero', the act does not prohibit the Food and Drug Administration from setting standards for cigarette nicotine content that would prevent them from being capable of causing addiction. This paper reviews the assumptions implicit in a nicotine reduction strategy, examines the available data on the feasibility and safety of nicotine reduction, and discusses the public education, surveillance and support services that would be needed for the implementation of such a policy.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Despite this important step, tobacco remains widely available and policy action appears to have stalled. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of 364 smokers and 402 non-smokers aged 18 years and above, who were sampled from a commercial internet panel in January 2013. RESULTS: Six months after the removal of all tobacco products from open display in New Zealand retail outlets, strong support for the new law exists. Although daily smokers were less supportive than other groups, smokers intending to quit within the next 6 months were more likely than not to believe the law would facilitate quitting. Irrespective of their smoking status, respondents supported not selling tobacco products within 500 m of a school, and requiring tobacco retailers to sell nicotine replacement therapy products. CONCLUSIONS: Public support for more progressive 'endgame' retail measures could catalyse policy action which, in turn, could offer greater protection to young people and accelerate declines in smoking prevalence. Mandatory tobacco-free retail zones around schools, and requiring stores selling tobacco to stock cessation products received strong support, even among daily smokers; both measures would reduce youth exposure to tobacco while providing smokers with better access to cessation aids.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

They are currently unregulated as the Food and Drug Administration has yet to assert jurisdiction under its tobacco authority over these products, and a US Court of Appeals held they cannot be regulated as drugs/delivery devices if they are not marketed for a therapeutic purpose. Observation of the current online marketplace suggests ENDS, like some nutraceutical products, are being promoted using affiliate marketing techniques using claims concerning purported health benefits. OBJECTIVE: This study performed a forensic analysis to characterise the relationships between online ENDS affiliate advertisements and ENDS sellers, and evaluated descriptive content on advertisements and websites to inform future policy and regulatory efforts. METHODS: A purposive sampling strategy was used to identify three forms of ENDS advertising. Web proxy software recorded identifiable objects and their ties to each other. Network analysis of these ties followed, as well as analysis of descriptive content on advertisements and websites identified. RESULTS: The forensic analysis included four ENDS advertisements, two linked affiliate websites, and two linked seller websites, and demonstrated a multilevel relationship between advertisements and sellers with multiple layers of redirection. Descriptive analysis indicated that advertisements and affiliates, but not linked sellers, included smoking cessation claims. Results suggest that ENDS sellers may be trying to distance marketing efforts containing unsubstantiated claims from sales. A separate descriptive analysis of 20 ENDS seller web pages indicated that the use of affiliate marketing by sellers may be widespread. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support increased monitoring and regulation of ENDS marketing to prevent deceptive marketing tactics and ensure consumer safety.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

More than one in eight males in the 12th grade are current users of smokeless tobacco. Surveillance data examining nicotine levels of smokeless tobacco subsequent to 2006 have not been reported in the literature. METHODS: Data on nicotine levels and design features (eg, pH, moisture content, leaf cut and flavour) of smokeless tobacco products sold in Massachusetts were obtained from manufacturers between 2003 and 2012. Design features, levels and temporal trends in unionised (free) nicotine and nicotine content of smokeless tobacco products were analysed overall and by manufacturer and product type. RESULTS: The annual total number of moist snuff products increased from 99 in 2003 to 127 in 2012. The annual total number of reported snus products increased from 4 in 2003 to the highest level of 62 in 2011, before decreasing to 26 in 2012. Overall, mean unionised (free) nicotine remained relatively stable (β=0.018 (95% CI -0.014 to 0.050) mg/g dry weight/year) from 2003 to 2012. However, both levels and temporal trends of mean free nicotine varied significantly among manufacturers (p<0.001). Since 2003, the free nicotine content of snus has increased at an overall rate of 0.192 (95% CI 0.138 to 0.246) mg/g dry weight/year, but varied by manufacturer (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The number of smokeless tobacco products increased in the Massachusetts market. Further, mean unionised (free) nicotine levels in smokeless tobacco products of several manufacturers continued to rise despite decreasing levels from other manufacturers. The current success in tobacco control is very likely undermined without government surveillance, regulation and widespread public disclosure of nicotine levels in these products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: A full-service advertising firm was used to collect all online banner/video advertisements occurring in the USA and Canada between 1 April 2012 and 1 April 2013. The advertisement and associated meta-data on brand, date range observed, first market, and spend were downloaded and summarised. Characteristics and themes of advertisements, as well as topic area and target demographics of websites on which advertisements appeared, were also examined. RESULTS: Over a 1-year period, almost $2 million were spent by the e-cigarette and tobacco industries on the placement of their online product advertisements in the USA and Canada. Most was spent promoting two brands: NJOY e-cigarettes and Swedish Snus. There was almost no advertising of cigarettes. About 30% of all advertisements mentioned a price promotion, discount coupon or price break. e-Cigarette advertisements were most likely to feature messages of harm reduction (38%) or use for cessation (21%). Certain brands advertised on websites that contained up to 35% of youth (<18 years) as their audience. CONCLUSIONS: Online banner/video advertising is a tactic used mainly to advertise e-cigarettes and cigars rather than cigarettes, some with unproven claims about benefits to health. Given the reach and accessibility of online advertising to vulnerable populations such as youth and the potential for health claims to be misinterpreted, online advertisements need to be closely monitored.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: We posted jobs to an online crowdsourcing platform to audit 194 Florida licensed tobacco retailers over a 3-week period. During the same period, trained data collectors conducted audits at the same retail locations. Data were collected on cigarette advertising, cigarette promotions and product availability (electronic cigarettes, snus and dissolvables). We compared data collected by crowdsourced workers and trained staff and computed frequencies, percent agreement and inter-rater reliability. Photographs of e-cigarettes and exterior cigarette advertisements submitted by crowdsourced workers were used to validate responses. RESULTS: Inter-rater reliability between crowdsourced and trained data collectors was moderate to high for coding exterior cigarette advertisements, product availability and some tobacco promotions, but poor to fair when coding presence of sales and interior cigarette advertisements. Photos submitted by crowdsourced workers confirmed e-cigarette availability that was missed by trained data collectors in three stores. CONCLUSIONS: Crowdsourcing may be a promising form of data collection for some POS tobacco measures. Future studies should examine the cost-effectiveness of crowdsourcing compared with traditional trained data collectors and assess which POS measures are most amenable to crowdsourcing.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Literature searches were conducted through December 2013. Studies were included in this review if they related to the environmental impacts of e-cigarettes. RESULTS: Scientific information on the environmental impacts of e-cigarette manufacturing, use and disposal is very limited. No studies formally evaluated the environmental impacts of the manufacturing process or disposal of components, including batteries. Four studies evaluated potential exposure to secondhand e-cigarette aerosol, an indication of impacts on indoor air quality. A 2010 survey of six e-cigarette models found that none of the products provided disposal instructions for spent cartridges containing nicotine. Notably, some e-cigarette manufacturers claim their e-cigarettes are 'eco-friendly' or 'green', despite the lack of any supporting data or environmental impact studies. Some authors argue that such advertising may boost sales and increase e-cigarette appeal, especially among adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Little is known about the environmental impacts of e-cigarettes, and a number of topics could be further elucidated by additional investigation. These topics include potential environmental impacts related to manufacturing, use and disposal. The environmental impacts of e-cigarette manufacturing will depend upon factory size and the nicotine extracting method used. The environmental impacts of e-cigarette use will include chemical and aerosol exposure in the indoor environment. The environmental impacts of disposal of e-cigarette cartridges (which contain residual nicotine) and disposal of e-cigarettes (which contain batteries) represent yet another environmental concern.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DESIGN: Modelling study using a dynamic population model. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: New Zealand, Māori and non-Māori men and women. INTERVENTIONS: Annual increases in tobacco excise tax of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% (with 10% reflecting the annual increase recently legislated by the New Zealand Government to 2016). RESULTS: With a continued commitment to annual 10% increases in tobacco excise tax, in addition to on-going Quitline and cessation support, New Zealand's smoking prevalence is projected to fall from 15.1% in 2013 to 8.7% (95% uncertainty interval 8.6% to 8.9%) by 2025. This is compared to 9.9% without any further tax rises. With annual tax increases of 20%, the prevalence is projected to fall to 7.6% (7.5% to 7.7%) by 2025. The potential reductions in smoking prevalence are substantial for both Māori and non-Māori populations, although annual tax increases as high as 20% will still only see Māori smoking prevalence in 2025 approaching the non-Māori smoking levels for 2013. Scenario analyses did not suggest that growth of the illicit tobacco market would substantively undermine the impact of tobacco tax rises. Nevertheless, unknown factors such as the gradual denormalisation of smoking and changes to the 'nicotine market' may influence sensitivity to changes in tobacco prices in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Regular increases in tobacco taxation could play an important role in helping to achieve tobacco endgames. However, this modelling in New Zealand suggests that a wider range of tobacco endgame strategies will be needed to achieve a smoke-free goal of less than 5% prevalence for all social groups--a conclusion that could also apply in other countries.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The purpose of this observational study was to investigate the content of direct marketing sent in response to registrations on select industry websites. METHODS: An analysis of 659 tobacco company direct mail marketing pieces received between July 2011 and June 2012 was conducted. Mailings were coded for type and value of tobacco coupons, type of tobacco products promoted with coupons and number and type of giveaways offered. RESULTS: The most common type of mailing was tobacco coupon distribution; 86.5% of the mailings contained at least one coupon. Mailings with coupons had an average estimated coupon value of $4.17. The total coupon value of each mailing varied by the type of coupon offer and product promoted. The Camel and Marlboro coupon mailings heavily promoted snus, with over half of Camel coupon mailings (60.9%) and nearly half (44.8%) of Marlboro coupon mailings promoting snus alone. In addition, 47.9% of Marlboro coupon mailings and 11.4% of Camel mailings promoted snus alongside cigarettes. DISCUSSION: Tobacco companies use direct mail marketing to communicate with consumers and provide valuable tobacco coupons.

METHODS: From March to April 2013, we used two search keywords 'electronic cigarette' (Dian Zi Xiang Yan in Chinese) and 'manufacturer' (Sheng Chan Chang Jia in Chinese) to search e-cigarette manufacturers in China on Alibaba, an internet-based e-commerce business that covers business-to-business online marketplaces, retail and payment platforms, shopping search engine and data-centric cloud computing services. A total of 18 websites of 12 e-cigarette manufacturers in China were analysed by using a coding guide which includes 14 marketing claims. RESULTS: Health-related benefits were claimed most frequently (89%), followed by the claims of no secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure (78%), and utility for smoking cessation (67%). A wide variety of flavours, celebrity endorsements and e-cigarettes specifically for women were presented. None of the websites had any age restriction on access, references to government regulation or lawsuits. Instruction on how to use e-cigarettes was on 17% of the websites. CONCLUSIONS: Better regulation of e-cigarette marketing messages on manufacturers' websites is needed in China. The frequent claims of health benefits, smoking cessation, strategies appealing to youth and women are concerning, especially targeting women. Regulators should prohibit marketing claims of health benefits, no SHS exposure and value for smoking cessation in China until health-related, quality and safety issues have been adequately addressed. To avoid e-cigarette use for initiation to nicotine addiction, messages targeting youth and women should be prohibited.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: We examined the text of 46 bills that define e-cigarettes enacted in 40 states and characterised how e-cigarettes and similar products were defined. RESULTS: States enact laws creating new product categories for e-cigarettes separate from the 'tobacco product' category (eg, 'alternative nicotine product,' 'vapour product,' 'electronic nicotine device'), with four states explicitly excluding e-cigarettes from 'tobacco products.' Twenty-eight states do not include e-cigarettes in their definitions of 'tobacco products' or 'smoking,' eight include e-cigarettes as 'tobacco products,' three include e-cigarettes in 'smoking.' Sixteen states' definitions of e-cigarettes require nicotine, and five states pre-empt more stringent local laws. Tobacco and e-cigarette industry representatives tried to shape laws that benefit their interests. CONCLUSIONS: Definitions separating e-cigarettes from other tobacco products are common. Similar to past 'Trojan horse' policies, e-cigarette policies that initially appear to restrict sales (eg, limit youth access) may actually undermine regulation if they establish local pre-emption or create definitions that divide e-cigarettes from other tobacco products. Comparable issues are raised by the European Union Tobacco Products Directive and e-cigarette regulations in other countries. Policymakers should carefully draft legislation with definitions of e-cigarettes that broadly define the products, do not require nicotine or tobacco, do not pre-empt stronger regulations and explicitly include e-cigarettes in smoke-free and taxation laws.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Data were from the Eurobarometer 385 (V.77.1) survey conducted in 2012 (n=26 566). Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess associations between cigarette design/marketing features with aspects of initial smoking (among current and former smokers), cigarette brand choice and perception of reduced harm of cigarette brands (among current smokers; p<0.05). RESULTS: Respondents aged ≥55 years had lower OR than 15-24-year-olds of reporting initial smoking because of the presence of menthol flavour (adjusted OR (AOR)=0.42; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72) or a specific sweet, fruity or spicy flavour (AOR=0.38; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.73). Females had higher OR than males of reporting initial smoking because of the presence of menthol flavour (AOR=2.89; 95% CI 2.07 to 4.02). Furthermore, female smokers were more likely to choose a cigarette brand based on specific tastes such as menthol or spicy, fruity or sweet flavours (AOR=1.33; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.56), or on the levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide (AOR=1.30; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.52). Characteristics such as light-coloured packaging, the shape and size of cigarettes and the pack, the use of terms in the brand name such as 'silver' or 'blue' or descriptors such as 'natural' or 'organic' were all associated with perceptions of reduced harm among specific demographic groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings call for a stronger regulation of tobacco ingredients, packaging features and other marketing strategies that may increase the attractiveness of tobacco products or promote perceptions of harm reduction.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Tobacco product design features enhance abuse liability by (A) optimising the dynamic delivery of nicotine to central nervous system receptors, and affecting smokers' withdrawal symptoms, mood and behaviour; and (B) effecting conditioned learning, through sensory cues, including aroma, touch and visual stimulation, to create perceptions of pending nicotine reward. This study examines the use of additives called 'pyrazines', which may enhance abuse potential, their introduction in 'lights' and subsequently in the highly market successful Marlboro Lights (Gold) cigarettes and eventually many major brands. METHODS: We conducted internal tobacco industry research using online databases in conjunction with published scientific literature research, based on an iterative feedback process. RESULTS: Tobacco manufacturers developed the use of a range of compounds, including pyrazines, in order to enhance 'light' cigarette products' acceptance and sales. Pyrazines with chemosensory and pharmacological effects were incorporated in the first 'full-flavour, low-tar' product achieving high market success. Such additives may enhance dependence by helping to optimise nicotine delivery and dosing and through cueing and learned behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette additives and ingredients with chemosensory effects that promote addiction by acting synergistically with nicotine, increasing product appeal, easing smoking initiation, discouraging cessation or promoting relapse should be regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. Current models of tobacco abuse liability could be revised to include more explicit roles with regard to non-nicotine constituents that enhance abuse potential.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

The FDA will issue a final rule based on comments and data received from researchers, tobacco companies and the public. We aimed to present data about current smokers' awareness of and attitudes towards potential e-cigarette regulation and various policies in the USA. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online e-cigarette focused survey of 519 adult current smokers in April 2014, before the FDA's proposed rule was announced. Participants were recruited from a private research panel (GFK's Knowledge Networks) designed to be representative of the US population. RESULTS: The majority of respondents (62.5%) did not know that e-cigarettes are unregulated by the FDA but agreed that e-cigarettes should be regulated by the FDA for safety and quality (83.5%), carry warning labels about their potential risks (86.6%) and have the same legal age of sale as other tobacco (87.7%). Support was similarly high among current e-cigarette users. Support was substantial though lower overall for policies to restrict e-cigarette indoor use (41.2%), flavouring (44.3%) and advertising (55.5%), and was negatively associated with current e-cigarette use. CONCLUSIONS: Support for many e-cigarette regulatory policies is strong among smokers, including for policies that the FDA has recently proposed and potential future regulations. States considering indoor e-cigarette restrictions should know that a substantial number of current smokers support such regulations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: A search of YouTube videos using the Mongolian term for 'tobacco', and employing 'relevance' and 'view count' criteria, resulted in a total sample of 120 videos, from which 38 unique videos were coded and analysed. RESULTS: Most videos were antismoking public service announcements; however, analyses of viewing patterns showed that pro-smoking videos accounted for about two-thirds of all views. Pro-smoking videos were also perceived more positively and had a like:dislike ratio of 4.6 compared with 3.5 and 1.5, respectively, for the magic trick and antismoking videos. Although Mongolia prohibits tobacco advertising, 3 of the pro-smoking videos were made by a tobacco company; additionally, 1 pro-smoking video promoted electronic cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: Given the popularity of Mongolian YouTube videos that promote smoking, policy changes are urgently required to control this medium, and more effectively protect youth and young adults from insidious tobacco marketing.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, comparatively little is known of the waterpipe tobacco industry, which TTCs have recently entered. This study aimed to gain an understanding of waterpipe tobacco products and marketing strategies by visiting a waterpipe trade exhibition. METHODS: In April 2014, the first author attended an international waterpipe trade exhibition, recording descriptions of products and collecting all available marketing items. We described the purpose and function of all products, and performed a thematic analysis of messages in marketing material. RESULTS: We classified waterpipe products into four categories and noted product variation within categories. Electronic waterpipe products (which mimic electronic cigarettes) rarely appeared on waterpipe tobacco marketing material, but were displayed just as widely. Claims of reduced harm, safety and quality were paramount on marketing materials, regardless of whether they were promoting consumption products (tobacco, tobacco substitutes), electronic waterpipes or accessories. CONCLUSIONS: Waterpipe products are diverse in nature and are marketed as healthy and safe products. Furthermore, the development of electronic waterpipe products appears to be closely connected with the electronic cigarette industry, rather than the waterpipe tobacco manufacturers. Tobacco control policy must evolve to take account of the vast and expanding array of waterpipe products, and potentially also charcoal products developed for waterpipe smokers. We recommend that tobacco substitutes be classified as tobacco products. Continued surveillance of the waterpipe industry is warranted.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Through the Twitter Firehose, we obtained access to all public tweets posted between 6 December 2012 and 20 June 2013 that contained a keyword suggesting a tobacco-related product or behaviour (eg, cigarette, vaping) in addition to a keyword suggesting a price promotion (eg, coupon, discount). From this data set of 155 249 tweets, we constructed a stratified sampling frame based on the price-related keywords and randomly sampled 5000 tweets (3.2%). Tweets were coded for product type and promotion type. Non-English tweets and tweets unrelated to a tobacco or cessation price promotion were excluded, leaving an analytic sample of 2847 tweets. RESULTS: The majority of tweets (97.0%) mentioned tobacco products while 3% mentioned tobacco cessation products. E-cigarettes were the most frequently mentioned product (90.1%), followed by cigarettes (5.4%). The most common type of price promotion mentioned across all products was a discount. About a third of all e-cigarette-related tweets included a discount code. Banned or restricted price promotions comprised about 3% of cigarette-related tweets. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the vast majority of tweets offering price promotions focus on e-cigarettes. Future studies should examine the extent to which Twitter users, particularly youth, notice or engage with these price promotion tweets.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In the absence of federal regulatory oversight of e-cigarettes, we assessed differences in e-cigarette products and sales practices across these categories. METHODS: Brand websites for top-selling e-cigarette brands from each of these categories were examined in October of 2015 to compare website access restrictions, online sales practices and products sold, including e-cigarette model type (eg, 'cigalike' vs advanced systems) and options available (eg, flavoured, nicotine free). RESULTS: Website access to brands developed by cigarette manufacturers was restricted to users aged 21 years or older, and one website required user registration. In addition, these brands were exclusively reusable/rechargeable 'cigalikes.' Limited flavour options were available for these products, and nicotine-free options were not sold. In contrast, brands acquired by cigarette manufacturers and brands with no cigarette manufacturer affiliation generally required website visitors to be 18, offered a nicotine-free option, and most offered disposable products and an array of flavoured products (eg, fruit/candy flavours). CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study finds differences in e-cigarette products and sales practices across these three e-cigarette brand categories, with brands developed by cigarette manufacturers adopting a particularly distinctive product and sales strategy. Anticipated regulation of e-cigarettes in the USA may be influencing these product and sales decisions.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This case study can inform future ingredient disclosure regulations, including implementation of Articles 9 and 10 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). METHODS: We analysed documents available at http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu to identify internal communications regarding the design and execution of the MBS and internal studies on the relationship between tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide and smoke constituents and reviewed publications that further evaluated data published as part of the MBS. RESULTS: The companies conducted extensive studies of cigarette design factors and ingredients that significantly impacted the levels of constituents. While this study asserted that by-brand emissions could be estimated reliably from published tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide levels, the tobacco companies were well aware that factors beyond tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide influenced levels of constituents included in the study. This severely limited the potential usefulness of the MBS predictor equations. CONCLUSIONS: Despite promises to provide data that would allow regulators to predict constituent data for all brands on the market, the final MBS results offered no useful predictive information to inform regulators, the scientific community or consumers. When implementing FCTC Articles 9 and 10, regulatory agencies should demand detailed by-brand information on tobacco product constituents and toxin deliveries to users.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Existing antismoking advertisements developed for the general population might be effective in educating young adults in the military. This study evaluated the effects of different themes of existing antismoking advertisements on perceived harm and intentions to use cigarettes and other tobacco products among Air Force trainees. METHODS: In a pretest-post-test experiment, 782 Airmen were randomised to view antismoking advertisements in 1 of 6 conditions: anti-industry, health effects+anti-industry, sexual health, secondhand smoke, environment+anti-industry or control. We assessed the effect of different conditions on changes in perceived harm and intentions to use cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, hookah and cigarillos from pretest to post-test with multivariable linear regression models (perceived harm) and zero-inflated Poisson regression model (intentions). RESULTS: Antismoking advertisements increased perceived harm of various tobacco products and reduced intentions to use. Advertisements featuring negative effects of tobacco on health and sexual performance coupled with revealing tobacco industry manipulations had the most consistent pattern of effects on perceived harm and intentions. CONCLUSIONS: Antismoking advertisements produced for the general public might also be effective with a young adult military population and could have spillover effects on perceptions of harm and intentions to use other tobacco products besides cigarettes. Existing antismoking advertising may be a cost-effective tool to educate young adults in the military.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

As state and local governments consider regulatory policies, understanding what smokers believe about e-cigarettes and how they value e-cigarettes is important. METHODS: Using data from a convenience sample of Florida adult smokers (N=765), we investigated the value smokers place on specific attributes of e-cigarettes (availability of flavours, effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a cessation aid, healthier alternative to regular cigarettes, ability to use e-cigarettes in public places) by asking smokers how much they would be willing to pay for e-cigarettes with and without each of these attributes. RESULTS: For cigarette-only and dual users, losing the ability to use an e-cigarette as a quit aid and losing the harm reduction of an e-cigarette significantly reduced the price respondents were willing to pay for an e-cigarette. For cigarette-only users, not being able to use an e-cigarette indoors and losing flavours also significantly reduced the price respondents were willing to pay for an e-cigarette. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that smokers value multiple attributes of e-cigarettes. Our valuation measures also appear to align with smokers' beliefs about e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

E-cigarettes triggered much interest in relation to their content and efficacy as smoking cessation tools, but less attention has been paid to users and environmental safety warnings and guidance. Several regulations have been introduced to promote their safe handling and disposal. From May 2016, liquids and cartridges will be regulated by European Community Directives (ECDs) 2001/83/EC and 93/42/EEC, or 2014/40/EU if marketed as tobacco-related products. Currently, manufacturers and distributors must abide by the Chemical (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009 (CHIP) or Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulations (CLP), the latter replacing CHIP in June 2015. OBJECTIVE: In this work, the compliance of marketed e-liquids and e-cigarettes with current European Union and UK legislations is assessed. RESULTS: E-liquids and e-cigarettes (21 and 9 brands, respectively) were evaluated. Evidence of non-compliance was found in relation to the CHIP/CLP toxic (13%) and environmental (37%) pictograms, tactile warning (23%), nominal amount of solution (30%), supplier contact telephone number and address (40%). None of the evaluated e-cigarettes displayed information on the correct disposal/recycling of batteries in line with the ECD 2006/66/EC. CONCLUSIONS: More stringent enforcement of regulations is needed to ensure not only the user's safety and awareness, but also the safeguarding of the environment.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: We examined 6029 quitline callers aged ≥18 years who smoked cigarettes at registration, and completed ≥1 counselling calls, baseline ENDS use questions and a 6-month follow-up survey (response rate: 52.4%). 30-day point prevalence smoking quit rates (PPQRs) were assessed at 6-month follow-up (ENDS-only users were considered quit). Data were weighted for non-response bias. Logistic regression analyses controlled for participant characteristics and programme engagement. RESULTS: At registration, 13.8% of respondents used ENDS (7.9% to quit smoking, 5.9% for other reasons). 30-day PPQRs were: 55.1% for callers using ENDS to quit, 43.1% for callers using ENDS for other reasons, and 50.8% for callers not using ENDS at registration. Callers using ENDS for other reasons were less likely to quit than other groups (adjusted ORs=0.65-0.77); quit rates did not significantly differ between non-ENDS users and those using ENDS to quit. Among callers using ENDS to quit at baseline, 40% used ENDS regularly at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: ENDS users not using ENDS to quit smoking were less successful at quitting at 6-month follow-up compared with callers using ENDS to quit smoking and callers who did not use ENDS at programme registration. Incorporating reasons for ENDS use may be important for future studies examining the role of ENDS in tobacco cessation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

DESIGN: A 2-group randomised controlled trial assessed the net benefit of adding a Tweet2Quit support group to a usual care control condition of nicotine patches and a cessation website. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 160 smokers (4 cohorts of 40/cohort), aged 18-59 years, who intended to quit smoking, used Facebook daily, texted weekly, and had mobile phones with unlimited texting. INTERVENTION: All participants received 56 days of nicotine patches, emails with links to the smokefree.gov cessation website, and instructions to set a quit date within 7 days. Additionally, Tweet2Quit participants were enrolled in 20-person, 100-day Twitter groups, and received daily discussion topics via Twitter, and daily engagement feedback via text. MEASURES: The primary outcome was sustained abstinence at 7, 30 and 60 days post-quit date. RESULTS: Participants (mean age 35.7 years, 26.3% male, 31.2% college degree, 88.7% Caucasian) averaged 18.0 (SD=8.2) cigarettes per day and 16.8 (SD=9.8) years of smoking. Participants randomised to Tweet2Quit averaged 58.8 tweets/participant and the average tweeting duration was 47.4 days/participant. Tweet2Quit doubled sustained abstinence out to 60 days follow-up (40.0%, 26/65) versus control (20.0%, 14/70), OR=2.67, CI 1.19 to 5.99, p=0.017. Tweeting via phone predicted tweet volume, and tweet volume predicted sustained abstinence (p<0.001). The daily autocommunications caused tweeting spikes accounting for 24.0% of tweets. CONCLUSIONS: Tweet2Quit was engaging and doubled sustained abstinence. Its low cost and scalability makes it viable as a global cessation treatment.

To better understand the real-world impact of snus on smoking behaviour, a large-scale, long-term clinical trial of naturalistic snus use among smokers is needed. STUDY DESIGN: A nationwide clinical trial compared abstinence outcomes among smokers who were randomised to receive free samples of snus versus not. Participants (N=1236) were recruited throughout the US and assessed for 1 year following a 6-week naturalistic sampling period, with high retention throughout. Primary outcomes included self-reported quit attempts, floating abstinence (any 7-day period of non-smoking) and 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 6 months and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were changes in smoking, motivation and confidence to quit and adverse events. No tobacco industry support was provided. RESULTS: Within snus group, 82% used at least once, and 16% were using regularly at end of sampling period. Compared to control participants, smokers in the snus group were less likely to make any quit attempt (RR=0.83; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.00), and any 24 h quit attempt (RR=0.77; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.95). There were no group differences on any measure of abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of snus in a naturalistic context resulted in minimal uptake, and as a whole, undermined quit attempts and did not increase smoking abstinence. Results do not support the unguided, free provision of snus among smokers not motivated to quit as a means to facilitate quit attempts.

To inform these efforts, we studied public understanding of cigarette smoke constituents. METHODS: We conducted phone surveys with national probability samples of adolescents (n=1125) and adults (n=5014) and an internet survey with a convenience sample of adults (n=4137), all in the USA. We assessed understanding of cigarette smoke constituents in general and of 24 specific constituents. RESULTS: Respondents commonly and incorrectly believed that harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke mostly originate in additives introduced by cigarette manufacturers (43-72%). Almost all participants had heard that nicotine is in cigarette smoke, and many had also heard about carbon monoxide, ammonia, arsenic and formaldehyde. Less than one-quarter had heard of most other listed constituents being in cigarette smoke. Constituents most likely to discourage respondents from wanting to smoke were ammonia, arsenic, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, lead and uranium. Respondents more often reported being discouraged by constituents that they had heard are in cigarette smoke (all p<0.05). Constituents with names that started with a number or ended in 'ene' or 'ine' were less likely to discourage people from wanting to smoke (all p<0.05). DISCUSSION: Many people were unaware that burning the cigarette is the primary source of toxic constituents in cigarette smoke. Constituents that may most discourage cigarette smoking have familiar names, like arsenic and formaldehyde and do not start with a number or end in ene/ine. Our findings may help campaign designers develop constituent messages that discourage smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Although e-cigarettes have been studied on Twitter, few studies have focused on Instagram, despite having 500 million users. Instagram's emphasis on images warranted investigation of e-cigarettes, as past tobacco industry strategies demonstrated that images could be used to mislead in advertisements, or normalise tobacco-related behaviours. Findings should prove informative to tobacco control policies in the future. METHODS: 3 months of publicly available data were collected from Instagram, including images and associated metadata (n=2208). Themes of images were classified as (1) activity, for example, a person blowing vapour; (2) product, for example, a personal photo of an e-cigarette device; (3) advertisement; (4) text, for example, 'meme' or image containing mostly text and (5) other. User endorsement (likes) of each type of image was recorded. Caption text was analysed to explore different trends in vaping and e-cigarette-related text. RESULTS: Analyses found that advertisement-themed images were most common (29%), followed by product (28%), and activity (18%). Likes were more likely to accompany activity and product-themed images compared with advertisement or text-themed images (p<0.01). Vaping-related text greatly outnumbered e-cigarette-related text in the image captions. CONCLUSIONS: Instagram affords its users the ability to post images of e-cigarette-related behaviours and gives advertisers the opportunity to display their product. Future research should incorporate novel data streams to improve public health surveillance, survey development and educational campaigns.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

An analysis of e-cigarette shipping, product and packaging features.","BACKGROUND: The electronic cigarette industry is growing, with youth using e-cigarettes at higher rates than they are using cigarettes, and retail and online sales projected to reach $10 billion in 2017. Minimal regulation of the production and marketing of e-cigarettes exists to date, which has allowed companies to promote unsupported claims. We assessed the shipping, product features and packaging of a wide variety of e-cigarettes purchased online by adults and youth. METHODS: The most popular internet e-cigarette vendors were identified from a larger study of internet tobacco vendors. Between August 2013 and June 2014, adults made 56 purchase attempts from online vendors, and youth made 98 attempts. Packages received were assessed for exterior and internal packaging features, including product information, health warnings and additional materials. RESULTS: We analysed a total of 125 orders featuring 86 unique brands of e-cigarettes. The contents were rarely indicated on package exteriors. Product information came with just 60% of orders and just 38.4% included an instruction manual. Only 44.6% of products included a health warning, and some had unsupported claims, such as lack of secondhand smoke exposure. Additionally, some products were leaking e-liquid and battery fluid on arrival. CONCLUSIONS: A large variety of e-cigarette products are manufactured and marketed to consumers. Many products do not include instructions for use, and unsupported claims are being presented to consumers. Effective federal regulation of the manufacturing, packaging, product information and health claims surrounding e-cigarettes is necessary to ensure consumers are presented with accurate e-cigarette use information.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

No systematic survey has been conducted of state-level activities to regulate the retail environment, thus little is known about what policies are being planned, proposed or implemented. METHODS: This longitudinal study is the first US survey of state tobacco control programmes (TCPs) about retail policy activities. Surveyed in 2012 and 2014, programme managers (n=46) reported activities in multiple domains: e-cigarettes, retailer density and licensing, non-tax price increases, product placement, advertising and promotion, health warnings and other approaches. Policy activities were reported in one of five levels: no formal activity, planning or advocating, policy was proposed, policy was enacted or policy was implemented. Overall and domain-specific activity scores were calculated for each state. RESULTS: The average retail policy activity almost doubled between 2012 and 2014. States with the largest increase in scores included: Minnesota, which established a fee-based tobacco retail licensing system and banned self-service for e-cigarettes and all other tobacco products (OTP); Oregon, Kansas and Maine, all of which banned self-service for OTP; and West Virginia, which banned some types of flavoured OTP. CONCLUSIONS: Retail policy activities in US states increased dramatically in a short time. Given what is known about the impact of the retail environment on tobacco use by youth and adults, state and local TCPs may want diversify policy priorities by implementing retail policies alongside tax and smoke-free air laws.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: National policies regulating e-cigarettes were identified by (1) conducting web searches on Ministry of Health websites, and (2) broad web searches. The mechanisms used to regulate e-cigarettes were classified as new/amended laws, or existing laws. The policy domains identified include restrictions or prohibitions on product: sale, manufacturing, importation, distribution, use, product design including e-liquid ingredients, advertising/promotion/sponsorship, trademarks, and regulation requiring: taxation, health warning labels and child-safety standards. The classification of the policy was reviewed by a country expert. RESULTS: The search identified 68 countries that regulate e-cigarettes: 22 countries regulate e-cigarettes using existing regulations; 25 countries enacted new policies to regulate e-cigarettes; 7 countries made amendments to existing legislation; 14 countries use a combination of new/amended and existing regulation. Common policies include a minimum-age-of-purchase, indoor-use (vape-free public places) bans and marketing restrictions. Few countries are applying a tax to e-cigarettes.

We investigated tobacco manufacturers' use of flavoured additives in ST products, the target audience(s) for flavoured products, and marketing strategies promoting products by emphasising their flavour. METHODS: Qualitative analysis of internal tobacco industry documents triangulated with data from national newspaper articles, trade press and internet. RESULTS: Internally, flavoured products have been consistently associated with young and inexperienced tobacco users. Internal studies confirmed that candy-like sweeter milder flavours (eg, mint, fruit) could increase appeal to starters by evoking a perception of mildness, blinding the strong tobacco taste and unpleasant mouth feel; or by modifying nicotine delivery by affecting product pH. DISCUSSION: Similar to cigarettes, flavoured ST is likely to encourage novices to start using tobacco, and regulations limiting or eliminating flavours in cigarettes should be extended to include flavoured ST products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The variety of medical treatments for smoking cessation has increased, health professionals are encouraged to use them to assist smoking cessation and tobacco dependence is being described as a 'chronic disease'. Some critics suggest that the medicalisation of smoking undermines the tobacco industry's responsibility for the harms of smoking. Others worry that it will lead smokers to deny personal responsibility for cessation, create beliefs in 'magic bullets' for smoking cessation, or erode smokers' confidence in their ability to quit. We argue that the medicalisation of smoking will have limited impact due to the emphasis on population-based interventions in tobacco control, the ambiguous place of nicotine among other drugs and the modest efficacy of current pharmacotherapies. These factors, as well as lay understandings of smoking that emphasise willpower, personal choice and responsibility, have contributed to the limited success of medical approaches to smoking cessation. While the rapid uptake of e-cigarettes in some countries has provided an option for those who reject medical treatments for smoking cessation, current regulatory developments could limit the potential of e-cigarettes to provide non-therapeutic nicotine for those who currently smoke tobacco.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Chinese pharmacist Hon Lik is frequently cited as inventing the modern e-cigarette in 2003. However, tobacco companies have developed electronic nicotine delivery systems since at least 1963. METHODS: We searched the University of California San Francisco Truth (formerly Legacy) Tobacco Industry Documents beginning with the terms 'electric cigarette' and 'electronic cigarettes', 'e-cigarette', 'smokeless cigarettes', 'nicotine aerosol', 'tobacco aerosol', and 'vaping' and then expanded the search using snowball sampling. We focused our analysis on Philip Morris (PM) documents discussing technology that aerosolised a nicotine solution because these devices resembled modern e-cigarettes. Over 1000 documents were reviewed; 40 were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: PM started developing a nicotine aerosol device in 1990 to address the health concerns and decreased social acceptability of smoking that were leading smokers to switch to nicotine replacement therapy. PM had developed a capillary aerosol generator that embodied basic e-cigarette technology in 1994, but in the mid-to-late 1990s focused on applying its aerosol technology to pharmaceutical applications because of uncertainty of how such products might affect potential Food and Drug Administration regulation of tobacco products. In 2001, PM resumed its work on a nicotine aerosol device, and in 2013, NuMark (a division of Altria, PM's parent company) released the MarkTen, a nicotine aerosol device. CONCLUSIONS: Rather than a disruptive technology, PM developed e-cigarette technology to complement, not compete with, conventional cigarettes and evade tobacco control regulations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

As such, it is critical to understand who uses e-cigarettes, how e-cigarettes are used and what types of products are prevalent. This study assesses patterns of current e-cigarette use among daily and non-daily adult users in the 2013-2014 Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. METHODS: We examined the proportion of current adult e-cigarette users (n=3642) reporting infrequent use (use on 'some days' and use on 0-2 of the past 30 days), moderate use (use on 'some days' and use on >2 of the past 30 days) and daily use. We examined demographic characteristics, use of other tobacco products and e-cigarette product characteristics overall and by use category. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) were calculated using Poisson regression to assess correlates of daily e-cigarette use. RESULTS: Among the 5.5% of adult current e-cigarette users in the PATH Study, 42.2% reported infrequent use, 36.5% reported moderate use and 21.3% reported daily use. Cigarette smokers who quit in the past year were more likely to report daily e-cigarette use, compared with current smokers (aPR=3.21, 95% CI=2.75 to 3.76). Those who reported using rechargeable or refillable devices were more likely to report daily use compared with those who did not use these devices (aPR=1.95, 95% CI=1.44 to 2.65 and aPR=2.10, 95% CI=1.75 to 2.52, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of e-cigarette users in this study reported less than daily use. Compared with non-daily use, daily use was associated with being a former smoker; however, cross-sectional data limits our ability to establish the temporality or directionality of such associations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In August 2016, the agency deemed all tobacco products to be under its authority and a more comprehensive flavour ban is under consideration. OBJECTIVES: To determine the scope and scale of alcohol-flavoured tobacco products among cigars & cigarillos, hookahs and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). METHODS: Alcohol-flavoured tobacco products were identified by online search of tobacco purveyors' product lines and via Google search cross-referencing the various tobacco product types versus a list of alcoholic beverage flavours (eg, wine, beer, appletini, margarita). RESULTS: 48 types of alcohol-flavoured tobacco products marketed by 409 tobacco brands were identified. Alcohol flavours included mixed drinks (n=25), spirits (11), liqueurs (7) and wine/beer (5). Sweet and fruity tropical mixed drink flavours were marketed by the most brands: piña colada (96), mojito (66) and margarita (50). Wine flavours were common with 104 brands. Among the tobacco product categories, brands offering alcohol-flavoured e-cigarettes (280) were most numerous, but alcohol-flavoured products were also marketed by cigars & cigarillos (88) and hookah brands (41). Brands by major tobacco companies (eg, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco) were well represented among alcohol-flavoured cigars & cigarillos with five companies offering a total of 17 brands. CONCLUSIONS: The widespread availability of alcohol-flavoured tobacco products illustrates the need to regulate characterising flavours on all tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: We used multiple sources to identify IEV websites, primarily complex search algorithms scanning more than 180 million websites. In 2013, we manually screened 32 446 websites, identifying 980 IEVs, selecting the 281 most popular for content analysis. This methodology yielded 31 239 websites for screening in 2014, identifying 3096 IEVs, with 283 selected for content analysis. RESULTS: The proportion of vendors that sold online-only, with no retail store, dropped significantly from 2013 (74.7%) to 2014 (64.3%) (p<0.01), with a corresponding significant decrease in US-based vendors (71.9% in 2013 and 65% in 2014). Most vendors did little to prevent youth access in either year, with 67.6% in 2013 and 63.2% in 2014 employing no age verification or relying exclusively on strategies that cannot effectively verify age. Effective age verification strategies such as online age verification services (7.1% in 2013 and 8.5% in 2014), driving licences (1.8% in 2013 and 7.4% in 2014, p<0.01) or age verification at delivery (6.4% in 2013 and 8.1% in 2104) were rarely advertised on IEV websites. Nearly all vendors advertised accepting credit cards, and about ¾ shipping via United States Postal Service, similar to the internet cigarette industry prior to federal bans. CONCLUSIONS: The number of IEVs grew sharply from 2013 to 2014, with poor age verification practices. New and expanded regulations for online e-cigarette sales are needed, including strict age and identity verification requirements.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

RESULTS: While the majority of IEVs (71.9%) were US based in 2013, this dropped to 64.3% in 2014 (p<0.01), with IEVs located in at least 38 countries, and 12% providing location indicators reflecting two or more countries, complicating jurisdictional determinations.Reflecting the retail market, IEVs are transitioning from offering disposable and 'cigalike' e-cigarettes to larger tank and ""mod"" systems. Flavored e-cigarettes were available from 85.9% of IEVs in 2014, with fruit and candy flavors being most popular. Most vendors (76.5%) made health claims in 2013, dropping to 43.1% in 2014. Some IEVs featured conflicting claims about whether or not e-cigarettes aid in smoking cessation. There was wide variation in pricing, with e-cigarettes available as inexpensive as one dollar, well within the affordable range for adults and teens.

Previous observational research suggests that such language may be associated with more favourable attitudes and reduced risk perceptions toward these brands compared with others. This study aimed to determine the effects of health-oriented descriptors on smokers' attitude toward the brand, perception of packaging information, comparative harm versus other brands and intention to purchase either combustible cigarettes or e-cigarettes. METHOD: US adult smokers were randomly assigned to view either a health-oriented language package ('100% organic,' 'all natural' or 'no additives'), traditional marketing language package ('fine quality,' 'premium blend' or '100% original') or a no-language package of a combustible cigarette brand (Study 1, n=405) or an e-cigarette brand (Study 2, n=396) in an experimental design. RESULTS: Study 1: Participants in the health-oriented condition reported more favourable perceptions toward the package information, lower comparative harm and higher intention to purchase combustible cigarettes versus the no language control. In addition, participants in the health-oriented condition reported more positive attitude toward the brand and lower comparative harm versus the traditional marketing condition. Study 2: Compared with the traditional marketing condition, participants in the health-oriented condition reported greater intention to purchase Absolute e-cigarettes. There were no significant differences in attitude toward the brand, perception of packaging information and comparative harm versus other brands across conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of health-oriented language was significant for combustible cigarettesand e-cigarette packages. Policies to restrict health-oriented language on cigarette and e-cigarette packaging are recommended.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We sought to identify (a) how vape shops can be identified and (b) sales and marketing practices of vape shops. DATA SOURCES: A medical librarian iteratively developed a search strategy and in February 2017 searched seven academic databases (ABI/INFORM Complete, ECONLit, Embase, Entrepreneurship, PsycINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus). We hand searched Tobacco Regulatory Science and Tobacco Prevention & Cessation. STUDY SELECTION: We used dual, independent screening. Records were eligible if published in 2010 or later, were peer-reviewed journal articles and focused on vape shops. DATA EXTRACTION: We used dual, independent data abstraction and assessed risk of bias. Of the 3605 records identified, 22 were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: We conducted a narrative systematic review. Researchers relied heavily on Yelp to identify vape shops. Vape shop owners use innovative marketing strategies that sometimes diverge from those of traditional tobacco retailers. Vape shop staff believe strongly that their products are effective harm-reduction products. Vape shops were more common in areas with more White residents. CONCLUSIONS: Vape shops represent a new type of retailer for tobacco products. Vape shops have potential to promote e-cigarettes for smoking cessation but also sometimes provide inaccurate information and mislabelled products. Given their spatial patterning, vape shops may perpetuate inequities in tobacco use. The growing literature on vape shops is complicated by researchers using different definitions of vape shops (eg, exclusively selling e-cigarettes vs also selling traditional tobacco products).","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: Analysis of previously secret tobacco industry documents, news archives and Parliamentary debate records. RESULTS: From 1972 to 1991, the British government sought to investigate safer smoking through the 'product modification programme'. The Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health (ISCSH) advised the British government on these efforts and collaborated with the tobacco industry, with which government then negotiated to determine policy. The ISCSH operated from four industry-backed premises, which contributed to the ISCSH's support of safer smoking: (1) reduced toxicity indicates reduced risk; (2) collaboration with the tobacco industry will not undermine tobacco control; (3) nicotine addiction is unavoidable; (4) to curtail cigarette use, solutions must be consumer-approved (ie, profitable). These premises often undermined tobacco control efforts and placed the ISCSH at odds with broader currents in public health. The product modification programme was abandoned in 1991 as the European Community began requiring members to adopt upper tar limits, rendering the ISCSH redundant. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Endorsements of reduced harm tobacco products share the same four premises that supported the product modification programme. Current tobacco harm reduction premises and policies supported by the British government and leading British public health organisations may reflect the historical influence of the tobacco industry.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

We sought to characterise the prevalence and correlates of the incorrect belief that VLNC cigarettes are less carcinogenic than current cigarettes, as this could reduce motivation to quit. METHODS: Participants were a nationally representative sample of 650 adult smokers in the USA. In 2015-2016, before the VLNC proposal became public, these smokers took part in an online survey. We used multivariate weighted analyses to calculate ORs and percentages and a χ2 test to examine the association between variables. RESULTS: Overall, 47.1% of smokers believed that smoking VLNC cigarettes for 30 years would be less likely to cause cancer than smoking current cigarettes. This misperception was more common among smokers who were aged above 55 (56.6%) and black (57.4%). Additionally, 23.9% of smokers reported they would be less likely to quit if the USA adopted a VLNC standard. Thinking that VLNC cigarettes would be less carcinogenic was associated with smokers reporting they would be less likely to quit (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Many smokers had the misperception that smoking VLNC cigarettes is less likely to cause cancer, and some stated that they would be less likely to quit. A VLNC standard may be more effective if accompanied by a communication campaign that emphasises the continued dangers of smoking VLNC cigarettes due to the many toxic chemicals in smoke.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

METHODS: We examined changes in e-cigarette use frequency at Wave 2 among adult e-cigarette users at Wave 1 (unweighted n=2835). Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were calculated using a predicted marginal probability approach to assess correlates of e-cigarette discontinuance and smoking abstinence at Wave 2. RESULTS: Half (48.8%) of adult e-cigarette users at Wave 1 discontinued their use of e-cigarettes at Wave 2. Among dual users of e-cigarettes and cigarettes at Wave 1, 44.3% maintained dual use, 43.5% discontinued e-cigarette use and maintained cigarette smoking and 12.1% discontinued cigarette use at Wave 2, either by abstaining from cigarette smoking only (5.1%) or discontinuing both products (7.0%). Among dual users at Wave 1, daily e-cigarette users were more likely than non-daily users to report smoking abstinence at Wave 2 (aPR=1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.91). Using a customisable device (rather than a non-customisable one) was not significantly related to smoking abstinence at Wave 2 (aPR=1.14, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.60). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that e-cigarette use patterns are highly variable over a 1-year period. This analysis provides the first nationally representative estimates of transitions among US adult e-cigarette users. Future research, including additional waves of the PATH Study, can provide further insight into long-term patterns of e-cigarette use critical to understanding the net population health impact of e-cigarettes in USA.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Their effectiveness has yet to be studied. METHODS: Leading tobacco brands (388) were identified via Nielsen and Ranker databases and 108 were found to maintain brand-sponsored Facebook pages. Key indicators of alignment with Facebook policy were evaluated. RESULTS: Purchase links (eg, 'shop now' button) on brand-sponsored pages were found for hookah tobaccos (41%), e-cigarettes (74%), smokeless (50%) and cigars (31%). Sales promotions (eg, discount coupons) were present in hookah tobacco (48%), e-cigarette (76%) and cigar (69%) brand-sponsored pages. While conventional cigarettes did not maintain brand-sponsored pages, they were featured in 80% of online tobacco vendors' Facebook pages. The requirement for age gating, to exclude those <18 from viewing tobacco promotion, was absent in hookah tobacco (78%), e-cigarette (62%) and cigar (21%) brand-sponsored pages and for 90% of online tobacco stores which promote leading cigarette brands (eg, Marlboro, Camel). Many of the brand-sponsored tobacco product pages had thousands of 'likes'. CONCLUSIONS: It is laudable that Facebook has policies intended to interdict tobacco promotion throughout its platform. Nevertheless, widespread tobacco promotion and sales were found at variance with the company's policies governing advertising, commerce, page content and under age access. Vetting could be improved by automated screening in partnership with human reviewers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study examined the predictors of progression of ND symptoms in adolescent waterpipe smokers. METHODS: We assembled a cohort of Lebanese adolescents enrolled in eighth and ninth grades at baseline, and surveyed them every 6 months over the next 24 months. Progression of ND symptoms was defined as an increase over time in the number of items endorsed on the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist. Predictors included individual (eg, psychological factors, attitudes towards waterpipe, school performance, physical activity) and socioenvironmental (eg, smoking among parents, siblings and close friends; the café environment) attributes. RESULTS: Among 264 adolescent waterpipe smokers (baseline mean age=14.6 years, 50.4% females), 105 (39.7%) progressed on ND symptoms during follow-up. Predictors of progression were higher baseline stress (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.19) and higher self-esteem (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.24). Reporting difficulty refraining from smoking waterpipe while in a restaurant was the strongest predictor of progression (OR 4.04, 95% CI 1.44 to 11.34). Having a mother with ≥12 years of education protected against progression of ND (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of adolescent waterpipe smokers progressed on ND. Venue-based policies such as limiting youth access to waterpipe cafés are warranted.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We examined one of these strategies: to fund and conduct scientific research related to potential benefits of nicotine, and to use their findings to promote nicotine. METHODS: Qualitative analysis of previously secret tobacco industry documents from the Truth (formerly Legacy) Tobacco Documents Library (industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco), triangulated with data from other sources, including the online search engine Google, from the 1970s to December 2017. RESULTS: After publication of the 1988 Surgeon General's report on nicotine addiction, tobacco companies (particularly RJ Reynolds) intensified efforts to promote the benefits of nicotine while downplaying its addictiveness and health risks. Activities included building relationships with academic institutions and funding scientific studies of the benefits of nicotine on cognition and other performance areas through intramural and extramural programmes. Companies then promoted their research findings through public relations campaigns, often minimising nicotine's health risks by comparing it to caffeine or coffee. These comparisons appeared in highly publicised scientific meetings and interviews with the press. Nicotine-positive messages reappeared in the popular press and on some company websites in the 2010s. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco companies implemented strategies to promote benefits of nicotine to scientific and general audiences while minimising its health risks. These strategies reappeared at the time novel tobacco products like electronic cigarettes were introduced. A greater awareness of the source of claims related to purported benefits of nicotine could inform discussions about emerging tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We sought to examine the impact of such marketing claims about potential modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs). METHODS: Participants were national samples of 4797 adults and 969 adolescent US smokers and non-smokers. We provided information about a potential MRTP (heated tobacco product, electronic cigarette or snus). Experiment 1 stated that the MRTP was as harmful as cigarettes or less harmful (lower risk claim). Experiment 2 stated that the MRTP exposed users to a similar quantity of harmful chemicals as cigarettes or to fewer chemicals (lower exposure claim). RESULTS: Claiming lower risk led to lower perceived quantity of chemicals and lower perceived risk among adults and adolescents (all p<0.05, Experiment 1). Among adults, this claim led to higher susceptibility to using the MRTP (p<0.05). Claiming lower exposure led to lower perceived chemical quantity and lower perceived risk (all p<0.05), but had no effect on use susceptibility (Experiment 2). Participants thought that snus exposed users to more chemicals and was less safe to use than heated tobacco products or electronic cigarette MRTPs (Experiments 1 and 2). DISCUSSION: Risk and exposure claims acted similarly on MRTP beliefs. Lower exposure claims misled the public to perceive lower perceived risk even though no lower risk claim was explicitly made, which is impermissible under US law.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

In 2016, Philip Morris International, Inc. (PMI) submitted a modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market IQOS in the USA with claims of reduced exposure and reduced risk. METHODS: We examined PMI's MRTP application, specifically sections on aerosol chemistry and human exposure assessment, to assess the validity of PMI's claims of reduced exposure and risk. FINDINGS: PMI reported levels for only 40 of 93 harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) on FDA's HPHC list in IQOS mainstream aerosol. All substances in PMI's list of 58 constituents (PMI-58) were lower in IQOS emissions compared with mainstream smoke of 3R4F reference cigarettes. However, levels of 56 other constituents, which are not included in the PMI-58 list or FDA's list of HPHCs, were higher in IQOS emissions; 22 were >200% higher and seven were >1000% higher than in 3R4F reference cigarette smoke. PMI's studies also show significantly lower systemic exposure to some HPHCs from use of IQOS compared with smoking combustible cigarettes. CONCLUSION: PMI's data appear to support PMI's claim that IQOS reduces exposure to HPHCs. However, PMI's data also show significantly higher levels of several substances that are not recognised as HPHCs by the FDA in IQOS emissions compared with combustible cigarette smoke. The impact of these substances on the overall toxicity or harm of IQOS is not known.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In December 2016, PMI filed a modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), seeking authorisation to market IQOS in USA with three claims of reduced harm: 'switching completely from conventional cigarettes to the IQOS system…' (1) 'can reduce the risks of tobacco-related diseases;' (2) 'significantly reduce[s] your body's exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals;' and (3) 'presents less risk of harm than continuing to smoke cigarettes.' Consumers may misunderstand what is meant by 'switching completely'. METHODS: We critically reviewed study reports submitted to FDA by PMI in support of proposed marketing claims in its MRTP application for IQOS and focused on the statement that switching completely to IQOS reduces risk. RESULTS: We found deficiencies with evidence provided by PMI supporting their assertions that: current smokers will understand what is meant by the phrase 'switching completely'; the proposed claims will not decrease smokers' intentions to quit; and IQOS users will in fact 'switch completely' from smoking cigarettes to using IQOS. The studies and measurement instruments employed by PMI suffer from design flaws and their reporting of associated findings is misleading. CONCLUSION: Consumers will not understand the condition of the claims-that they must quit using cigarettes completely to achieve the inferred health benefits of IQOS. Rather, they are likely to misunderstand the unsupported claims of reduced risks to mean IQOS are harm-free.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Yet, little controlled study has determined the degree to which actual perceptions are based on the cigarette's tobacco constituents in the absence of knowledge about the brand's identity. METHODS: 194 adult dependent smokers rated their perceptions on 'liking', 'satisfying', 'strong' and perceived amount of 'nicotine' after smoking ad lib one of their preferred brands of cigarettes. All did so either when blinded (n=118) or unblinded (n=76) to the brand they were given, with the blinding conditions from separate studies. These between-groups secondary analyses determined differences in perceptions based on blinding to brand, controlling for age and cigarettes/day. RESULTS: All perceptions were lower for those smoking own brand under blinded versus unblinded conditions, as hypothesised. Consistent with lowered perceptions for smoking one's own brand obtained from the 118 blinded to brand, their 'somewhat' ratings for a 'how similar to own brand' item indicated uncertainty, just mid-way between 'not at all' and 'very much' on the 0-100 visual analogue scale. (The 76 unblinded were already informed it was their own brand.) CONCLUSIONS: Acute perceptions of one's own cigarette are substantially lower when smokers are simply unaware of brand, relative to those aware it is their preferred brand. Results support the notion that perceptions of smoking own brand are enhanced by marketing efforts to associate brands with expectations of pleasurable subjective effects, beyond the impact due solely to the cigarette's manufactured product constituents.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

To monitor the use of IQOS among young Korean adults, we identified their awareness, experience and current use of IQOS. METHODS: Three months after the introduction of IQOS in Korea, we conducted an online survey with 228 general young adults, aged 19-24 years. RESULTS: 87 participants (38.1%) were aware of IQOS, 13 (5.7%) were IQOS ever users and 8 (3.5%) were current IQOS users. All the current IQOS users were triple users of conventional cigarettes and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). There were no IQOS-only users and one IQOS ever user was a non-cigarette smoker. Among the eight current IQOS users who smoked 9.1 conventional cigarettes a day on average, four smoked 10-20 HEETS sticks a day. The current IQOS users decided to use IQOS because they believed it was less harmful or to stop smoking. The current conventional cigarette smokers were much more likely to be aware of IQOS (OR 4.496; 95% CI 2.185 to 9.250) and to be IQOS ever users (OR 11.649; 95% CI 1.024 to 132.564). CONCLUSION: Awareness, experience and use of IQOS among young Korean adults were relatively higher than among their Japanese counterparts. Current IQOS users were more likely to smoke conventional cigarettes and/or e-cigarettes, which contradicts the tobacco industry's claims that conventional cigarette smokers will switch to heated tobacco products. Until obtaining robust evidence concerning heated tobacco products, the government should regulate the tobacco industry's marketing tactics and health claims.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched up to 6 November 2017 for studies on HnB published after December 2009; reference lists were screened and other researchers contacted, yielding 637 records. STUDY SELECTION: Thirty-one publications on HnB secondhand emissions (n=16) or use by humans (n=15) were selected by two reviewers with excellent agreement (k=0.75). DATA EXTRACTION: Data on authors' affiliations, HnB products, secondhand emissions and human exposure were extracted by one reviewer. Two reviewers assessed the quality of experimental HnB studies using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool. DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty out of 31 studies were affiliated with tobacco industry. Studies on secondhand emissions varied by methodology, products and comparators. Compared with cigarettes, HnB delivered up to 83% of nicotine and reduced levels of harmful and potentially harmful toxicants by at least 62% and particulate matter by at least 75%. Experimental HnB use studies were limited to one product, reductions of human exposure to toxicants varied between 42% and 96%. HnB use suppressed urges to smoke, but participants rated HnB less satisfying than cigarettes. While limited by methodological heterogeneity, findings were largely similar for independent and industry-funded studies. CONCLUSIONS: Studies on HnB secondhand emissions and human use were heterogeneous and largely affiliated with the manufacturers. HnB exposed users and bystanders to toxicants, although at substantially lower levels than cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

While the Master Settlement Agreement placed restrictions on the use of cartoons for major cigarette and smokeless (chew) tobacco brands in the USA, no such restrictions exist for electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). Research has shown that e-cigarette manufacturers are using cartoons to market products, but limited data exist on the extent of these practices. This study examined the extent of the use of cartoons to market e-liquids on Instagram. METHODS: Instagram posts with the hashtag #ejuice or #eliquid were collected from 3 November 2017 to 17 November 2017. Rules were established to identify Cartoon (the post contained a cartoon), Logo (the post was labelled a cartoon due to the logo) and Promo (the image of the post or accompanying text indicated it was a promotion) in the data (n=3481). RESULTS: Among all posts, 723 (20.77%) contained a Cartoon, and 479 (13.76%) were coded as a cartoon because of the Logo. In other words, 479/723 or (66.25%) of Cartoon were coded as cartoons due to the vendor's or manufacture's logo. Among all posts, 2360 (67.80%) were Promo. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that e-cigarette companies are using cartoons to market their products and many of these companies' logos are cartoons. Empirical data are needed to determine whether cartoon marketing strategies impact perceived risk and benefits, product appeal, the intention to use and actual use of e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The current paper seeks to build on these studies and provide an updated overview of the characteristics of tobacco industry-sponsored apps. METHODS: In November 2017, we identified 19 unique top-selling cigarette brands, 20 smokeless tobacco brands, 30 e-cigarette brands and 43 cigar brands based on Nielsen sales from 2016 Nielsen Scantrack data and 2016 Kantar advertising data from the Kantar Media Stradegy database. We searched for these brand-sponsored apps in the Google Play and Apple iTunes US online stores. RESULTS: We identified four cigarette and one smokeless tobacco brand-sponsored apps on the Google Play store, but none in the Apple store. The apps sponsored by Grizzly, Newport, Skoal, Camel and Winston used the last four digits of the users' social security number to verify age. The Marlboro app offered another option in addition to providing a partial social security number-providing a valid home address. The main feature of all apps was location-based, time-sensitive coupons. Some apps had additional functions such as additional detailed product information, interactive help menus and games. DISCUSSION: This paper provides an up-to-date description of apps that are sponsored by tobacco companies. Cessation interventions could consider reminding their target audience to delete these apps to support quit attempts.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Understanding what they see when they view smartphone-optimised (mobile) tobacco websites is important, as it can inform tobacco education and cessation strategies. This study describes mobile tobacco websites for leading brands of cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco (smokeless), e-cigarettes and hookah. METHODS: We identified 130 leading tobacco brands based on sales, advertising spending and self-report data. Of these, 62 brands had mobile websites. We conducted an inductive content analysis (ie, where we derived the coding scheme from what we observed) of website characteristics by dual-coding: age requirements, warning display, brand engagement methods (eg, social features) and sales strategies (eg, coupons). RESULTS: All cigarette and most smokeless websites required age-verified accounts for entry, while 76% of e-cigarette websites required accounts only for making purchases. All cigarette and smokeless websites showed warnings, but a minority of e-cigarette and cigar websites did, and no hookah websites did. Many websites required users to scroll up to view warnings. Most e-cigarette websites, most hookah websites, and half of cigar websites linked to multiple social media platforms; however, most cigarette and smokeless websites facilitated socialisation internally. All cigarette, most smokeless and no hookah websites offered coupons. Many cigarette and smokeless coupons were time-sensitive and location-based. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight issues in how tobacco brand websites address youth access, display warnings, engage consumers and facilitate purchase.

The non-tobacco HTP components have escaped effective regulation under many countries' tobacco control laws because they are packaged and sold separately from the tobacco-containing components. In the USA, HTPs cannot be marketed unless the Food and Drug Administration determines that allowing their sale would be 'appropriate for the protection of the public health'. Philip Morris International (PMI) is seeking permission to market its IQOS HTP in the USA with 'modified risk tobacco product' (MRTP) claims that it reduces exposure to harmful substances and is less harmful than other tobacco products. However, PMI has not submitted adequate scientific evidence required by US law to demonstrate that the product is significantly less harmful to users than other tobacco products, that its labelling would not mislead consumers, or that its marketing-with or without MRTP claims-would benefit the health of the population as a whole. Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) must take measures to reduce tobacco use and nicotine addiction, and prevent false or misleading tobacco product labelling, advertising and promotions; the introduction of new HTPs must be assessed according to these goals. All components of HTPs should be regulated at least as stringently as existing tobacco products, including restrictions on labelling, advertising, promotion and sponsorship, sales to minors, price and taxation policies and smokefree measures. There is nothing in US law or the FCTC that prevents authorities from prohibiting HTPs.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

In 2016, Philip Morris International (PMI) applied to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking authorisation to market their IQOS HTP system and flavoured 'HeatSticks' in the USA as a modified-risk tobacco product (MRTP). METHODS: We systematically evaluated the publicly available data PMI submitted to FDA in its MRTP application to determine whether PMI's IQOS product meets the US Tobacco Control Act's standard for MRTP claims. We examined whether PMI provided sufficient data showing tobacco users will not initiate with IQOS, that youth will not misperceive the MRTP-related claims being made concerning IQOS, and how youth perceive health risks associated with IQOS. RESULTS: PMI's own studies failed to provide evidence that youth, including non-users and former users, will not find IQOS appealing, will not initiate use of IQOS and will not perceive these products as risk-free. Further, PMI did not refer to independent studies conducted among adolescents which could influence their conclusions. Finally, their studies suffered from design and implementation flaws and cannot be relied on to support the proffered claims. CONCLUSION: PMI's own data and available evidence from scientific studies conducted independent of the tobacco industry regarding how novel tobacco products are currently being marketed suggest that introduction of IQOS will result in adolescent and young adult non-users initiating tobacco use with IQOS and could also increase poly-use of IQOS along with other tobacco products.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

RESULTS: Only in 17 of 46 country-year cases with adequate data were HTPs less expensive to use than combusted cigarettes over a year. DISCUSSION: The tax advantages being given to HTPs may instead of providing a price signal to a consumer looking to switch, be providing a profit signal to tobacco companies to switch over to selling more HTPs and fewer combusted cigarettes.

It is prefilled with a liquid that is advertised to contain a high concentration of nicotine salt. JUUL commands 50% of the US ECIG market share, and its wide popularity with underage users has triggered unprecedented actions by the US FDA. Apart from its nicotine salt-containing liquid and compact form, a salient advertised design feature is a control circuit that limits the heating coil temperature, presumably reducing unwanted toxicants. In this study, several tobacco-flavoured JUUL devices were reverse engineered, and their aerosol emissions were studied. METHODS: Total nicotine and its partitioning (freebase and protonated), propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin (PG/VG) ratio, and carbonyls were quantified by gas chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The temperature control functionality of JUUL was investigated using a temperature-controlled bath in which the coil was submerged. RESULTS: The liquid nicotine concentration was found to be 69 mg/mL, and the liquid and aerosol PG/VG ratio was found to be 30/70. In 15 puffs, JUUL emitted 2.05 (0.08) mg of nicotine, overwhelmingly in the protonated form. Carbonyl yields were significantly lower than those reported for combustible cigarettes, but similar to other closed-system ECIG devices. The heating coil resistance was 1.6 (0.66) Ohm, while the maximum power delivered by the JUUL device was 8.1 W. The control circuit limited the peak operating temperature to approximately 215C. CONCLUSIONS: JUUL emits a high-nicotine concentration aerosol predominantly in the protonated form. JUUL's nicotine-normalised formaldehyde and total aldehyde yields are lower than other previously studied ECIGs and combustible cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

DATA SOURCES: Adult smokers and vapers (n=12 294) from the 2016 International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey (4CV1). ANALYSIS: Self-reported exposure to cigarette and vaping product advertising through point-of-sale, websites/social media, emails/texts, as well as exposure to and use of price offers were assessed for country differences using logistic regression models adjusted for multiple covariates. RESULTS: Reported exposure to cigarette advertising exposure at point-of-sale was higher in the USA (52.1%) than in AU, Canada and England (10.5%-18.5%). Exposure to cigarette advertising on websites/social media and emails/texts was low overall (1.5%-10.4%). Reported exposure to vaping ads at point-of-sale was higher in England (49.3%) and USA (45.9%) than in Canada (32.5%), but vaping ad exposure on websites/social media in Canada (15.1%) was similar with England (18.4%) and the USA (12.1%). Exposure to vaping ads via emails/texts was low overall (3.1%-9.9%). Exposure to, and use of, cigarette price offers was highest in the USA (34.0 % and 17.8 %, respectively), but the use rate among those exposed was highest in AU (64.9%). Exposure to, and use of, price offers for vaping products was higher in the USA (42.3 % and 21.7 %) than in AU, Canada and England (25.9%-31.5 % and 7.4%-10.3 %). CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of cigarette and vaping product marketing exposure generally reflected country-specific policies, except for online vaping ads. Implications for research and policy are discussed.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study aimed to quantify changes in perceived tobacco accessibility, smoking norms and smoking attitudes among adolescents in Scotland, following the implementation of partial and comprehensive point-of-sale (POS) tobacco display bans. METHODS: From the Determining the Impact of Smoking Point of Sale Legislation Among Youth (DISPLAY) Study's 2013-2017 annual surveys we retrieved data comprising 6202 observations on 4836 12-17-year-old adolescents from four schools. Applying generalised estimating equations, associations between time (postban: 2016-2017 vs preban:2013) and three outcomes were estimated. Outcomes were perceived commercial access to tobacco, perceived positive smoking norm (friends think it's OK to smoke) and positive smoking attitude (you think it's OK to smoke). Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographics, smoking status, family smoking, friend smoking and e-cigarette use. RESULTS: Crude trends showed an increase over time in perceived accessibility, norms and attitudes. However, after adjustment for confounders, mainly e-cigarette use, we found significant declines in perceived access (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.90) and in positive smoking attitude (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.49 to 0.91), but no change in perceived positive smoking norm (OR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.29). Current/past occasional or regular e-cigarette use was associated with higher odds of perceived access (OR = 3.12, 95% CI 2.32 to 4.21), positive norm (OR = 2.94, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.02) and positive attitude (OR = 3.38, 95% CI 2.35 to 4.87). CONCLUSION: Only when taking into account that the use of e-cigarettes increased in 2013-2017 did we find that the POS tobacco display ban in supermarkets and small shops in Scotland was followed by reductions in adolescents' perceived accessibility of tobacco and positive attitudes towards smoking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The campaign included advertisements with fake warnings conveying positive messages, which mimicked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s warning requirements for electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) advertisements that took effect in 2018. We report adolescent males' recall of these fake warnings and how exposure to fake warnings affected recall of other advertisement components, including the actual warning or health risks, brand and product. METHODS: Ohio males ages 12-19 years (N = 775; 73.8 % white non-Hispanic) were randomly assigned to view an e-cigarette advertisement with or without a fake warning. Afterward, they were asked what they remembered most about the advertisement. Responses were qualitatively coded. Statistical analyses included survey-weighted descriptive statistics and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of participants who viewed an e-cigarette advertisement with a fake warning, 27.0 % reported the fake warning was what they remembered most, and 18.8 % repeated the fake warning message. Participants viewing advertisements with a fake warning had lower odds of recalling the actual warning or health risks (OR = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.77) or brand (OR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.85), compared with participants viewing other e-cigarette advertisements. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents viewing an advertisement with a fake warning were less likely to recall the advertisement's actual warning or health risks. Although e-cigarette advertisements now carry large FDA-mandated warnings, this tactic could be used for cigarette advertisements that continue to carry small warnings in the USA. Findings underscore the necessity of tobacco advertisement surveillance and study of advertisements' effects on adolescents.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: We report flavour types among US tobacco users from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, wave 2, 2014-2015. At wave 2, we examined (1) flavour use and type at past 30-day use; (2) new flavoured tobacco product use and type; (3) product-specific flavour patterns across youth (ages 12-17) (n=920), YA (18-24) (n=3726) and adult (25+) (n=10 346) past 30-day and new tobacco users and (4) concordance between self-coded and expert-coded brand flavour type among all adults (18+). RESULTS: Prevalence of flavoured tobacco product use was highest among youth, followed by YA and adult 25+ any tobacco users. Within each age group, flavoured use was greatest among hookah, e-cigarette and snus users. Overall, menthol/mint, fruit and candy/sweet were the most prevalent flavour types at first and past 30-day use across age groups. For past 30-day use, all flavour types except menthol/mint exhibited an inverse age gradient, with more prevalent use among youth and YAs, followed by adults 25+. Prevalence of menthol/mint use was high (over 50% youth, YAs; 76% adults 25+) and exhibited a positive age gradient overall, though the reverse for cigarettes. Brand-categorised and self-reported flavour use measures among adults 18+ were moderately to substantially concordant across most products. CONCLUSIONS: Common flavours like menthol/mint, fruit and candy/sweet enhance appeal to young tobacco users. Information on flavour types used by product and age can inform tobacco flavour regulations to addess flavour appeal especially among youth.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We consider an alternative hypothesis that e-cigarette warnings discourage both vaping and smoking. METHODS: Participants were a national convenience sample of 2218 US adults who used e-cigarettes, cigarettes or both. In August 2018, we randomised participants to one of three warning types (control text about littering, text-only e-cigarette warning or pictorial e-cigarette warning). We further randomised participants viewing e-cigarette warnings to one of three topics (nicotine addiction, health hazards of use, or both health hazards and harms of use). The preregistered primary outcome was intentions to quit vaping among e-cigarette users. Secondary outcomes included interest in smoking and Tobacco Warnings Model constructs: attention, negative affect, anticipated social interactions and cognitive elaboration. RESULTS: Text warnings elicited higher intentions to quit vaping than control among e-cigarette users (d=0.44, p<0.001), and pictorial warnings elicited still higher intentions to quit vaping than text (d=0.12, p<0.05). Text warnings elicited lower interest in smoking compared with control among smokers (p<0.05); warnings had no other effects on interest in smoking among smokers or non-smokers. Text warnings about health hazards elicited higher intentions to quit vaping than nicotine addiction warnings. E-cigarette warnings also increased Tobacco Warnings Model constructs. DISCUSSION: E-cigarette health warnings may motivate users to quit vaping and discourage smoking. The most promising warnings include health hazards (other than nicotine addiction) and imagery. We found no support for the hypothesis that e-cigarette warnings could encourage smoking cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This is the first study to directly investigate the impact of adding and removing messages from cigarette HWLs on smokers' awareness of harms. METHODS: Data were drawn from nine waves of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Canada Survey, a national representative cohort of adult smokers (n=5863) conducted nearly annually between 2002 and 2013-2014. Two analytical approaches were conducted: generalised estimating equation (GEE) regression models estimated adjusted percentages of correct smoking-related health statements at each wave and segmented regression analyses modelled temporal trends in awareness before and after the revisions by measuring the difference in slopes. RESULTS: Adding messages to HWLs significantly increased awareness that smoking causes blindness (OR=3.36 (95% CI 2.71 to 4.18); p<0.001; estimated increase of 1.01 million smokers in Canada) and bladder cancer (OR=2.14 (95% CI 1.71 to 2.66), p<0.001; estimated increase of 1.09 million smokers). Adding the warning that nicotine causes addiction did not significantly impact smokers' awareness. Removing messages was shown to decrease awareness that cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide (OR=0.53 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.70), p<0.001; estimated decrease of 342 000 smokers) and smoking causes impotence (p=0.007 for the difference in slopes; estimated decrease of 354 000 smokers). CONCLUSIONS: Adding messages to HWLs increases smokers' awareness of health facts, but removing messages decreases awareness. These findings demonstrate the importance of carefully considering the implications of adding and especially removing messages from HWLs and the importance of regularly revising warnings.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This cross-sectional study examined correlations for multiple measures of adolescent e-cigarette use with nicotine exposure quantified with salivary cotinine levels. METHODS: Adolescents (N=173, age 13-18) who reported past-month e-cigarette use were recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area. Participants self-reported: (1) days of e-cigarette use in a typical month, (2) number of e-cigarette sessions in a typical day (sessions per day; SPD) and the (3) E-Cigarette Addiction Severity Index (EASI). Participants also completed the 10-item Penn State Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index (ECDI), which we examined in full and as a 2-item Heaviness of Vaping Index (HVI; the sum of the ECDI items on use frequency and time to first vaping on wakening). Sessions per month (SPM) were calculated using days per month and SPD. Cotinine levels, SPD and SPM were log-transformed. RESULTS: Among frequency measures, SPM correlated most strongly with cotinine (r=0.59), followed closely by days per month (r=0.58) and SPD (r=0.57), p<0.001. Among dependence measures, the EASI correlated most strongly with cotinine (r=0.51), closely followed by the ECDI and HVI (r's=0.50), all p's<0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents' reports of frequency of e-cigarette use and degree of addiction correlated significantly with cotinine as a biomarker of nicotine exposure. We recommend the EASI and days per month as brief general measures. SPM and the ECDI are more extensive measures that may yield a more nuanced understanding of use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

Sweet flavours contribute to the appeal of WPT and are a potential regulatory target. This study investigated use, preferences and perceptions of WPT flavours in pregnant WPT users, and the impact of flavour preferences on preconception/prenatal WPT use and exposure biomarkers. METHODS: 58 pregnant WPT users (mean age=27 years) completed a detailed interview regarding their WPT flavours use, preferences and perceptions. Biomarkers of nicotine and carcinogen exposure (eg, cotinine, benzene, butadiene) were also collected. RESULTS: 55% of participants were dual/poly WPT users (ie, reported use of one or more other tobacco products in addition to WPT). Pregnant WPT users reported nearly exclusive use of flavoured WPT, with greater use of menthol/mint (68%) followed by fruit flavours (48%) (p<0.001), and greater preferences for fruit followed by menthol/mint flavours (ps<0.05). Harm perceptions did not differ among flavours. Compared with dual/poly WPT users, WPT-only users reported more total WPT use events, greater use of and preference for menthol/mint flavoured WPT (ps<0.001), and decreased exposure biomarkers (ps≤0.040). Preference for menthol/mint and fruit flavours predicted more flavoured WPT use events during preconception and pregnancy; preference for menthol/mint predicted detectable cotinine and benzene levels but not butadiene. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of WPT flavour use, preferences and perceptions in pregnant women. Use of and preference for menthol/mint and fruit WPT flavours in this vulnerable population could be considered in regulating WPT flavours to protect the health of women and children.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The company's assertions that the product replaces cigarettes in a market have never been independently tested. The objective of this study is to determine whether introduction of IQOS affected cigarette sales in a large economy. DATA AND METHODS: Using 2014 to 2018 monthly retailer panel data from Japan, we analyse whether different dates of IQOS introduction across Japan's regions are reflected in the patterns of cigarette sales in those regions. A series of placebo models are estimated to test if events other than IQOS introduction could have better explained the observed trends in cigarette sales. RESULTS: Cigarette sales begin to substantially decline at the time of the introduction of IQOS in each of 11 Japanese regions (Chow tests p<0.001). IQOS introduction, which varied across regions, better predicted the timing of cigarette sales decline than any one time applied to all regions simultaneously (a national-level exogenous shock) and than nearly all possible rearrangements of the true IQOS introduction months among the regions (exact permutation test's p value from 0.02 to 0.13, depending on the study approach). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of IQOS likely reduced cigarette sales in Japan. The net population health impact, however, cannot be assessed without resolving several key uncertainties related to the direct harms of IQOS and the precise patterns of both smoking and IQOS use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the relationship between exposure to tobacco marketing in bars/nightclubs and number of alternative tobacco/nicotine products used 6 months later among college students. METHODS: Participants were 1,406 students aged 18-29 years old who reported going to bars or nightclubs at least rarely (M age=21.95; 67% female; 46% non-Hispanic white). Students completed an online survey in fall 2014/spring 2015 (wave 1) and again 6 months later (wave 2). Multilevel Poisson regression models were used to assess the relationship between exposure to three types of marketing at bars/nightclubs at wave 1 (tobacco/nicotine product advertisements; free samples; industry representatives) and number of tobacco products used (range=0-5) at wave 2, controlling for school type (2 year vs 4 year), age, sex, race/ethnicity and frequency of bar visits. An interaction between the number of wave 1 products and each marketing variable was tested. RESULTS: Greater exposure to free samples and tobacco industry representatives at bars/nightclubs predicted a greater number of products used 6 months later, but only among wave 1 non-tobacco users and not among tobacco users. Exposure to advertisements at bars/nightclubs did not predict the number of products used 6 months later. CONCLUSION: Tobacco companies claim that marketing is targeted to those who already use the product, not to non-users. However, the current study indicates tobacco marketing in bars and nightclubs may encourage use among non-users and has no influence on current users.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

It has been manipulated in tobacco smoke and now in electronic cigarettes by the use of acids to de-freebase nicotine and form 'nicotine salts'. METHODS: Measurements on electronic cigarette fluids (e-liquids) were carried out to determine (1) the fraction of nicotine in the free-base form (αfb) and (2) the levels of organic acid(s) and nicotine. Samples included JUUL 'pods', 'look-a-like/knock-off' pods and some bottled 'nicotine salt' and 'non-salt' e-liquids. RESULTS: αfb= 0.12 ±0.01 at 40°C (≈ 37°C) for 10 JUUL products, which contain benzoic acid; nicotine protonation is extensive but incomplete. DISCUSSION: First-generation e-liquids have αfb ≈ 1. At cigarette-like total nicotine concentration (Nictot) values of ~60 mg/mL, e-liquid aerosol droplets with αfb≈ 1 are harsh upon inhalation. The design evolution for e-liquids has paralleled that for smoked tobacco, giving a 'déjà vu' trajectory for αfb. For 17th-century 'air-cured' tobacco, αfb in the smoke particles was likely ≥ 0.5. The product αfbNictot in the smoke particles was high. 'Flue-curing' retains higher levels of leaf sugars, which are precursors for organic acids in tobacco smoke, resulting in αfb ≈ 0.02 and lowered harshness. Some tobacco cigarette formulations/designs have been adjusted to restore some nicotine sensory 'kick/impact' with αfb≈ 0.1, as for Marlboro. Overall, for tobacco smoke, the de-freebasing trajectory was αfb ≥ 0.5 → ~0 →~0.1, as compared with αfb= ~1 →~0.1 for e-cigarettes. For JUUL, the result has been, perhaps, an optimised, flavoured nicotine delivery system. The design evolution for e-cigarettes has made them more effective as substitutes to get smokers off combustibles. However, this evolution has likely made e-cigarette products vastly more addictive for never-smokers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

RESULTS: Disposable NVP price was higher than the price of a comparable unit for combustible cigarettes in England (EN), USA and Canada (CA). Prefilled cartridge price was higher than the price of a comparable unit of cigarettes in USA and CA, but lower in EN and Australia. E-liquid price was consistently lower than the price of a comparable unit of cigarettes across four countries. For start-up costs, price of a rechargeable device is approximately 3-5 times higher than a pack of cigarettes in four countries. CONCLUSION: NVP prices were generally higher than prices of combustible cigarettes, especially the high upfront NVP devices. The high upfront costs of purchasing a reusable NVP may discourage some smokers from switching to vaping. However, the average lower costs of cartridges and e-liquids relative to a package of cigarettes make switching to a NVP an attractive alternative to smoking in the long term so long as smokers switch completely to vaping.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, the studies they cite predominantly use one specific measurement of comparative risk. We analysed a representative sample of US adult smokers and non-smokers to examine whether the proportion who report e-cigarettes as less harmful than regular cigarettes differs depending on how the comparative risk questions were presented. METHODS: We analysed data from the 2017 Tobacco Products and Risk Perceptions Survey. Comparative risk of cigarettes and e-cigarettes was measured in two ways: direct (single question) and indirect (by measuring perceived risk of both in separate questions and then subtracting the scores from each other). RESULTS: When asked to compare harms of e-cigarettes and cigarettes directly (single question), 33.9% of participants identified e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes, 36.4% reported equal harm, 4.3% said e-cigarettes were more harmful and 25.3% said 'I don't know'. When asked indirectly (separate questions), 42.1% identified e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes, 23.8% said they were of equal harm, 7.1% perceived e-cigarettes to be more harmful and 27.1% did not know. CONCLUSION: Our study offers evidence to suggest the need to use both direct and indirect risk questions when assessing the public's perceptions of harms associated with novel tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study is the first to provide a systematic overview of how leading tobacco product brands use popular social media platforms. METHODS: We identified 112 leading brands of e-cigarettes, hookah, cigars, cigarettes and smokeless tobacco based on sales and self-report user data. We searched for each brand on six platforms: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest and Tumblr. In early 2019, we conducted a content analysis of each page, coding: age restrictions, warning display, page characteristics and post characteristics. RESULTS: Cigarette brands were generally not present. Most e-cigarettes, hookah and cigar brands had pages on at least two platforms. One-third of smokeless brands had pages on at least one platform. Few brands had pages on Pinterest and Tumblr. Most pages had existed for 3-5 years. Overall, brand pages rarely used age gating, did not display health warnings, generally posted images of a product alone and often used hashtags unrelated to tobacco. Brands commonly used special features like ephemeral posts on Instagram and pop-up chat windows on Facebook. Many pages displayed images of young people and mentioned flavour. Median followers per brand ranged from about 1 000-10 000, and total followers summed across brands reached over 5 million on Facebook and Instagram alone. CONCLUSIONS: Leading brands of most tobacco product types use social media extensively. Several findings identify issues related to youth exposure to and appeal of tobacco social media marketing. Findings can inform tobacco education efforts and regulation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study assessed trends in e-cigarette advertising expenditures in the USA during 2014-2018, overall and by manufacturer and media type. METHODS: Data came from Kantar Media, which provides information on US advertising expenditures, including for e-cigarettes. Advertising expenditures were estimated as the dollar amount spent by e-cigarette companies to purchase advertising space in print, television, Internet, radio and outdoors. Dollar amounts were adjusted to 2017 dollars. Trends in e-cigarette advertising expenditures during 2014-2018 were analysed using Joinpoint regression overall, by media type, and by manufacturers based on 2017-2018 national sales. RESULTS: Total e-cigarette advertising expenditures in print, radio, television, Internet and outdoors decreased substantially from US$133 million in 2014 to US$48 million in 2017, followed by an increase to US$110 million in 2018. By media type, expenditures were highest for print advertising, irrespective of year. By manufacturer, Altria had the highest e-cigarette advertising expenditures, totalling over US$134 million during 2014-2018. Imperial Tobacco had the second highest, totalling over US$85 million during 2014-2018, while JUUL Labs had the highest single-year expenditures, spending over US$73 million in 2018 alone. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette advertising expenditures have been volatile in the USA, with declines in traditional advertising venues during 2014-2017 that may reflect a shift towards social media. However, an increase occurred in 2018 that is likely reflective of advertising by newer manufacturers. Continued monitoring of e-cigarette advertising is important to inform tobacco control strategies.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

An overview of e-liquid ingredients is needed to select target ingredients for chemical analytical and toxicological research and for regulatory approaches aimed at reducing e-cigarette attractiveness. Using information from e-cigarette manufacturers, we aim to identify the flavouring ingredients most frequently added to e-liquids on the Dutch market. Additionally, we used flavouring compositions to automatically classify e-liquids into flavour categories, thereby generating an overview that can facilitate market surveillance. METHODS: We used a dataset containing 16 839 e-liquids that were manually classified into 16 flavour categories in our previous study. For the overall set and each flavour category, we identified flavourings present in more than 10% of the products and their median quantities. Next, quantitative and qualitative ingredient information was used to predict e-liquid flavour categories using a random forest algorithm. RESULTS: We identified 219 unique ingredients that were added to more than 100 e-liquids, of which 213 were flavourings. The mean number of flavourings per e-liquid was 10±15. The most frequently used flavourings were vanillin (present in 35% of all liquids), ethyl maltol (32%) and ethyl butyrate (28%). In addition, we identified 29 category-specific flavourings. Moreover, e-liquids' flavour categories were predicted with an overall accuracy of 70%. CONCLUSIONS: Information from manufacturers can be used to identify frequently used and category-specific flavourings. Qualitative and quantitative ingredient information can be used to successfully predict an e-liquid's flavour category, serving as an example for regulators that have similar datasets available.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: 89 WT smokers completed four ad libitum smoking sessions (characterising flavor/high humectant (+F+H); characterising flavor/low humectant (+F-H); no characterising flavor/high humectant (-F+H); no characterising flavor/low humectant (-F-H)) in a randomised cross-over design. WT was commercially available; same brand but nicotine levels were not held constant. A subsample (n=50) completed a standardised, 10-puff session preceding ad libitum smoking. Participants completed questionnaires, exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) testing and provided blood samples for plasma nicotine. Smoking topography was measured throughout the session. Post hoc analyses showed that -F+H and -F-H did not differ significantly in humectant levels. Therefore, these groups were collapsed in analyses (-F-H). RESULTS: WT smokers reported significantly greater satisfaction, liking, enjoyment and greater intentions for continued use when smoking +F+H compared with other WT products, with -F-H receiving the lowest ratings. Significant differences in topography were observed during standardised and ad libitum sessions, with the -F-H preparation leading to greater total inhaled volume and eCO boost, but lower nicotine boost compared with +F+H (all p<0.05). DISCUSSION: The findings demonstrate the importance of flavours and humectants on improving WT smoking experience and increasing the likelihood that users will want to initiate and continue smoking. Moreover, it demonstrates that flavours and humectants influence smoking behaviour and toxicant exposure in some unexpected ways that are important for regulatory efforts.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Because ECIG nicotine yield is proportional to the product of liquid nicotine concentration (milligram per millilitre) and device power (watts) regulations that limit liquid nicotine concentration may drive users to adopt higher wattage devices to obtain a desired nicotine yield. In this study we investigated, under various hypothetical regulatory limits on ECIG liquid nicotine concentration, a scenario in which a user of a common ECIG device (SMOK TF-N2) seeks to obtain in 15 puffs the nicotine emissions equivalent to one combustible cigarette (ie, 1.8 mg). We measured total aerosol and carbonyl compound (CC) yields in 15 puffs as a function of power (15-80 W) while all else was held constant. The estimated nicotine concentration needed to achieve combustible cigarette-like nicotine yield at each power level was then computed based on the measured liquid consumption. We found that for a constant nicotine yield of 1.8 mg, reducing the liquid nicotine concentration resulted in greater amount of liquid aerosolised (p<0.01) and greater CC emissions (p<0.05). Thus, if users seek a given nicotine yield, regulatory limits on nicotine concentration may have the unintended consequence of increasing exposure to aerosol and respiratory toxicants. This outcome demonstrates that attempting to control ECIG nicotine yield by regulating one factor at a time may have unintended health effects and highlights the need to consider multiple factors and outcomes simultaneously when designing regulations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Yet, controlled studies examining the effects of restricting flavour are lacking. This study evaluates the impact of ENDS flavour manipulation on user's puffing behaviour, subjective experience, harm perception and nicotine exposure among college-aged ENDS users. METHODS: JUUL users (n=30, age 18 to 24 years) attended two 60 min ad libitum ENDS use sessions (JUUL preferred flavour vs JUUL classic tobacco flavour) in a cross-over design. Puff topography and plasma nicotine concentration were measured, and participants completed subjective experience questionnaires. RESULTS: Increases were observed on measures of satisfaction, taste, enjoyment, urges to vape/smoke, pleasure, product appeal and increased concentration following using the preferred flavour pod (p values <0.05). Compared with preferred flavour, participants in the tobacco flavour were less motivated to use it in the future (70.9 vs 19.1 scores, p<0.001), even if it was the only product on the market (75.8 vs 30.7 scores, p<0.001). While nicotine levels significantly increased in both conditions from pre to post session (p values <0.001), no significant differences were observed in nicotine boost levels or on puff topography parameters when comparing both flavour conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study provides evidence that ENDS flavours have a substantial effect in enhancing young current ENDS users' experiences, product appeal and motivation to use the product in the future. It highlights that limiting flavours could play a potential role when designing strategic policies to reduce the appeal of ENDS use among young people.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

US law requires FDA to deny marketing authorisation if applicants fail to demonstrate that their product is 'appropriate for the protection of the public health'. FDA issued a marketing order for IQOS in April 2019, which Philip Morris is using to promote IQOS outside the USA. METHODS: We analysed FDA's Technical Project Lead Review and marketing order for IQOS, relevant law and guidance on PMTAs and independent research on the health impacts of IQOS. RESULTS: FDA found that the evidence PMPSA submitted did not demonstrate reduction in long-term disease risks and that IQOS aerosol emits toxins with carcinogenic and genotoxic potential, some at higher levels than conventional cigarettes. PMPSA did not appropriately consider the health impacts of dual use, the product's attractiveness to youth or data showing that consumers do not accurately perceive the addiction risks of IQOS. Despite FDA's own scientists' recommendations and independent research showing that IQOS presents serious risks to users including cytotoxic, genotoxic, hepatotoxic, cardiovascular and pulmonary risks, FDA concluded that IQOS is 'appropriate for the protection of the public health'. CONCLUSION: FDA's decision allowing IQOS to be marketed in the USA disregarded valid scientific evidence and misapplied the public health standard mandated by law. This decision may have important health impacts, influence marketing IQOS outside the USA and erode public confidence in FDA's future PMTA decisions.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

As in most countries, the point-of-sale (POS) remains an important marketing channel for the tobacco industry. Therefore, we sought to characterise the POS marketing of these products in the two largest cities in Guatemala. METHODS: Convenience stores were randomly surveyed in mid and high socioeconomic status (SES) neighbourhoods in Guatemala City (n=60) and Quetzaltenango (n=15) in 2019. We adapted a previously implemented checklist to assess the availability of interior advertising of capsule cigarettes, e-cigarettes and HTP. Data entry was done in Kobo toolbox and analysis in STATA. RESULTS: All stores sold conventional and flavoured capsule cigarettes, 78% e-cigarettes and 68% HTP. Most cigarette advertising was for capsule cigarettes. E-cigarettes were more likely to be sold in Guatemala City (96%) than in Quetzaltenango (13%). HTPs were only found in Guatemala City (85%), with no difference between high and medium SES neighbourhoods. Median number of ads for cigarettes and capsule cigarettes was higher in the high SES neighbourhood. Most e-cigarettes (83%) and HTP (74%) were found <50 cm from candy. E-cigarettes and HTP were available in a wide range of flavours. All stores that sold HTP had flavoured HEETS (amber, bronze, turquoise, yellow, blue and purple). CONCLUSION: We found a high prevalence of advertising for capsule cigarettes, e-cigarettes and HTP at the POS. The POS, a crucial advertising channel for the tobacco industry, is now being used for new products and therefore needs to be urgently regulated.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: TROs within half-mile of 53 middle and high schools in the four largest Metropolitan areas in Texas were audited for all tobacco marketing. ArcGIS was used for mapping and grouping TROs by distance from the schools and simulating the ban. Mean differences in the number of tobacco advertisements were examined with t-tests. Percentage reductions in tobacco advertisements were calculated after simulation of both bans, reported by school type and by location, product and flavour. RESULTS: TROs within 1000 ft of schools had significantly more tobacco advertisements as compared with TROs located within 1000-2000 ft (p=0.03) for all schools combined and middle schools. Simulation of the 1000 ft ban of TROs led to a slightly greater reduction in advertisements (19.4%) as compared with the 500 ft ban of TROs from other TROs (17.9%). The reduction in all advertisement types was greater around middle schools and greatest for e-cigarettes (23.6%). CONCLUSION: Students can be exposed to a great deal of tobacco advertising in TROs around their schools. The implementation of a 1000 ft ban of TROs, or at minimum a ban on tobacco advertising outside and within these outlets, is one way to prevent or reduce the use of tobacco among adolescents.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We compared changes over time in noticing warnings and leaflets, recall of warnings about nicotine and concerns about using NVP due to noticing warnings in England, compared with Canada, the US and Australia, where no warnings and leaflets were mandated. DESIGN: 19 005 adult (aged 18+) NVP users, smokers and quitters of cigarettes and NVP from the 2016 and 2018 International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping Surveys in England, Canada, the US and Australia, recruited via probability and non-probability sampling. FINDINGS: Noticing warnings increased in England from 4.9% (2016) to 9.4% (2018) (adjusted OR/AOR=1.64, 95% CI=1.15-2.36); this change was larger than changes in Canada (AOR=2.51, 95% CI=1.71-3.69) and the US (AOR=2.22, 95% CI=1.45-3.39). Recall of a nicotine warning increased in England from 86% (2016) to 94.9% (2018) (AOR=5.50, 95% CI=1.57-19.27) but not significantly elsewhere. Noticing leaflets increased in England from 14.6% (2016) to 19.1% (2018) (AOR=1.42, 95% CI=1.15-1.74); this change was larger than in Canada (AOR=1.42, 95% CI=1.12-1.79), the US (AOR=1.55, 95% CI=1.17-2.06) and Australia (AOR=1.51, 95% CI=1.02-2.22). Among those noticing warnings, concern about NVP use did not change significantly between 2016 and 2018 (all countries p>0.081). CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of mandatory NVP warnings and leaflets in England was associated with small increases in noticing them but not with changes in concerns about NVP use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We aimed to analyse Twitter data to gain insights into tobacco industry tactics, arguments and allies. METHODS: We retrieved 9089 tweets that included #COP8FCTC between 1 and 9 October 2018. We categorised the tweets' content and sentiment through manual coding and machine learning. We used an investigative procedure using publicly available information to categorise the most active Twitter users and investigate tobacco industry links. Network analysis was used to visualise interactions and detect communities. RESULTS: Most tweets were about next-generation products (NGPs) or 'harm reduction' (54%) and tended to argue in support of NGPs; around one-quarter were critical of tobacco control (24%). The largest proportion of most active tweeters were NGP advocates, and slightly over half of those had either links to the Philip Morris International (PMI) funded Foundation for a Smoke-Free World (FSFW) and/or to the International Network of Nicotine Consumer Organisations, a network to whom the FSFW granted US$100 300 in 2018. PMI was the most active transnational tobacco company during COP8. CONCLUSIONS: The nature of the activity on Twitter around COP8, including a substantial online presence by PMI executives and NGP advocates with links to organisations funded directly and indirectly by PMI, is highly consistent with PMI's 2014 corporate affairs strategy, which described engaging tobacco harm reduction advocates to 'amplify and leverage the debate on harm reduction' around events such as the COP.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

We examined the primary targets, motivations and strategies behind targeted marketing activities in Singapore from the tobacco industry's perspective to understand how tobacco companies continue to target people in their marketing. METHODS: Snowball search in the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library for documents covering the industry's targeted marketing activities in Singapore. Information from the documents was subsequently triangulated with market data obtained from the Euromonitor Passport database, analysed for trends by tar segment and data from cigarette packs purchased from Singapore retailers, analysed in terms of product positioning. RESULTS: In the 1970s and 1980s, as young people in Singapore became more health-conscious, tobacco companies positioned 'light' cigarettes for growth in the 1990s. Many of these 'lights' contained similar tar and nicotine levels as regular brands; they were only light in their branding. In the 1990's, 'lights' became more popular in Singapore and this demand was largely youth driven. Into the 2010s, while the low tar (<6 mg) segment comprised only a small portion of Singapore's cigarette market, most cigarette variants were marketed as 'lighter' or as having harm reductive benefits to appeal to more health-conscious people. CONCLUSIONS: The differentiation of 'lighter' cigarettes remains an important marketing tool for tobacco companies amidst Singapore's strict regulations. Legislation to remove all remaining avenues for tobacco companies to make harm reduction claims on their products, explicit or implicit, coupled with improving health literacy and exposing industry deception, could help to further bring down smoking prevalence in Singapore.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: Cross-sectional data were used from an online study of adults in the UK (n=53 002). Main outcome measures were confirmed and suspected COVID-19, worry about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and adherence to protective behaviours. Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, education (post-16 qualifications: yes/no), key worker status and comorbid health conditions. RESULTS: Compared with never smokers (0.26% (95% CI 0.21% to 0.33%)), prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 was higher among current (0.56% (0.41% to 0.75%)) but not ex-smokers (0.19% (0.13% to 0.28%)). Associations were similar before (current: OR=2.14 (1.49-3.08); ex-smokers: OR=0.73 (0.47-1.14)) and after (current: OR=1.79 (1.22-2.62); ex-smokers: OR=0.85 (0.54-1.33)) adjustment. For current smokers, this was moderated by socio-economic position, with higher rates only seen in those without post-16 qualifications (OR=3.53 (2.04-6.10)). After including suspected cases, prevalence was higher among current smokers (11.2% (10.6% to 11.9%), OR=1.11 (1.03-1.20)) and ex-smokers (10.9% (10.4% to 11.5%), OR=1.07 (1.01-1.15)) than never smokers (10.2% (9.9% to 10.6%)), but remained higher only among ex-smokers after adjustment (OR=1.21 (1.13-1.29)). Current and ex-smokers had higher odds than never smokers of reporting significant stress about becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (current: OR=1.34 (1.27-1.43); ex-smokers: OR=1.22 (1.16-1.28)). Adherence to recommendations to prevent spread of COVID-19 was high (96.3% (96.1% to 96.4%)), but lower among current than never smokers (OR=0.70 (0.62-0.78)). CONCLUSIONS: In a population sample, current smoking was independently associated with self-reported confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were socio-economic disparities, with the association only apparent among those without post-16 qualifications. Smokers reported lower adherence to guidelines despite being more worried than non-smokers about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We examined reactions to COVID-19 and traditional health harms messages discouraging smoking and vaping. METHODS: Participants were a national convenience sample of 810 US adults recruited online in May 2020. All participated in a smoking message experiment and a vaping message experiment, presented in a random order. In each experiment, participants viewed one message formatted as a Twitter post. The experiments adopted a 3 (traditional health harms of smoking or vaping: three harms, one harm, absent) × 2 (COVID-19 harms: one harm, absent) between-subjects design. Outcomes included perceived message effectiveness (primary) and constructs from the Tobacco Warnings Model (secondary: attention, negative affect, cognitive elaboration, social interactions). RESULTS: Smoking messages with traditional or COVID-19 harms elicited higher perceived effectiveness for discouraging smoking than control messages without these harms (all p <0.001). However, including both traditional and COVID-19 harms in smoking messages had no benefit beyond including either alone. Smoking messages affected Tobacco Warnings Model constructs and did not elicit more reactance than control messages. Smoking messages also elicited higher perceived effectiveness for discouraging vaping. Including traditional harms in messages about vaping elicited higher perceived effectiveness for discouraging vaping (p <0.05), but including COVID-19 harms did not. CONCLUSIONS: Messages linking smoking with COVID-19 may hold promise for discouraging smoking and may have the added benefit of also discouraging vaping.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

DESIGN: Data came from Wave 2 of the ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey, collected from February to July 2018. Respondents were current and former smokers and/or users of vaping products (18 years or older) from Canada (CA; n=3778), England (EN; n=4848), the USA (US; n=2846) and Australia (AU; n=1515). At the time of the survey, only Canada and England permitted the sale of contemporary HTPs (eg, IQOS). RESULTS: Overall, 30.2% of respondents reported being aware of HTPs (CA=30.4%; EN=31.0%; US=30.2%; AU=27.4%; p=0.346), 2.4% had ever tried HTPs (CA=3.3%; EN=2.4%; US=2.0%; AU=0.9%; p=0.001) and 0.9% currently used HTPs at least monthly (CA=0.8%; EN=1.2%; US=0.7%; AU=0.2%; p<0.001). Trial and current use were higher among those who concurrently smoked and vaped (at least monthly) versus other nicotine use categories (trial: 10.9% v. 1.2%-2.0%, p<0.001; current use: 8.4% v. 0.1%-1.0%, p<0.001). In multivariable analyses, HTP awareness did not differ across countries, whereas odds of trial and current use were lower where HTPs were unavailable. Odds of HTP trial did not differ by regulatory environment when restricting analysis to HTP-aware concurrent smokers-vapers. CONCLUSION: Approximately one third of respondents were aware of HTPs, even in the USA and Australia, where contemporary HTPs were not yet on the market. Trial and use were uncommon, except among concurrent smokers-vapers. Restrictions on availability may have limited HTP use generally, but less so for concurrent smokers-vapers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Yet in 2017, a new scientific organisation-the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World (FSFW)-was launched, funded entirely by tobacco corporation Philip Morris International (PMI). Experts fear FSFW similarly serves to benefit its funder's scientific and political agenda. We present three case studies of FSFW's publishing practices to explore: whether FSFW and its affiliates are acting with scientific integrity in their attempts to publish research; how conflicts of interest (COI) are governed in the journals FSFW targets; whether scientific publishing needs to be better protected from the tobacco industry in light of this, and if so, how. FSFW and its grantees have resorted to repeated obfuscation when publishing their science. FSFW staff have failed to act transparently and arguably have sought control over editorial processes (at times facilitated by PR firm, Ruder Finn). FSFW-funded organisations (including its Italian 'Centre of Excellence') and researchers affiliated with FSFW (including those working as editors and peer-reviewers) have failed to disclose their links to FSFW and PMI. While journals also failed to apply their COI policies, including on tobacco industry-funded research, the findings highlight that such policies are almost entirely dependent on researchers fully declaring all potential COIs. The paper explores ways to address these problems, including via standardised reporting of COI and funding in journals; journal policies prohibiting publication of tobacco industry-funded science; development of an author-centric database of financial interests; and legally mandated tobacco industry financial contributions to fund science on new tobacco and nicotine products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In Australia, where heated tobacco products are prohibited, the company recently attempted to overturn Australian legislation in order to permit their sale. In light of this recent move, this study presents a case study of the company's strategies to legalise and distribute IQOS in the Australian market. METHODS: To assess Philip Morris' lobbying activities and corporate strategies, a case study approach was used by triangulating data from three sources: interviews with former Philip Morris employees, news articles reporting Philip Morris' lobbying activities or plans for IQOS in Australia, and submissions to relevant government inquiries and reviews from 2015 to 2020. RESULTS: Philip Morris has actively lobbied Australian policy-makers to overturn bans on nicotine-containing products. Information obtained from key informants and Philip Morris' government submissions indicates that the company's goal is for heated tobacco products in Australia to be regulated in a new product category, exempt from tobacco control laws. Informants revealed that Philip Morris was also working to establish a network of upmarket pubs, clubs and bars where they could sell IQOS once legalisation was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Philip Morris has strongly lobbied the Australian government to legalise heated tobacco products, while simultaneously making plans to sell IQOS at young adult-friendly premises such as bars, clubs and pubs if its proposed legislative changes are made. This case study provides valuable insights for other countries where Philip Morris may be replicating similar strategies to weaken tobacco control legislation.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: We reviewed information related to ENDS in Thailand between 2014 and 2019 from Thai newspaper articles, meeting minutes and letters submitted to government agencies, websites and social media platforms of pro-ENDS networks and Thai tobacco control organisations. RESULTS: The tobacco industry and the pro-ENDS groups used five tactics to try to reverse the Thai ban on ENDS: creating front groups, lobbying decision-makers, running public relations campaigns, seeking to discredit tobacco control advocates and funding pro-tobacco harm reduction research. ENDS Cigarette Smoking Thailand (ECST), a pro-ENDS group in Thailand, worked in parallel to Philip Morris Thailand Limited (PMTL) to oppose the ban. The group connected with international coalitions that promote harm reduction through the PMI-funded Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. CONCLUSION: Although ECST and PMTL continuously worked to revoke the ban since 2017, the government still kept ENDS illegal as of October 2020. This decision resulted from the strong commitment and collaboration among Thai tobacco control organisations and their shared vision to protect the public's health from harmful tobacco products. The similar strategies used by the pro-ENDS movement in Thailand and the tobacco companies could inform health advocates and policy-makers in other low and middle income countries facing pressure to market ENDS.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Removal of these constituents, however, is associated with increased intensity of WT puffing, likely due to reduced nicotine delivery efficiency. To clarify the potential public health outcomes of restrictions on flavourants or humectants in WT, we evaluated the effects of these constituents on puffing behaviours, biomarkers of exposure and subjective effects among adults with high versus low WT dependence. METHODS: N=39 high dependence and N=49 low dependence WT smokers (Lebanese Waterpipe Dependence Scale scores >10 = high dependence) completed four smoking sessions in a cross-over experiment. Conditions were preferred flavour with humectant (+F+H), preferred flavour without humectant (+F-H), unflavoured with humectant (-F+H) and unflavoured without humectant (-F-H). Measures of puff topography, plasma nicotine and expired carbon monoxide (eCO) boost, and subjective effects were assessed. RESULTS: Level of WT dependence modified the effect of WT condition on average flow rate, average puff volume and eCO boost. Although, overall, participants puffed the +F+H WT least intensely and -F-H WT most intensely, this association was strongest among WT smokers with high dependence. Participants preferred smoking the +F+H WT and achieved the largest plasma nicotine boost in that condition. DISCUSSION: Findings underscore the complexity of setting product standards related to flavourants and humectants in WT. Future research evaluating whether WT smokers with high dependence would quit or reduce their WT smoking in response to removal of flavourants or humectants from WT is necessary to appreciate the full public health effects of such policies.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

Previous analyses suggest that TTCs used e-cigarette debates to demonstrate alignment with public health and re-gain policy influence. Less is known about the engagement of other types of commercial actors in e-cigarette policy debates. METHODS: This paper is the first to empirically analyse commercial actors' engagement in an e-cigarette policy consultation process and to examine their views on proposed regulation. It applies mixed methods, drawing on policy consultation submissions (n=32), semi-structured interviews (n=9) and a social network analysis of website links among 32 commercial actors. RESULTS: The results show that commercial actors' positions on e-cigarette regulation aligned with business interests. TTCs, independent e-cigarette manufacturers and other non-licensed commercial actors were opposed to most aspects of potential e-cigarette regulation (except for age of sale restrictions), whereas licensed commercial actors, including pharmaceutical companies, supported more stringent regulation. While collaboration was viewed as strategically important to gain policy influence, distinct commercial interests and concerns about TTC credibility led to strategic distancing and to collaboration being largely confined to sector boundaries. In addition to reiterating arguments employed by TTCs in previous regulatory debates, commercial actors focused on highlighting the technical complexity and harm reduction potential of e-cigarettes. CONCLUSION: Awareness of the various commercial interests and strategic positioning of commercial actors in e-cigarette policy should inform public health advocacy and policy development, including managing conflicts of interest in the context of Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Article 5.3.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We investigated the relationship between e-cigarette use and smoking cessation among South African adult smokers. METHODS: Data came from a 2018 web survey of South African adults aged ≥18 years (n=18 208). Cessation-related attitudes and behaviours were assessed. Using multivariable logistic regression, we measured the association between e-cigarette use and cessation behaviours among ever-established combustible tobacco smokers who tried to quit. FINDINGS: Among current combustible smokers, more e-cigarette ever versus never users believed e-cigarettes could assist smokers to completely quit (35.5% vs 20.4%) or cut down (51.7% vs 26.5%) (all p<0.05). Among ever-established smokers, the odds of sustained quitting at the 12-month mark were lower among those who used e-cigarettes once off/rarely (adjusted OR (AOR)=0.20, 95% CI=0.16-0.24), former e-cigarette users (AOR=0.30, 95% CI=0.24-0.38) and current e-cigarette users (AOR=0.23, 95% CI=0.18-0.29), compared with never e-cigarette users. Among ever-established smokers who had ever tried to quit, 53.6% relapsed into smoking after quitting for any length of time. The odds of relapsing among ever-established smokers who had made a quit attempt and had a quit intention were higher among those who used e-cigarettes once off/rarely (AOR=2.66; 95% CI=2.31-3.08), former e-cigarette users (AOR=1.41; 95% CI=1.18-1.69) and current e-cigarette users (AOR=1.85; 95% CI=1.55-2.22) than never e-cigarette users. CONCLUSION: e-Cigarette use depressed long-term cessation. These findings can inform restrictions on unsubstantiated claims of e-cigarettes as cessation aids within South Africa.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

METHODS: We analysed a total of 571 print and TV news covering HTP regulations, published between 2017 and 2018, the time period when HTPs were introduced to the country and various regulations of HTPs were proposed and implemented. We assessed the prevalence and associations among specific types of HTP regulations that were discussed, valence towards regulation, sources, framing of the relative health risks/benefits of HTPs compared with conventional cigarettes. RESULTS: Taxation (55.2%) and warning labels (25.7%) were two regulation topics covered the most. Almost equal proportions of pro-regulation (2.5%) and anti-regulation valence (2.2%) were found in taxation-related news, while pro-regulation valence appeared more frequently for other restrictions, including warning labels (pro=9.5% vs anti=1.4%), marketing restrictions (pro=6.9% vs anti=0%) and integration of HTPs into smoke-free policies for cigarettes (pro=8.7% vs anti=0%). The government (59%), followed by the tobacco industry (39.4%), was the source cited most often across news stories while the presence of tobacco control advocates was low (4.9%). As for framing, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of stories mentioning reduced harm (31.7%) and equal or more harm (33.6%) of HTPs compared with cigarettes.

Nearly all factory-made cigarettes (FMC) now have filter ventilation in countries such as Australia, Canada, the UK and the USA. Research conducted before 'light' and 'mild' labelling was banned found low smoker awareness of filter ventilation and its effects. This study explores current levels of awareness of filter ventilation and current understanding of its effects in these four countries. METHODS: We used data from the 2018 wave of the ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey with samples from USA, England, Canada and Australia. Analyses were conducted initially on a weighted sample of 11 844, and subsequently on 7541 daily FMC smokers. FINDINGS: Only 40.3% of all respondents reported being aware of filter ventilation. Among daily FMC smokers, only 9.4% believed their cigarettes had filter ventilation. Believing that their usual cigarettes are smoother was positively associated with believing they are also less harmful. Both these beliefs independently predict believing their cigarettes are ventilated (smoother OR=1.97 (95% CI 1.50 to 2.59) and less harmful OR=2.41 (95% CI 1.66 to 3.49) in relation to those believing each characteristic is average. INTERPRETATION: Awareness of filter ventilation is currently low, despite decades of public 'education efforts around the misleading nature of 'light' and 'mild"" descriptors. Few smokers realise that their cigarettes almost certainly are vented. Smokers who believed their cigarettes have filter ventilation were more likely to believe they were both smoother and less harmful. Awareness of the technology appears to be insufficient to prevent smokers being deceived by it. Filter ventilation is inherently misleading to smokers and it is time to ban it.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

OBJECTIVES: We examined vape shop non-compliance with state-ordered business closures during COVID-19, changes in their marketing and experiences among consumers. METHODS: As part of a longitudinal study of vape retail in six metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs; Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City, San Diego and Seattle), we conducted: (1) legal research to determine whether statewide COVID-19 orders required vape shops to close; (2) phone-based and web-based surveillance to assess vape shop activity in March-June 2020 during shelter-in-place periods; and (3) a concurrent online survey of e-cigarette users about their experiences with vape retail. RESULTS: Non-essential business closure varied in timing/duration across states and applied to vape shops in California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma (for a brief period) and Washington (Georgia's orders were ambiguous). Surveillance analysis focused on the five MSAs in these states. Of 156 vape shops, 53.2% were open as usual, 11.5% permanently closed and 3.8% temporarily closed; 31.4% offered pick-up/delivery services. Among survey respondents (n=354, M age =23.9±4.6; 46.9% male, 71.8% white, 13.0% Hispanic), 27.4% worried their vape shop would close/go out of business during COVID-19; 7.3% said their vape shop did so. Few noticed increases in vape product delivery options (7.3%), discounts/price promotions (9.9%) and/or prices (9.3%). While 20.3% stockpiled vape products, 20.3% tried to reduce use and 15.8% tried to quit. CONCLUSIONS: Many vape shops were non-compliant with state COVID-19 orders.

Selling smokeless tobacco to women, people of colour and the LGBTQ+ community in the USA.","BACKGROUND: In both Sweden and the USA, smokeless tobacco (ST) is legal and used predominantly by men. Starting in the 1970s, US tobacco companies attempted to expand the ST market to women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and other sexual orientation (LGBTQ+) people. DESIGN: We analysed industry documents from the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library triangulating findings with recent ST advertising and publicly available literature. FINDINGS: We found tobacco companies used design innovations such as pouched moist snuff, snus and dissolvable products to expand the market. In addition, diverse advertising campaigns targeted women, people of colour (Hispanic, African American) and LGBTQ+ communities with identity-targeted messages emphasising novelty, convenience, cleanliness and use in smoke-free environments. However, stereotypes of ST users as rural white males endured, perpetuated by continued marketing aimed at this customer base, which created cognitive dissonance and stymied marketer's hopes that pouch products would 'democratize' ST. CONCLUSION: These failed campaigns suggest novel products such as nicotine pouch products may provide a 'clean slate' to similarly target women and other low-ST-using groups. Based on this history, the risk of new tobacco and nicotine products to increase health disparities should be closely monitored.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study examined the effects of IQOS MRCs on risk perceptions and behavioural intentions. METHOD: Based on tobacco companies' MRCs, we manipulated three MRC language features: explanation about 'switching completely' (absent vs present), number of diseases (single vs multiple) and language certainty (hypothetical vs certain). In an online experiment, we randomised 1523 US adult current smokers and 1391 young adult non-smokers to 1 of 9 conditions following a 2×2×2+1 control design. People reported their comprehension of 'switching completely', IQOS risk perceptions and behavioural intentions after message exposure. RESULTS: More smokers exposed to MRCs that included an explanation about 'switching completely' (22.2%) (vs explanation absent (11.2%) and control (10.7%)) mentioned that 'switching completely' meant smoking 0 cigarettes. Compared with the control, several MRCs (eg, certain language) produced lower perceived risk of IQOS, including for diseases not mentioned in the MRCs. MRCs using certain and hypothetical language did not differ on any outcomes. MRCs highlighting reduced risk for a single disease and multiple diseases did not differ on any outcomes. MRCs did not influence behavioural intentions. CONCLUSION: The Food and Drug Administration should ensure that consumers understand what 'switching completely' means in an MRC and recognize that some language features may mislead consumers into believing that a product reduces the risk of diseases not mentioned in an MRC.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

It is essential that clinical trials examining e-cigarettes are fully and accurately reported, especially given long-standing concerns about tobacco industry research. We assess the reporting of clinical trials sponsored by Juul Labs, the largest e-cigarette company in the USA, against accepted reporting standards. METHODS: We searched ClinicalTrials.gov for all trials sponsored by Juul Labs and determined those with registry data consistent with coverage by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Amendments Act 2007 (FDAAA). For trials with a primary completion date more than 1 year earlier, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the academic literature and a Juul-funded research database (JLI Science) for results. For located results, we compared reported outcomes with registered outcomes in line with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guidelines. RESULTS: We located five registered trials sponsored by Juul Labs that appeared covered by the FDAAA 2007 in the public data. All five trials did not have results available on ClinicalTrials.gov. We found one publication and four poster presentations reporting results for four of the five covered trials outside of ClinicalTrials.gov. Of 61 specified outcomes, 28 were CONSORT compliant. Specific outcome reporting issues are detailed. DISCUSSION: Our findings raise substantial concerns regarding these trials. Clinicians, public health professionals, and the public cannot make informed choices about the benefits or hazards of e-cigarettes if the results of clinical trials are not completely and transparently reported. Clarification and potential enforcement of reporting laws may be required.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study updated the analyses of O'Connor et al on types of NVPs used and examined changes in NVP features used over 18 months in four countries with differing regulatory environments. DESIGN: Data are from 4734 adult current vapers in Australia, Canada, England and the USA from Waves 1 (2016) and 2 (2018) of the International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey. NVP characteristics included device description, adjustable voltage, nicotine content and tank size. Longitudinal analyses (n=1058) assessed movement towards or away from more complex/modifiable NVPs. A logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with changes in device description from 2016 to 2018. RESULTS: Like 2016, box-tanks were the most popular NVP (37.3%) in all four countries in 2018. Over 80% of vapers continued using the same NVP and nicotine content between waves, though movement tended towards more complex/modifiable devices (14.4% of vapers). Box-tank users, exclusive daily vapers and older vapers were most likely to continue using the same device description. Certain NVPs and features differed by country, such as higher nicotine contents in the USA (11.5% use 21+ mg/mL) and greater device stability over time in Australia (90.8% stability). CONCLUSIONS: Most vapers continued using the same vaping device and features over 18 months. Differences in NVP types and features were observed between countries, suggesting that differing NVP regulations affect consumer choices regarding the type of vaping device to use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: Data are from repeated cross-sectional online surveys conducted in 2017, 2018 and 2019 with national samples of youth aged 16-19 years, in Canada (n=12 018), England (n=11 362) and the USA (n=12 110). Measures included perceived addiction to cigarettes/e-cigarettes, frequency of experiencing strong urges to smoke/use an e-cigarette, plans to quit smoking/using e-cigarettes and past attempts to quit. Logistic regression models were fitted to examine differences between countries and changes over time. RESULTS: The proportion of ever-users who vaped frequently was significantly higher in 2019 compared with 2017 for all outcomes in each country. Between 2017 and 2019, the proportion of past 30-day vapers reporting strong urges to vape on most days or more often increased in each country (Canada: 35.3%, adjusted OR (AOR) 1.69, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.38; England: 32.8%, AOR 1.55, 1.08 to 2.23; USA: 46.1%, AOR 1.88, 1.41 to 2.50), along with perceptions of being 'a little' or 'very addicted' to e-cigarettes (Canada: 48.3%, AOR 1.99, 1.44 to 2.75; England: 40.1%, AOR 1.44, 1.03 to 2.01; USA: 53.1%, AOR 1.99, 1.50 to 2.63). Indicators of dependence among smokers were consistently greater than e-cigarette users, although differences had narrowed by 2019, particularly in Canada and the USA. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of dependence symptoms among young e-cigarette users increased between 2017 and 2019, more so in Canada and the USA compared with England. Dependence symptom prevalence was lower for e-cigarettes than smoking; however, the gap has narrowed over time.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

METHODS: April-September 2017, a total of 234 VP refill liquids and prefilled cartridges were purchased in convenience samples of retail locations in each country. Products were chosen from brands and styles most commonly reported by current VP users in the 2016 ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey. All products were tested for nicotine, tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), minor tobacco alkaloids, organic acids and flavouring chemicals. RESULTS: Consistent with the laws in Canada and Australia at the time of product purchase, nicotine was not detected in any of the VPs (n=10 in Canada; n=15 in Australia). US liquids (n=54) had a mean nicotine concentration of 16.2 mg/mL, (range=0.0-58.6) and English liquids (n=166) had a mean concentration of 11.9 mg/mL ((range=0.0-31.2) F(3244)=12.32, p<0.001). About 5% of English samples exceeded the UK's 20 mg/mL nicotine limit. Substantial country differences were observed in levels ofTSNAs, with the USA being higher than elsewhere. Of all products tested, 18.8% contained at least one organic acid. Liquids purchased in England contained far more identifiable flavouring chemicals than those in the other countries. CONCLUSIONS: VP composition, particularly with respect to nicotine and flavouring, varies by country, likely reflecting both marketplace preferences and country-specific regulations. There are differences between nicotine levels claimed on the package and actual levels, particularly in England.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

To date, little is known about their design characteristics and toxicant emissions. In this study, we analysed the electrical and chemical characteristics and nicotine and pulmonary toxicant emission profiles of five commonly available flavoured disposable e-cigarettes and compared these data with those of a JUUL, a cartridge-based e-cigarette device that pod-mod-like disposables emulate in size and shape. METHODS: Device construction, electrical power and liquid composition were determined. Machine-generated aerosol emissions including particulate matter, nicotine, carbonyl compounds and heavy metals were also measured. Liquid and aerosol composition were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionisation detection, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. RESULTS: We found that unlike JUUL, disposable devices did not incorporate a microcontroller to regulate electrical power to the heating coil. Quality of construction varied widely. Disposable e-cigarette power ranged between 5 and 9 W and liquid nicotine concentration ranged between 53 and 85 mg/mL (~95% in the protonated form). In 15 puffs, total nicotine yield for the disposables ranged between 1.6 and 6.7 mg, total carbonyls ranged between 28 and 138 µg, and total metals ranged between 1084 and 5804 ng. JUUL emissions were near the floors of all of these ranges. CONCLUSIONS: Disposable e-cigarettes are designed with high nicotine concentration liquids and are capable of emitting much higher nicotine and carbonyl species relative to rechargeable look-alike e-cigarettes. These differences are likely due to the lower quality in construction, unreliable labelling and lack of temperature control regulation that limits the power during operation. From a public health perspective, regulating these devices is important to limit user exposure to carbonyls and nicotine, particularly because these devices are popular with youth and young adults.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We reviewed studies of JUUL's nicotine pharmacokinetic profile and studies quantifying nicotine in a JUULpod, emitted in the aerosol and absorbed by users. Examined in eight studies, JUUL's peak nicotine levels were half to three-quarters that of a combustible cigarette in industry-conducted studies with JUUL-naïve users, while comparable to or greater than combustible cigarettes in independent studies of experienced e-cigarette users. JUUL Labs reports each 5% (nicotine-by-weight) cartridge contains approximately 40 mg nicotine per pod and is 'approximately equivalent to about 1 pack of cigarettes.' In five independent studies, nicotine in the liquid in a JUULpod ranged from 39.3 to 48.3 mg. Seven studies measured nicotine delivery via vaping-machine generated aerosols, varying in puffing regimes and equipment. One study estimated 68% transfer efficiency to the aerosol, measuring 28.8 mg nicotine per JUULpod. The other studies reported nicotine values ranging from 72 to 164 µg/puff. At 200 puffs, this is 14.4-32.8 mg of nicotine per pod with equivalence to 13-30 cigarettes. A study measuring nicotine levels in JUUL users during a 5-day controlled switch found equivalence to 18 cigarettes. One JUULpod appears capable of delivering the nicotine equivalent to smoking about a pack of cigarettes, with variability. In JUUL-naïve smokers, JUUL's nicotine boost was lower than that of combustible cigarettes; while in experienced users, JUUL was comparable. Minimising harshness and adaptive to user experience, JUUL's design facilitates initiation to a high nicotine, and ultimately, highly addictive vaping product.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

OBJECTIVES: In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducts compliance checks, issues fines, and can order retailers to stop selling tobacco products (ie, no-tobacco-sale orders (NTSOs)) to enforce the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. We sought to assess FDA's utilisation of NTSOs. METHODS: We conducted a quantitative content analysis of FDA's enforcement actions for inspections decided between 1 October 2015 and 29 March 2019. From the 536 134 inspection records we identified 148 NTSOs and 249 720 unique retailer locations, of which 2095 had three or more violations. We randomly sampled NTSOs (n=76) and retail locations (n=152) with frequent violations. We calculated the proportion of NTSOs that could have been issued earlier by FDA. We then calculated the proportion of retailers that could have been issued an NTSO, and the proportion actually issued an NTSO using FDA's approach and a more stringent approach. RESULTS: Among NTSOs, 94.7% (95% CI: 89.8% to 97.4%) of NTSOs could have been issued earlier under a more stringent approach. On average, when an NTSO could have been issued earlier, it could have been issued 453 days earlier (95% CI: 418 to 489; range: 89-1159). Among frequently violating retail locations, 73.6% (95% CI: 66.0% to 80.0%) were eligible for an NTSO. Of those, 1.9% (95% CI: 0.5% to 7.0%) had received an NTSO. CONCLUSIONS: The FDA's failure to fully leverage its powers to address retailers' underage sales of tobacco products has weakened efforts to curb the youth e-cigarette epidemic.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In this study, we compared design and materials of construction, electrical characteristics, liquid composition and nicotine and carbonyl emissions of new technology JUUL pods to their predecessors. Consistent with manufacturer's claims, we found that the new pods incorporated a different wicking material. However, we also found that the new pod design resulted in 50% greater nicotine emissions per puff than its predecessor, despite exhibiting unchanged liquid composition, device geometry and heating coil resistance. We found that when connected to the new technology pods, the JUUL power unit delivered a more consistent voltage to the heating coil. This behaviour suggests that the new coil-wick system resulted in better surface contact between the liquid and the temperature-regulated heating coil. Total carbonyl emissions did not differ across pod generations. That nicotine yields can be greatly altered with a simple substitution of wick material underscores the fragility of regulatory approaches that centre on product design rather than product performance specifications.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In the current study, we explored the marketing claims present in a sample of direct-mail oral nicotine advertisements sent to US consumers (March 2018-August 2020). METHODS: Direct-mail ads (n=50) were acquired from Mintel and dual-coded for the following claims: alternative to other tobacco products, ability to use anywhere, spit-free, smoke-free and product does not contain tobacco leaf. We merged the coded data with Mintel's volume estimate (number of mail pieces sent to consumers) and calculated the proportion of oral nicotine advertisements containing claims by category. RESULTS: Of the 38 million pieces of oral nicotine direct-mail sent to US consumers, most featured claims that the product could be used anywhere (84%, 31.8 million pieces); was an alternative to other tobacco products (69%, 26.1 million pieces); and did not contain tobacco leaf (eg, 'tobacco leaf-free', 'simple' approach of extracting nicotine from tobacco; 55%, 20.7 million pieces). A slightly smaller proportion contained claims that oral nicotine was 'spit-free' (52%, 19.8 million pieces) or 'smoke-free' (31%, 11.7 million pieces). CONCLUSION: Our results provide an early indication of marketing claims used to promote oral nicotine. The strategies documented, particularly the use of language to highlight oral nicotine is tobacco-free, may covey these products as lower-risk to consumers despite the lack of evidence or proper federal authorisation that oral nicotine products are a modified-risk tobacco product. Future research is needed to examine consumer perceptions of such claims.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study compared the cigarette cessation rates for ENDS, NRT and non-NRT medication. METHOD: Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study wave 3 cigarette-only users who used ENDS, NRT or non-NRT medication (varenicline and bupropion) to quit smoking between wave 3 and 4 were included. 'Cessation' was defined as being a former cigarette smoker in wave 4. χ2, logistic regression, and a sensitivity analysis with Bayes factor assessed the association between quitting smoking and method used. RESULTS: Among 6794 cigarette-only users, 532 used ENDS (n=75), NRT (n=289), non-NRT medication (n=68), or a combination of NRT and non-NRT medication (n=100) to quit smoking between wave 3 and 4. The percentages of quitting smoking among those who used ENDS, NRT, non-NRT medication, and a combination of NRT and non-NRT medication were 16.2% (n=14), 16.1% (n=47), 17.7% (n=13), and 14.8% (n=12), respectively (p=0.97). None of the cigarette-only users who used ENDS to quit smoking became ENDS-only users in wave 4; 37.6% became dual users of ENDS and cigarettes. CONCLUSION: No differences were found when cessation rates of ENDS, NRT or non-NRT medication were compared. Given uncertainty about the long-term health effect of ENDS and the likelihood of becoming dual users, people who smoke and need assistance quitting should be encouraged to use current Food and Drug Administration-approved cessation methods until more effective methods are developed.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

METHODS: We tracked online shopping queries for vape(s), JUUL and IQOS by analysing rates of Google queries indicative of shopping (eg, buy IQOS) after news of the outbreak was first reported (the week of 29 July 2019) until hospitalisations ceased (the week of 16 February 2020). We compared observed rates of shopping during the outbreak to counterfactual expected rates that were predicted using an autoregressive iterative moving average model fit to queries from 1 January 2014 to the week of 21 July 2019. RESULTS: During the outbreak, vape shopping queries were 34% (95% CI 30% to 38%) lower than expected and JUUL shopping queries were 39% (95% CI 34% to 45%) lower than expected, translating into about 7.2 and 1.0 million fewer searches. IQOS shopping queries were 58% (95% prediction interval (PI): 34-87) higher than expected, translating into 35 000 more searches. Moreover, IQOS shopping queries reached a historic high the week they were discussed as a potentially safe alternative to vaping (the week of 29 September 2019), when they were 382% (95% PI: 219-881) above expected rates for the week. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that unplanned events, such as the EVALI outbreak, can provoke changes in the epidemiology of product usage. Tobacco companies should be prohibited from using events such as disease outbreaks to position their products as less harmful without prior approval.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

These include electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), heated tobacco products (HTPs) and oral nicotine products (ONPs). Evolving over time, some of these products now deliver nicotine at levels comparable to cigarettes and may serve as effective substitutes for smokers. However, certain products, especially ENDS like JUUL, have also appealed to youth and non-smokers, prompting concerns about expanding nicotine use (and potentially nicotine addiction). The tobacco industry could shift away from primarily promoting cigarettes to promoting ENDS, HTPs and/or ONPs, though at this time it continues to heavily promote cigarettes in low and middle-income countries. Differing regulatory regimes may place upward and downward pressures on both cigarettes and these newer products in terms of population use, and may ultimately drive the extent to which cigarettes are or are not displaced by ENDS, HTPs and/or ONPs in the coming decade.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

This paper reviews recent commercial product offerings and the regulatory challenges associated with them. This includes electronic nicotine delivery systems, electronic non-nicotine delivery systems, personal vaporisers, heated tobacco products, nicotine salts, tobacco-free nicotine products, other nicotine products resembling nicotine replacement therapies, and various vitamin and cannabis products that share delivery devices or marketing channels with tobacco products. There is substantial variation in the availability of these tobacco, nicotine, vaporised, and related products globally, and policies regulating these products also vary substantially between countries. Many of these products avoid regulation by exploiting loopholes in the definition of tobacco or nicotine products, or by occupying a regulatory grey area where authority is unclear. These challenges will increase as the tobacco industry continues to diversify its product portfolio, and weaponises 'tobacco harm reduction' rhetoric to undermine policies limiting marketing, promotion and taxation of tobacco, nicotine and related products. Tobacco control policy often lags behind the evolution of the industry, which may continue to sell these products for years while regulations are established, refined or enforced. Policies that anticipate commercial tobacco, nicotine and related product and marketing changes and that are broad enough to cover these product developments are needed.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Evidence is also accumulating for positive campaign effects on interpersonal discussions, social norms and policy support that can help motivate and sustain quitting and reduce uptake. Research needs over the next decade centre on the rapidly changing media environment and the equity of campaign effects among high smoking prevalence communities. The field needs specific evidence on: how to measure total campaign reach and frequency across the diverse range of media platforms and channels; the optimum mix of traditional, digital and social media to achieve behaviour change, especially among high smoking prevalence communities; the relative reach and impact of the wide variety of integrated, digital and social media message delivery methods; the relative effectiveness of messages that aim to build capacity to quit and optimum methods for combining motivational and capacity-building messages, especially for high prevalence groups who face additional barriers to staying quit; the ongoing effectiveness of traditional versus new versions of messages highlighting tobacco industry practices; the influence of e-cigarette use on tobacco control campaign effects; and the effectiveness of different types of campaigns aiming to prevent e-cigarette uptake and motivate e-cigarette cessation. Research is also needed to investigate the potential for campaigns to influence the public's understanding and support for endgame tobacco control policies and for campaign elements that may influence the social and environmental contexts surrounding smokers that support and maintain behaviour change.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

It has been a decade since Australia became the first country to require tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging; after slow initial uptake, 16 countries have now fully implemented this policy. Since 2020, plain packaging laws have become more comprehensive in some countries, expanding coverage beyond traditional tobacco products to include heated tobacco, tobacco accessories (rolling papers) and other nicotine-containing products (e-cigarettes). Laws have also become more innovative: some now ban non-biodegradable filters, include provision for a periodic change of the pack colour or require both plain packaging and health-promoting pack inserts. The tobacco industry has and will continue to use multi-jurisdictional strategies to oppose this policy. Evaluations suggest that plain packaging has improved health outcomes and has not burdened retailers, although research is limited to early policy adopters and important gaps in the literature remain. While the power of packaging as a sales tool has diminished in markets with plain packaging, tobacco companies have exploited loopholes to continue to promote their products and have increasingly focused on filter innovations. Opportunities exist for governments to strengthen plain packaging laws.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

This paper explores the tactics used by the industry to subvert tobacco control policies in Oman and offers lessons on how to prevent such interference in the future. METHODS: We searched the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Archive using the word 'Oman', names of government institutions, policymakers and local tobacco distributors. Extracted data were noted chronologically by key elements of tobacco control measures. Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Health Ministers' Council resolutions on tobacco control were also reviewed. RESULTS: Out of 1020 tobacco documents located, 327 were closely related to policy interference. Documents revealed that the industry met key government officials, offered in-kind services, used local diplomatic missions to influence Omani policymakers, opposed smoking bans, delayed regulations to lower tar and nicotine content of cigarettes, and to require effective health warnings, circumvented a tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship ban and provided voluntary codes as an alternative to effective regulations. Additionally, industry representatives lobbied individual countries in the GCC to veto tax increments and defeat consensus on agreed resolutions of the Health Ministers' Council. CONCLUSION: The tobacco industry interfered in all key public health policies aimed to reduce tobacco use in Oman. There is an urgent need for the Omani government to enforce the Civil Code of Conduct and develop guidelines for all policymakers through implementing Article 5.3 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control to curb the tobacco epidemic.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

A search of the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents revealed that the industry considered using synthetic nicotine already in the 1960s, efforts that were abandoned due to high costs and insufficient purity. Recent patents revealed renewed efforts to develop more efficient strategies for the synthesis of nicotine. Nicotine exists as two stereoisomers, S-nicotine and R-nicotine. While S-nicotine is the prevalent (>99%) form of nicotine in tobacco, a market-leading form of synthetic nicotine contains both stereoisomers at equal amounts, raising concerns about inaccurate labelling and the poorly understood health effects of R-nicotine. Other manufacturers, including a leading vendor of pharmaceutical grade nicotine, developed stereospecific strategies to synthesise pure S-nicotine, now added to electronic cigarette products marketed in the USA and UK. While S-nicotine and R-nicotine can be differentiated by enantioselective High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), differentiation of synthetic (fossil-derived) from tobacco-derived S-nicotine will require development of methods to measure carbon isotope (14C or 13C) content. Vendors claim that the FDA has no authority to regulate synthetic nicotine as a tobacco product, allowing them to circumvent the premarket tobacco product application process. However, legal analysis suggests that FDA may have the authority to regulate synthetic nicotine as a drug. Alternatively, Congress needs to include nicotine from any source within the legal definition of tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of one document and six videos from these discussions, provided on the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency website, or upon request. RESULTS: The arguments most used by tobacco companies were related to claims that the use of e-cigarettes and HTPs is less harmful than conventional tobacco. Unions that support its commercialisation also argued that lifting the ban would prevent smuggling and guarantee their quality. On the other side, universities, medical and anti-tobacco institutions argued that such devices may have health risks, including the risk of inducing cigarette smoking. In 2009, most arguments belonged to the 'health' theme, while in 2018 and 2019 economic arguments and those related to morals and ethics were frequently used. CONCLUSIONS: Those that supported the commercialisation and marketing of e-cigarettes and HTPs first focused on arguments of harm reduction, while 10 years later the right to access and potential economic consequences also became common. Public health agents and academics must gather evidence to effectively respond to these arguments and discuss these policies, and must prepare themselves to use and respond to arguments related to moral and economic themes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

What characterises transformation and whether companies can or are transforming is unclear. Nevertheless, such claims are gaining traction. We critically investigated tobacco industry transformation by exploring the definition and criteria for evaluating transformation, and assessed whether transformation is occurring and feasible.Companies' transformation claims centre on increasing sales of new tobacco and nicotine products like e-cigarettes ('new products') with little attention to reducing sales of more hazardous smoked and oral products ('conventional products').We define a transforming tobacco company as one demonstrating substantial, rapid and verifiable progress towards eliminating the production and sale of conventional tobacco products within 5 years in all markets where it operates.We found no evidence any tobacco company is meeting the three essential criteria of rapidly progressing towards eliminating conventional products, ceasing to obstruct effective tobacco control measures and taking action to minimise smoking uptake and disparities. While some companies are developing new product portfolios, their actions are more consistent with profit maximisation than eliminating conventional product use. This approach is best described as 'pseudo-transformation', designed to delay implementation of effective tobacco control policies. In addition, our analysis suggests replacing conventional products with new nicotine products is unlikely to be a viable long-term business model.Public health practitioners should not rely on tobacco industry claims but should lead the transformation debate, establish credible definitions and criteria, and monitor and assess whether transformation is occurring.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study describes how tobacco companies influence policymaking in a highly regulated environment such as Singapore's, where there is a strong government commitment to Article 5.3. METHODS: Analysis of internal tobacco industry documents detailing the industry's lobbying activities in Singapore, retrieved via snowball searches in the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library. Subsequently, we conducted one-on-one interviews with key informants from sectors mentioned in the documents (academia, arts, government, public health, media, trade, education) to fill gaps in information and provide context to events described in the documents. RESULTS: In the 1980s and 1990s, tobacco companies observed that, to influence policy within Singapore's 'hostile' environment, they needed to use 'behind the scenes' tactics, targeting influential individuals at social functions or industry-sponsored events. Tobacco companies used arts and education sponsorships primarily for political purposes, to gain visibility with policymakers. Tobacco companies cultivated relationships with academic researchers and the media to avoid smoke-free legislation in the 1990s and, in the 2010s, appear to have used similar tactics to challenge Singapore's e-cigarette ban. CONCLUSIONS: Countries with a strong commitment to Article 5.3 should consider the tobacco industry's potential interference in policymaking beyond relationships in the government sector, particularly in academia, arts, education and the media, and the more subtle or indirect manners in which these relationships are built.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

To inform further regulatory efforts, it is important to understand tobacco industry strategies for FCVs. METHODS: Analysis of data from 65 patents and 179 internal tobacco industry documents, retrieved via snowball searches in Patsnap and the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library, describing tobacco industry developments related to FCVs. We used an inductive coding method to identify themes relating to FCV features or developments. RESULTS: Tobacco companies were developing FCVs since the 1960s, with little market success until the 2000s following the launch of Camel Crush, a brand which targeted millennials (in their teens or early 20s at the time). Tobacco companies have patented, but not yet marketed, FCVs with microcapsule surface coatings, adjustable or heat-triggered flavour release systems, airflow manipulation features, transparent filters to visualise flavour release, and various flavours and additives for capsules including nicotine/tobacco extracts for an on-demand nicotine hit. Tobacco companies developed FCVs purported to be reduced harm, although their own tests showed that FCVs have higher toxicant concentrations. They have also developed loose flavour capsule units designed to fit into cigarettes, packs, or recessed filters to enable users to customise cigarettes and circumvent tobacco flavour bans. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent tobacco companies from targeting young people and exploiting regulatory loopholes, regulations on tobacco products should ban flavours and consider the broad variety of FCV designs, additives and loose products designed to impart flavour into tobacco products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study regarding IQOS ad content (headlines, themes, images), ad occurrence characteristics (including content, media channels and adspend) in the USA from August 2019 to April 2021 using Numerator advertising/marketing data. RESULTS: Across 24 unique ads and 591 occurrences (84.6% online, 8.0% print, 7.4% mobile), there was $4 902 110 total adspend (98.9% allocated to print). Across unique ads, occurrences and adspend, prominent themes included 'real tobacco' (45.8%, 47.4%, 30.1%, respectively), less odour/ash (29.2%, 21.0%, 29.9%) and switching from cigarettes (25.0%, 19.5%, 69.4%), and images mainly featured the product alone (58.2%, 61.4%, 99.5%) or with women (25.0%, 19.1%, 0.3%). Per occurrences and adspend, the most prominent media channel themes (eg, magazine/website topics) were technology (19.3%, 10.6%), women's fashion (18.1%, 26.2%), weather/news (9.0%, 15.3%) and entertainment/pop culture/gaming (8.5%, 23.1%). Ad themes appearing only post-FDA authorisation included switching from traditional cigarettes, same-day/home-delivery, convenience (eg, use indoors), reduced exposure to some dangerous substances, science/research and distinction from e-cigarettes. Overall adspend per occurrence increased postauthorisation (p=0.016); the highest adspend per unique ad (69.3% of total) focused on ads featuring reduced exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Regulatory efforts must be informed by ongoing surveillance of IQOS marketing efforts and its impacts, particularly how specific consumer subgroups (eg, tobacco non-users, women, young people) are impacted by marketing exposure.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

While nicotine is recognised as the main addictive component in tobacco smoke, the total nicotine amount emitted (nicotine yield) and the rate of nicotine emission per second ('nicotine flux') contribute to the abuse liability of a given product. These variables can be regulated for public health ends and conveniently so for electronic cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). METHODS: In this study we computed nicotine flux from previously reported values of yield and puff topography for a wide range of tobacco products. RESULTS: We found that nicotine flux varied widely across tobacco products, from less than 0.1 µg/s to more than 100 µg/s, and that since 2015 the upper limit of the ENDS nicotine flux range has risen significantly and is now approaching that of combustible cigarettes. We also found that products that differ in nicotine flux may exhibit similar nicotine yields due to differences in user puffing behavior. Nicotine flux is a tool that can be used to regulate nicotine emissions of tobacco products, including ENDS.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study reports which variations in tobacco blend and design characteristics available on the market are likely to be perceived as different by consumers. METHODS: Truth Tobacco Industry Documents was reviewed for studies showing noticeable sensory differences resulting from variations in tobacco blend and design characteristics. These differences were compared with tobacco product data as available in the Dutch section of the European Common Entry Gate (EU-CEG) system on 30 April 2020. RESULTS: Industry documents identified discrimination thresholds for ventilation, pressure drop, tobacco weight, filter length, and tar and nicotine levels in smoke while evidence for other design characteristics was less conclusive. In the 103 different cigarette varieties in the EU-CEG database, five main types of cigarettes could be identified by principal component analysis, differing in (combinations of) design characteristics. The most significant differences between brand varieties were tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide emissions and associated parameters filter ventilation, filter length, cigarette length and tobacco weight. CONCLUSIONS: While some clusters of brand varieties provided a noticeably different product for consumers, in many cases design differences within these clusters did not exceed the expected discrimination threshold. This indicates that many products on the market are not discernibly different for consumers, and that proliferation of brand varieties has a non-sensory purpose, such as marketing. Policy makers should consider limiting available brand varieties and regulating design characteristics to reduce product appeal.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Although 50 of 53 countries in the WHO European Region are parties to the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC), smoking prevalence varies tremendously between European countries. While smoking rates are decreasing slowly, faster declines among smokers with a higher socioeconomic status are leading to growing inequalities in tobacco use. Governments in Europe increasingly formulate visions of 'tobacco-free' societies and it is encouraging that the European Commission aims to achieve a tobacco-free Europe in 2040 as part of its Europe's Beating Cancer Plan. While core WHO FCTC measures still have to be fully implemented in many European countries, some countries are implementing more advanced measures such as plain packaging, banning of characterising flavours from tobacco products, tobacco retailer licensing and extensions of smoking bans into spaces such as cars, outdoor areas and public streets. Remaining challenges include protecting tobacco control policymaking from tobacco industry interference, insufficient dedicated budget for scientific research and the need for Europe-wide monitoring data on use of tobacco and nicotine products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

E-cigarette tax schemas vary, in contrast to cigarette taxes in the USA that are levied almost exclusively as excise taxes per pack. Some states use excise taxes on liquid and containers, others ad valorem taxes on wholesale prices and others sales taxes. It is therefore difficult to understand the relative magnitudes of these e-cigarette taxes and the overall e-cigarette tax size relative to the cigarette tax size. OBJECTIVE: To create and publish a database of state and local quarterly e-cigarette taxes from 2010 to 2020, standardised as the rate per millilitre of fluid. METHODS: Using Universal Product Code-level e-cigarette sales from the NielsenIQ Retail Scanner Data along with e-cigarette product characteristics collected from internet searches and visits to e-cigarette retailers, we develop a method to standardise e-cigarette taxes as an equivalent average excise tax rate measured per millilitre of fluid. RESULTS: In 2020, the average American resided in a location with $3.08 in cigarette taxes and $0.34 in e-cigarette taxes (assuming 1 pack=0.7 fluid mL). CONCLUSIONS: The public availability of this state and local standardised e-cigarette tax data will allow tobacco control researchers to study the relationship between e-cigarette taxes and tobacco and related outcomes more effectively.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

OBJECTIVES: We used unsupervised machine learning to identify and characterise sale offers of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and associated products on Instagram. We examined types of sellers, geographic ENDS location and use of age verification. METHODS: Our methodology was composed of three phases: data collection, topic modelling and content analysis. We used data mining approaches to query hashtags related to ENDS product use among young adults to collect Instagram posts. For topic modelling, we applied an unsupervised machine learning approach to thematically categorise and identify topic clusters associated with selling activity. Content analysis was then used to characterise offers for sale of ENDS products. RESULTS: From 70 725 posts, we identified 3331 engaged in sale of ENDS products. Posts originated from 20 different countries and were roughly split between individual (46.3%) and retail sellers (43.4%), with linked online sellers (8.8%) representing a smaller volume. ENDS products most frequently offered for sale were flavoured e-liquids (53.0%) and vaping devices (20.5%). Online sellers offering flavoured e-liquids were less likely to use age verification at point of purchase (29% vs 64%) compared with other products. CONCLUSIONS: Instagram is a global venue for unregulated ENDS sales, including flavoured products, and access to websites lacking age verification. Such posts may violate Instagram's policies and US federal and state law, necessitating more robust review and enforcement to prevent ENDS uptake and access.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the included publications, 25% were published by Philip Morris International (PMI) affiliates or PMI-funded studies. PMI-sponsored publications on emissions, toxicology assessments and health effects were comparable in number to those reported by independent research, in contrast to publications on IQOS use, market trends and regulation. Data on nicotine yield, carbonyl emissions, other mainstream emissions, secondhand emissions and IQOS waste were compared between data sources to highlight agreement or disagreement between PMI-sponsored and independent research. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed agreement between the data sources on nicotine yield from IQOS under the same puffing conditions. Also, both sources agreed that IQOS emits significantly reduced levels of some emissions compared with combustible cigarettes. However, independent studies and examination of PMI's data showed significant increases in other emissions from and beyond the Food and Drug Administration's harmful and potentially harmful constituents list.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, health-related claims need to be used cautiously to avoid inaccuracies and attracting non-smokers. We used the live webchat service on the IQOS website to identify information and claims on the relative risks of IQOS made directly to potential consumers in different countries. METHODS: The study was promoted through authors' networks and conducted between 1 August and 30 November 2020. Participants collected webchat conversation responses to three queries regarding the safety of IQOS relative to cigarettes and e-cigarettes using step-by-step guidance and a predesigned form. Responses were analysed to identify health-related claims and information provided. RESULTS: 70 webchat attempts were recorded across 27 countries, 54 of which (in 22 countries) were successful webchat conversations. In 48 of these, one or more claims were used to indicate IQOS is safer than cigarettes, such as IQOS is smoke free, emits less harmful substances or reduces harm. Four conversations contained statements indicating IQOS is safer than e-cigarettes. Some statements provided were contradictory. Participant age was consistently requested on accessing the website, but tobacco/nicotine use was not. Other information provided included referral to the 2020 US Food and Drug Administration Modified Risk Tobacco Product decision, IQOS or Philip Morris International web pages and claims that IQOS is not risk free nor a cessation device. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of claims and information on the relative safety of IQOS were used in webchat communications. Response variation highlights that clearer regulation is needed to appropriately control corporate communications via live webchat services.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Countries across the region were relatively quick to adopt mandatory smoke-free workplace policies, but regional progress in other areas has been slower. In taxation, for example, Uruguay and Brazil have made considerable progress while Paraguay and Bolivia have relatively weak policies. More recently, the region is grappling with challenges regulating novel tobacco and nicotine products. Market share for flavor capsule cigarettes in Latin America is the highest in the world; electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products are, for the most part, dissimilarly regulated; and uptake of these emerging products by adolescents and young adults is on the rise. In examining the needs and challenges in the region, we conclude that the adoption of a strong regulatory framework based on the FCTC and its Protocols is needed to accelerate a positive public health impact. In particular, countries in the region need more consistent progress in implementing FCTC provisions while strengthening regulation of flavored tobacco products, electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products. Failing to do so threatens to undermine the progress Latin America has made in tobacco use prevention and control.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Cigarette use is especially high among males in many countries, while bidis are widely used in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and are very inexpensive. Smokeless tobacco use is a global problem, but the bulk of use is in South Asia and there is emerging promotion of newly developed tobacco and nicotine products across the region. With the transnational cigarette industry contributing a significant amount in taxes, the bidi industry employing millions of workers and many farmers engaged in tobacco farming, the industry is powerful and exploits this when countering proposed advancements in tobacco control policy. Despite industry interference and major challenges, this region has achieved remarkable successes in tobacco control, including large pictorial warnings that cover up to 80%-90% of the pack in some countries, stringent rules on depiction of tobacco in movies, bans on advertising and promotion, and smoke-free public places. Key challenges include increasing the tax component of retail prices and reducing tax concessions, regulating newly developed products and countering the aggressive tactics of the tobacco industry. Strategies to advance tobacco control in the region may also include standardised packaging of tobacco products, sustained mass media campaigns to warn the population of the harms of tobacco use and promote use of available cost-covered cessation services, and supply-side measures such as vendor licensing.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Instagram is the largest source of e-cigarette social media marketing, where influencers-for example, bloggers, brand ambassadors-post promotional materials. This study analysed the network of e-cigarette brands and influencers on Instagram, characterising the most central players in e-cigarette social media marketing. METHODS: We tracked influencers with public profiles on Instagram who posted promotional e-cigarette content in 2020, had over 1000 followers and high user engagement rate (ratio of likes and comments to followers) of 1%-25% per post. By conducting a social network analysis, we identified the most central (highly involved in promotional activities) influencers and e-cigarette brands. The number of the influencers' followers aged 13-17 years old and the age verification practices restricting youth access were also assessed. RESULTS: There is a highly interconnected network of engaging e-cigarette influencers (n=55) worldwide who collaborated with over 600 e-cigarette brands in 2020. The Asian and US influencers had five to six times more teenage followers compared with the European influencers. 75% of the influencers did not restrict youth access to their promotional content on Instagram. The brands Voopotech, Innokin, Geekvape, Lost Vape, Smok and Vaporesso collaborated with the largest number of influencers (mean n=20). CONCLUSIONS: It is important to understand associations among influencers and e-cigarette use behaviours, especially youth, to inform effective public health communication and potential policies that could regulate social media marketing sponsored by e-cigarette companies.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This paper reviews the background, chemistry, toxicology, marketing, user perceptions, use prevalence and policy implications of e-cigarette products with ice-hybrid flavours or non-menthol coolants. Scientific literature search supplemented with industry-generated and user-generated information found: (a) The tobacco industry has developed products containing synthetic coolants since 1974, (b) WS-3 and WS-23 are detected in mass-manufactured e-cigarettes (eg, PuffBar); (c) While safe for limited oral ingestion, inhalational toxicology and health effects from daily synthetic coolant exposure are unknown and merit scientific inquiry and attention from regulatory agencies; (d) Ice-hybrid flavours are marketed with themes incorporating fruitiness and/or coolness (eg, snow-covered raspberries); (e) WS-23/WS-3 concentrates also are sold as do-it-yourself additives, (f) Pharmacology research and user-generated and industry-generated information provide a premise to hypothesise that e-cigarette products with ice flavours or non-menthol cooling agents generate pleasant cooling sensations that mask nicotine's harshness while lacking certain aversive features of menthol-only products, (g) Adolescent and young adult use of e-cigarettes with ice-hybrid or other cooling flavours may be common and cross-sectionally associated with more frequent vaping and nicotine dependence in convenience samples. Evidence gaps in the epidemiology, toxicology, health effects and smoking cessation-promoting potential of using these products exist. E-cigarettes with ice flavours or synthetic coolants merit scientific and regulatory attention.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We examined commercial JUUL-related messages on Instagram to identify marketing appeals used to target users along the continuum of e-cigarette use; we mapped the appeals to existing theoretical marketing frameworks to better understand industry strategies. METHODS: Hashtag-based keyword rules were used to collect JUUL-related posts from the Instagram application programming interface, 1 March-13 November 2018. Posts were classified as commercial or non-commercial. A combination of machine learning methods, keyword algorithms and human coding were used to characterise message themes in commercial posts. RESULTS: Keyword filters captured 50 817 relevant posts and 41% were commercial. Among commercial posts, 91% contained recruitment/trial-based appeals (eg, combustible tobacco cessation; product sampling; giveaways) and 71% featured reinforcement/addiction-related appeals (eg, loyalty programmes). None of the commercial messages contained e-cigarette cessation-related appeals and less than 25% mentioned quitting combustible tobacco as a recruitment appeal. CONCLUSIONS: Instagram posts featuring e-cigarette related marketing can increase exposure to persuasive messages encouraging e-cigarette trial and use particularly among susceptible youth. Stronger regulations are needed to prevent exposure to social media marketing among young social media users.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We also found that 2019 YRBSS data from San Francisco, California cannot be used to evaluate the effect of the sales restriction on all flavoured tobacco products in San Francisco as the YRBSS data for this city were collected prior to enforcement of the sales restriction. For future studies, we suggest triangulating with corroborating sales, behavioural and qualitative data over time to assess the effects of tobacco control policies on youth tobacco use.

METHODS: Switching patterns and e-cigarette acceptability were assessed at week 6 among 64 black and Latinx menthol cigarette smokers who used JUUL menthol (n=39) or non-menthol e-cigarettes ((n=25), primarily mint or mango) as part of a randomised switching trial. RESULTS: No clear evidence of effects was found between menthol versus non-menthol e-cigarettes on use or subjective effects/acceptability, effect sizes for all comparisons were small (effect size=0.0-0.2), and Bayes factor ranged from 0.10 to 0.15. Specifically, 82.1% of participants who used menthol-flavoured e-cigarettes fully or partially switched to e-cigarettes compared with 88.0% of participants who used a non-menthol (p=0.75). Further, both groups demonstrated substantial reductions in cigarettes per day (menthol e-cigarettes: -8.5±10.4 vs non-menthol e-cigarettes: -8.8±5.8, p=0.87), comparable grams of e-liquid consumed (menthol e-cigarettes: 9.2±9.8 g vs non-menthol e-cigarettes: 11.0±11.0 g, p=0.47), and positive subjective effects, including 'just right' throat hit (menthol e-cigarettes: 70.7% vs non-menthol e-cigarettes: 66.7%, p=0.93) and flavour liking (menthol e-cigarettes: 75.6% vs non-menthol e-cigarettes: 66.7%, p=0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Both menthol and non-menthol e-cigarettes were associated with high rates of use and acceptability among menthol smokers. Findings require confirmation in a fully powered non-inferiority or equivalence study but provide preliminary evidence to inform regulatory action on menthol e-cigarettes that could slow youth initiation without impacting black and Latinx menthol cigarette smokers interested in switching to e-cigarettes.

To inform tobacco control communication efforts, we sought to understand what tobacco users call e-cigarette aerosols. METHODS: Participants were a national convenience sample of 1628 US adults who used e-cigarettes, cigarettes or both (dual users). In an online survey, conducted in spring 2021, participants described what 'people inhale and exhale when they vape', using an open-ended and then a closed-ended response scale. Participants then evaluated warning statements, randomly assigned to contain the term 'aerosol' or 'vapor' (eg, 'E-cigarette aerosol/vapor contains nicotine, which can lead to seizures'). RESULTS: In open-ended responses, tobacco users most commonly provided the terms 'vapor' (31%) and 'smoke' (23%) but rarely 'aerosol' (<1%). In closed-ended responses, the most commonly endorsed terms were again 'vapor' (57%) and 'smoke' (22%) but again infrequently 'aerosol' (2%). In closed-ended responses, use of the term 'vapor' was more common than other terms among people who were older; white; gay, lesbian or bisexual; college educated; or vape users only (all p<0.05). In the experiment, warnings using the terms 'aerosol' and 'vapor' were equally effective (all p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The public rarely uses the term 'aerosol' to describe e-cigarette output, potentially complicating educational efforts that use the term. Future studies should explore public knowledge and understanding of the terms 'aerosol' and the more popular 'vapor' to better inform vaping risk communication.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Current products pose unique challenges and opportunities for researchers and regulators. This commentary aims to highlight research gaps, particularly in toxicity research, and provide guidance on priority research questions for the tobacco regulatory community. Disposable flavoured ENDS have become the most popular device class among youth and may contain higher nicotine levels than JUUL devices. They also exhibit enhanced harmful and potentially harmful constituents production, contain elevated levels of synthetic coolants and pose environmental concerns. Synthetic nicotine and flavour capsules are innovations that have recently enabled the circumvention of Food and Drug Administration oversight. Coil-less ENDS offer the promise of delivering fewer toxicants due to the absence of heating coils, but initial studies show that these products exhibit similar toxicological profiles compared with JUULs. Each of these topic areas requires further research to understand and mitigate their impact on human health, especially their risks to young users.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,Yes,

This study examined the association between noticing e-cigarette advertising features and perceived product appeal among non-tobacco-using young adults. METHODS: A sample of non-tobacco-using young adults (ages 18-29 years; n=1993) completed an online survey in 2021. We content analysed visible features from 12 e-cigarette ads that represented commonly used e-cigarette brands. Participants viewed the ads and clicked on the areas of the ads that drew their attention. Participants reported e-cigarette product appeal for each ad, including ad liking, product curiosity and use interest. We used generalised estimating equations to examine within-person associations between noticing specific ad features and reporting each and any type of product appeal, adjusting for noticing other features and participant characteristics. RESULTS: Noticing people, discounts, non-tobacco (menthol and mint/fruit) flavours, positive experience claims or product images was positively associated with having any e-cigarette product appeal. Noticing discounts or mint/fruit flavours was also positively associated with e-cigarette use interest. In contrast, noticing nicotine warnings or smoking cessation claims was negatively associated with ad liking and product curiosity. CONCLUSIONS: Attention to several e-cigarette ad features (eg, people, discounts, non-tobacco flavours) was associated with increased e-cigarette product appeal, whereas attention to nicotine warnings and smoking cessation claims was associated with reduced appeal among non-tobacco-using young adults. Restricting appeal-promoting features while strengthening the effects of nicotine warnings and smoker-targeted claims in e-cigarette ads may potentially reduce e-cigarettes' overall appeal among this priority population.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Little is known about the promotional strategies and media channels used to advertise this ST category or the extent to which the marketing strategies differ from strategies used to promote 'conventional' smokeless products (eg, snuff). We describe the nature, timing of and expenditures related to conventional, snus and newer ST product advertising on print, broadcast and internet media. METHODS: Advertising expenditures were collected using Kantar Media's 'Stradegy' tool, which provides advertising data including dollars spent promoting specific products across various media channels, including print magazines and newspapers, broadcast television and radio, outdoor posters and billboards, and internet. We identified 306 smokeless products within Kantar database and collected ad expenditures retrospectively for January 2018-April 2020. Promotional expenditures were aggregated by product category, by month and by designated market area (DMA). RESULTS: Kantar data analysis returned 28 conventional ST, 22 oral nicotine and 3 snus products (53 total) advertised during the period of observation, with over $71 million spent collectively on ST promotion. Across categories, more advertising dollars were spent on conventional ST products (63%) than newer oral nicotine products (25%) or snus (12%). However, during the later 9-month period from August 2019 to April 2020, oral nicotine products accounted for the majority of monthly ad spending. Most ad spending was placed in the national market ($66.5 million), with Atlanta ($1.1 million), Houston ($1 million) and Las Vegas ($0.8 million) as the top three local DMAs for expenditures. DISCUSSION: Advertising expenditures for nicotine pouches have recently exceeded conventional ST product advertising and nicotine pouches are being promoted nationally. Marketing surveillance as well as understanding consumer appeal, perceptions and consumption are critical next steps in tracking potential uptake of these new products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study examined changes between prepriority enforcement (2018) and early postenforcement (February-June 2020) among adults on: ENDS flavours and devices used most often; location of last purchase of fruit/other-flavoured cartridges (covered under the enforcement priority); and smoking and vaping. METHODS: Prevalence estimates came from 1608 adult frequent (≥weekly) ENDS users (current smokers (n=1072), ex-smokers (n=536)) who participated in the 2018 and/or 2020 US ITC Smoking and Vaping Surveys. Transitions between flavours/devices and changes in smoking/vaping were assessed among baseline respondents who were followed up in 2020 (n=360). Respondents self-reported the ENDS device (disposable, cartridge/pod or tank) and the flavor that they used most often: (1) tobacco flavors (tobacco/tobacco-menthol mix) or unflavored; (2) menthol/mint; (3) fruit/other flavors. RESULTS: Compared to 2018, in the first 5 months of the 2020 enforcement priority, there were significant increases in the prevalence of fruit/other-flavoured cartridges (7.9% to 12.4%,p=0.026) and menthol/mint cartridges (7.1% to 13.0%, p<0.01) and decreases in tobacco-flavoured tanks (15.5% to 10.0%,p=0.002) and fruit/other-flavoured tanks (38.7% to 33.6%,p=0.038). Fewer than 10% of adults used disposables in 2018 and 2020. Among the cohort sample, the most pronounced transitions between flavours/devices occurred among those who used flavoured cartridges covered under the enforcement priority (54.6% switched to a flavour and/or device excluded from enforcement). There was an increase in purchasing fruit/other-flavoured cartridges online and a decrease in retail locations except for vape shops. Overall, there were few changes in smoking and vaping behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Between 2018 and the early phase of the FDA's 2020 enforcement priority, prevalence of menthol/mint and fruit/other-flavoured cartridges increased among adults. Half of vapers using cartridge flavours covered in the enforcement switched to other flavours and/or devices that were exempt, with the exception of disposables. The extent to which more comprehensive restrictions may be problematic for adults who prefer a range of ENDS flavours remains uncertain.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In May 2020, a state-wide restriction on flavoured e-cigarettes, except tobacco flavour, was passed. This study examines changes in nicotine product use behaviour among youth around the time of the state-wide vaping flavour restriction. METHODS: NYS data from the US International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project Youth Tobacco and E-cigarette Tobacco and Vaping Survey were analysed cross-sectionally from February 2020 (n=955), August 2020 (n=946), February 2021 (n=1030) and August 2021 (n=753). Online surveys were conducted among youth 16-19 years. Weighted descriptive statistics and regression models were used to describe changes in nicotine product use behaviour. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity and perceived family socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Significant decreases in past 30-day e-cigarette use (20%-11%), cigarette (7%-4%), and dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes (5%-2%) were observed over the 2-year period in NYS. Over 95% of vapers still reported using a non-tobacco-flavoured e-cigarette following the restriction, with fruit-flavoured being the most popular at each time point. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all NYS youth continued to vape flavours that were restricted in NYS. While youth past 30-day vaping prevalence decreased significantly from 2020 to 2021, increased flavour restriction compliance could result in an even greater decrease. Continuous monitoring is important to better understand perceptions, use patterns and access at the individual level, retail level and population level to inform future enforcement and restrictions.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This article focuses on the first century of the global tobacco epidemic and its current status, reviewing the current and projected future of the global tobacco epidemic and the steps that are in progress to end it. In the United States and many countries of Western Europe, tobacco consumption peaked during the 1960s and 1970s and declined as tobacco control programs were initiated, motivated by the evidence indicting smoking as a leading cause of disease. Despite this policy advancement and the subsequent reductions in tobacco consumption, the global tobacco epidemic continued to grow exponentially in the later years of the twentieth century, as the multinational companies sought new markets to replace those shrinking in high-income countries. In response, between 2000 and 2004, the World Health Organization developed its first public health treaty, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which entered into force in 2005. An accompanying package of interventions has been implemented. New approaches to tobacco control, including plain packaging and single representation of brands, have been implemented by Australia and Uruguay, respectively, but have been challenged by the tobacco industry.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Nicotine binds to nicotinic cholinergic receptors, facilitating neurotransmitter release and thereby mediating the complex actions of nicotine in tobacco users. Dopamine, glutamate, and gamma aminobutyric acid release are particularly important in the development of nicotine dependence, and corticotropin-releasing factor appears to contribute to nicotine withdrawal. Nicotine dependence is highly heritable. Genetic studies indicate roles for nicotinic receptor subtypes, as well as genes involved in neuroplasticity and learning, in development of dependence. Nicotine is primarily metabolized by CYP 2A6, and variability in rate of metabolism contributes to vulnerability to tobacco dependence, response to smoking cessation treatment, and lung cancer risk. Tobacco addiction is much more common in persons with mental illness and substance abuse disorders, representing a high proportion of current smokers. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches to tobacco addiction include nicotine replacement, bupropion, and varenicline, the latter a selective nicotine receptor partial agonist.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

The documents provide information that is not available from any other source and describe the history of industry activities over the past 50 years. The documents show that the tobacco industry has been engaged in deceiving policy makers and the public for decades. This paper begins with a brief history of the tobacco industry documents and describes the methodological challenges related to locating and analyzing an enormous number of poorly indexed documents. It provides an overview of selected important findings of document research conducted to date, including analyses of industry documents on nicotine and addiction, product design, marketing and promotion, passive smoke, and internal activities. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of tobacco document research for public health and the application of such research to fields other than tobacco control.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Heart and circulatory physiology,Electronic hookah (waterpipe) vaping reduces vascular endothelial function: the role of nicotine.,"Vaping has risen substantially in recent years, particularly among young adults. Electronic (e-) hookahs are a newer category of vaping devices touted as safer tobacco alternatives. Although e-hookah vaping acutely reduces endothelial function, the role of nicotine and the mechanisms by which it may impair endothelial function remain understudied. In a randomized crossover study, we investigated the acute effects of vaping e-hookah, with and without nicotine, as compared with sham on endothelial function assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), among 18 overtly healthy young adults. To determine the role of changes in circulating factors in plasma on endothelial cell function, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured with participants' plasma, and acetylcholine-stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production and basal reactive oxygen species (ROS) bioactivity were assessed. Plasma nicotine was measured before and after the sessions. E-hookah vaping with nicotine, which acutely increased heart rate (HR) by 8 ± 3 beats/min and mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 7 ± 2 mmHg (means ± SE; P < 0.05), decreased endothelial-dependent FMD by 1.57 ± 0.19%Δ (P = 0.001), indicating impairment in endothelial function. Vaping e-hookah without nicotine, which mildly increased hemodynamics (HR, 2 ± 2 beats/min and MAP 1 ± 1 mmHg; P = ns), did not significantly impair endothelial function. No changes were observed after sham vaping. HUVECs cultured with participants' plasma after versus before e-hookah vaping with nicotine, but not without nicotine or sham vaping, exhibited reductions in endothelial cell NO bioavailability and increases in ROS bioactivity (P < 0.05). Plasma nicotine concentrations increased after vaping e-hookah with nicotine (6.7 ± 1.8 ng/mL; P = 0.002), whereas no changes were observed after vaping e-hookah without nicotine or sham (P = ns). Acute e-hookah vaping induces endothelial dysfunction by impairing NO bioavailability associated with increased ROS production, and these effects are attributable to nicotine, not to nonnicotine constituents, present in the flavored e-liquid.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Despite safety claims heavily advertised by the hookah tobacco industry, acute e-hookah vaping induces in vivo endothelial dysfunction by impairing ex vivo NO bioavailability associated with increased ROS production. These effects are attributable to nicotine, not to nonnicotine constituents, present in the flavored e-liquid.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Lung cellular and molecular physiology,Pulmonary toxicity of e-cigarettes.,"Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes or e-cigs) are designed to heat and aerosolize mixtures of vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol, nicotine, and flavoring additives, thus delivering nicotine by inhalation in the absence of combustion. These devices were originally developed to facilitate smoking cessation and have been available in the United States for over a decade. Since 2010, e-cig use has expanded rapidly, especially among adolescents, despite a paucity of short- and long-term safety data. Patterns of use have shifted to include never smokers and many dual users of e-cigs and combustible tobacco products. Over the last several years, research into the potential toxicities of e-cig aerosols has grown exponentially. In the interim, regulatory policymakers across the world have struggled with how to regulate an increasingly diverse array of suppliers and products, against a backdrop of strong advocacy from users, manufacturers, and tobacco control experts. Herein we provide an updated review of the pulmonary toxicity profile of these devices, summarizing evidence from cell culture, animal models, and human subjects. We highlight the major gaps in our current understanding, emphasize the challenges confronting the scientific and regulatory communities, and identify areas that require more research in this important and rapidly evolving field.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

AIM: Review chemical compounds found exclusively in electronic cigarettes and describe their toxic effects, focusing on electronic-cigarette-only and dual electronic-cigarette and conventional cigarette users. DATA SOURCES: Literature search was carried out using PubMed. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Articles related exclusively to conventional and electronic cigarettes' chemical composition. Articles which reported to be financed from tobacco or electronic cigarettes industries, not reporting source of funding, not related to the chemical composition of electronic and conventional cigarettes and not relevant to tobacco research were excluded. METHODS AND RESULTS: Chemical compounds reported in the selected studies were tabulated using the Chemical Abstracts Service registry number for chemical substances information. A total of 50 chemical compounds were exclusively reported to be present in electronic cigarettes. Crucial health risks identified were: eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation, with almost 50% of incidence, an increment of 10% in cytotoxic effects, when compared to compounds in common with conventional cigarettes and around 11% of compounds with unknown effects to human health. LIMITATIONS: Articles reporting conflicts of interest. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Despite being considered as less harmful for human health, compounds found in electronic cigarettes are still a matter of research and their effects on health are yet unknown. The use of these devices is not recommended for first time users and it is considered hazardous for dual users.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Results from a Pragmatic Randomized Clinical Trial.,"INTRODUCTION: The 5As model is a standard component of most guidelines for tobacco treatment. Unfortunately, provider adherence to this model is modest. AIMS: Providing physicians with adjunctive tools to adhere to 5As guidelines may serve as a catalyst for brief advice delivery. METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial assessing the uptake and impact of free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) sampling versus standard care in primary care. Patients reported receipt of separate elements of the 5As model, assessed one month following a baseline visit. Analyses compared patients who recalled receipt of brief advice among those who received NRT vs. standard care. Additional analyses examined demographic predictors of receiving brief advice. RESULTS/FINDINGS: Medication sampling did not improve compliance with ask, advise, or assess. Receipt of ""assistance"" was significantly higher among NRT recipients (70%) (p ≤ 0.0001). The NRT sampling group was more likely to have received all components (p = 0.004). As age increased, being asked (p = 0.006), advised (p = 0.05), and assessed (p = 0.003) decreased. Non-Whites reported higher rates of assessment (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Provision of NRT sampling increased provider compliance with some elements of the brief advice model, thus enhancing the impact of cessation advice within primary care.

In Yunnan cigars, the content of nicotine and neophytadiene accounted for over 90% of the total VOC content. Nicotine was significantly positively correlated with neophytadiene and phytol. The cigars from four origins were clearly classified by the PCA of VOCs. Four region discrimination functions were established through the LDA of 14 compounds, and the validation accuracy was 100%. The sensory descriptors with the highest geometric mean were woody, roasted, fresh-sweet, bean, and scorched. Acetophenone, megastigmatrienone A, and thunbergene were positively correlated with multiple aroma descriptors, while nicotine was negatively correlated with multiple aroma descriptors.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

(b) What evidence is there that tobacco companies conspired to deliberately mislead the public about the health risks of smoking? (c) How were scientists involved in the cigarette controversy? (d) Have tobacco companies changed the way they do business since signing the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement? The tobacco companies knew and for most part accepted the evidence that cigarette smoking was a cause of cancer by the late 1950s. The documents also reveal that the tobacco companies helped manufacture the smoking controversy by funding scientific research that was intended to obfuscate and prolong the debate about smoking and health. Today, the tobacco companies acknowledge that smoking is a cause of disease, but they have not materially altered the way they do business. In our opinion, it is not sufficient for the tobacco industry to merely concede the obvious point that smoking is a cause of disease when it is evident that decades of misinformation has resulted in a public that is massively ignorant about the risks of smoking low-tar cigarettes, nicotine addiction, and secondhand smoke exposure. Public education efforts are still needed to correct these misperceptions along with government oversight to ensure that the industry is not permitted to mislead the public further. If the past 50 years have taught us anything, it is that the tobacco industry cannot be trusted to put the public's interest above their profits no matter what they say.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

To find potential mechanisms that would explain the increase in sidestream smoke toxicity over time, we analyzed unpublished research reports from Philip Morris Co. using the internal tobacco industry documents now available at the University of California San Francisco Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and other Web sites. Unpublished research from Philip Morris Tobacco Company shows that 4-(methylnitrosamino)-I-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a highly carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamine, can form in sidestream cigarette smoke after it has been released into ambient air. In experiments done between 1983 and 1997, Philip Morris scientists measured the concentration of NNK in sidestream smoke in a sealed stainless steel test chamber at initial particle concentrations of 24 mg/m(3) over the course of 6 to 18 h. They repeatedly showed that airborne NNK concentrations in sidestream cigarette smoke can increase by 50% to 200% per hour during the first 6 h after cigarettes are extinguished. Two experiments done in a real office showed that NNK concentrations increase for the first 2 h after cigarettes are extinguished. If NNK formation also occurs in the lower smoke concentrations observed in real smoking environments, these results suggest that nitrosation of nicotine and/or nicotine breakdown products in aging secondhand smoke is a significant contributor to nitrosamine exposure in humans.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

One hundred twelve male and female smokers participated in a parallel-arm study to determine whether the ad libitum smoking of menthol cigarettes results in differences in smoke constituent exposure biomarkers in blood and urine relative to those smoking nonmenthol cigarettes having similar machine-measured (Federal Trade Commission) yields of approximately 9 to 10 mg ""tar."" The study subjects were provided cigarettes of their preferred menthol or nonmenthol types prior to two 24-hour study intervals spaced one week apart. Carboxyhemoglobin levels were measured in blood samples drawn at midafternoon following the two 24-hour urine collection periods. Six urinary nicotine metabolites (nicotine, cotinine, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine and respective glucuronides) were determined as measures of nicotine intake, and urinary 4-(N-nitrosomethylamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) and its glucuronide were determined to assess exposure to the tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(N-nitrosomethylamino)-1-(3-pyridinyl)-1-butanone. Subjects' median blood carboxyhemoglobin values did not differ significantly between the cigarette types. Neither total urinary NNAL nor urinary nicotine equivalents exhibited statistically significant differences between the menthol and nonmenthol cigarette smokers. The present findings indicate that moderately heavy smokers of menthol and nonmenthol cigarettes of similar machine-generated smoke yield exhibit essentially identical levels of biomarkers of smoke constituent exposure. These results are consistent with the substantial majority of epidemiology studies to date that suggest the risks attending the smoking of menthol and nonmenthol cigarettes are similar.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, tapering using lower yield commercial cigarettes may not be effective in reducing nicotine or tar exposure due to compensatory smoking behavior. We examined the effects of gradual reduction of nicotine yield in commercial cigarettes on smoking behavior, with an assessment of nicotine intake and exposure to tobacco smoke toxins. METHODS: This 10-week longitudinal study of 20 smokers involved smoking the usual brand followed by different brands with progressively lower machine-determined yields, ranging from 0.9 to 0.1 mg nicotine, each smoked for 1 week. Subjects were followed for 4 weeks after returning to smoking the usual brand (or quitting). Smoking behaviors, biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure, and cardiovascular effects were measured. FINDINGS: Cotinine and other biomarkers of smoke exposure remained unchanged comparing the usual brand with the 0.4 mg nicotine brands. A 30% to 40% decrease in nicotine, carbon monoxide, and carcinogen exposure comparing 0.1 mg nicotine cigarettes with baseline was observed. Self-efficacy was significantly increased and dependence decreased after tapering. IMPLICATIONS: We confirm prior cross-sectional population and experimental studies showing complete compensation for cigarettes down to the 0.4 mg nicotine range. Nicotine and tobacco toxin exposure were substantially reduced while smoking 0.1 mg nicotine cigarettes. Our data suggest that the degree of nicotine dependence of smokers may be lowered with progressive yield tapering. Gradual tapering of smokers from regular to ultralow nicotine yield commercial cigarettes might facilitate smoking cessation and warrants future research.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The filters have different toxicant trapping efficiencies, and smoking stains reflect variations in smoking behavior. Presented herein are the results of a structured literature review that was done to identify cigarette filter-based assays that may serve as proxies for mouth-level exposure and assessing smoking methods. METHODS: A search of the published scientific literature and internal tobacco company documents from 1954 to 2009 was carried out. RESULTS: The literature search identified diverse schemes for assessing cigarette filters, including visual inspection and digital imaging of smoked-stained spent filters, and quantitative determinations for total particulate matter (TPM), nicotine, and solanesol. The results also showed that: (a) there are sufficient data to link filter-based chemical measures to standardized smoking machine-measured yields of tar and nicotine; (b) TPM eluted from filters or in chemical digest of filters can be used to estimate the efficiency of the filter for trapping smoke solids; (c) visual and digital inspection of spent filters is useful in finding indicators of variations in smoking behaviors; and (d) there is a correlation between solanesol and nicotine measured in filters and exposure biomarkers in smokers. CONCLUSIONS: The cigarette filter may prove useful in estimating smoking behaviors such as filter vent blocking and puffing intensity, and may have utility as proxy measures of mouth-level smoke exposure in clinical trials. Additional investigations are needed to compare the different proposed assay schemes and the assay results with measurements of human biomarker assays of smoke exposure.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Laboratory studies used for these evaluations and also for understanding tobacco smoke toxicology use machines to generate smoke. The goal of this review is to critically evaluate methods to assess human smoking behavior and replicate this in the laboratory. METHODS: Smoking behavior and smoking machine studies were identified using PubMed and publicly available databases for internal tobacco company documents. RESULTS: The smoking machine was developed to generate smoke to allow for comparing cigarette tar and nicotine yields. The intent was to infer relative human disease risk, but this concept was flawed because humans tailor their smoking to the product, and chemical yields and toxicologic effects change with different smoking profiles. Although smoking machines also allow for mechanistic assessments of smoking-related diseases, the interpretations also are limited. However, available methods to assess how humans puff could be used to provide better laboratory assessments, but these need to be validated. Separately, the contribution of smoke mouth-holding and inhalation to dose need to be assessed, because these parts of smoking are not captured by the smoking machine. Better comparisons of cigarettes might be done by tailoring human puff profiles to the product based on human studies and comparing results across regimens.

A nationwide strategy for progressive reduction of the nicotine content of cigarettes is a potential way to reduce the addictiveness of cigarettes, to prevent new smokers from becoming addicted, and to facilitate quitting in established smokers. We conducted a trial of progressive nicotine content tapering over 6 months to determine the effects on smoking behaviors and biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure and cardiovascular effects. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-five healthy smokers were randomly assigned to one of two groups. A research group smoked their usual brand of cigarettes followed by five types of research cigarettes with progressively lower nicotine content, each smoked for one month. A control group smoked their own brand of cigarettes for the same period of time. RESULTS: Nicotine intake, as indicated by plasma cotinine concentration, declined progressively as the nicotine content of cigarettes was reduced. Cigarette consumption and markers of exposure to carbon monoxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as cardiovascular biomarkers remained stable, whereas urinary 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) excretion decreased. No significant changes in biomarkers of exposure or cardiovascular effects were observed in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the proposition that the intake of nicotine from cigarettes of smokers can be substantially lowered without increasing exposure to other tobacco smoke toxins.

Our objectives were to analyze (i) the stability of NMR in plasma, saliva, and blood in various storage conditions, (ii) the relationship between NMRs derived from blood, plasma, saliva, and urine, and (iii) the reproducibility of plasma NMR in ad libitum cigarette smokers. METHODS: We analyzed data from four clinical studies. In studies 1 and 2, we assessed NMR stability in saliva and plasma samples at room temperature (~22°C) over 14 days and in blood at 4°C for up to 72 hours. In studies 2 and 3, we used Bland-Altman analysis to assess agreement between blood, plasma, saliva, and urine NMRs. In study 4, plasma NMR was measured on six occasions over 44 weeks in 43 ad libitum smokers. RESULTS: Reliability coefficients for stability tests of NMR in plasma and saliva at room temperature were 0.97 and 0.98, respectively, and 0.92 for blood at 4°C. Blood NMR agreed consistently with saliva and plasma NMRs but showed more variability in relation to urine NMR. The reliability coefficient for repeated plasma NMR measurements in smokers was 0.85. CONCLUSION: The NMR is stable in blood, plasma, and saliva at the conditions tested. Blood, plasma, and saliva NMRs are similar whereas urine NMR is a good proxy for these NMR measures. Plasma NMR was reproducible over time in smokers. IMPACT: One measurement may reliably estimate a smoker's NMR for use as an estimate of the rate of nicotine metabolism.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, a given cotinine level may not represent the same tobacco exposure; for example, African-Americans have higher cotinine levels than Caucasians after controlling for exposure. METHODS: Cotinine levels are determined by the amount of cotinine formation and the rate of cotinine removal, which are both mediated by the enzyme CYP2A6. Because CYP2A6 activity differs by sex (estrogen induces CYP2A6) and genotype, their effect on cotinine formation and removal was measured in nonsmoking Caucasians (Study 1, n = 181) infused with labeled nicotine and cotinine. The findings were then extended to ad libitum smokers (Study 2, n = 163). RESULTS: Study 1: Reduced CYP2A6 activity altered cotinine formation less than cotinine removal resulting in ratios of formation to removal of 1.31 and 1.12 in CYP2A6 reduced and normal metabolizers (P = 0.01), or 1.39 and 1.12 in males and females (P = 0.001), suggesting an overestimation of tobacco exposure in slower metabolizers. Study 2: Cotinine again overestimated tobacco and carcinogen exposure by 25% or more in CYP2A6 reduced metabolizers (≈2-fold between some genotypes) and in males. CONCLUSIONS: In people with slower relative to faster CYP2A6 activity, cotinine accumulates resulting in substantial differences in cotinine levels for a given tobacco exposure. IMPACT: Cotinine levels may be misleading when comparing those with differing CYP2A6 genotypes within a race, between races with differing frequencies of CYP2A6 gene variants (i.e., African-Americans have higher frequencies of reduced function variants contributing to their higher cotinine levels), or between the sexes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We investigated biomarkers of toxicant exposure with water pipe compared with cigarette smoking. METHODS: We conducted a crossover study to assess daily nicotine and carcinogen exposure with water pipe and cigarette smoking in 13 people who were experienced in using both products. RESULTS: When smoking an average of 3 water pipe sessions compared with smoking 11 cigarettes per day (cpd), water pipe use was associated with a significantly lower intake of nicotine, greater exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), and a different pattern of carcinogen exposure compared with cigarette smoking, with greater exposure to benzene, and high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), but less exposure to tobacco-specific nitrosamines, 1,3-butadiene, acrolein, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, ethylene oxide, and low molecular weight PAHs. CONCLUSIONS: A different pattern of carcinogen exposure might result in a different cancer risk profile between cigarette and water pipe smoking. Of particular concern is the risk of leukemia related to high levels of benzene exposure with water pipe use. IMPACT: Smoking tobacco in water pipes has gained popularity in the United States and around the world. Many believe that water pipe smoking is not addictive and less harmful than cigarette smoking. We provide data on toxicant exposure that will help guide regulation and public education regarding water pipe health risk.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

Two different approaches to nicotine reduction have been proposed: gradual and immediate. To determine if either of these approaches results in significant compensatory smoking behavior, which might lead to safety concerns, we performed a secondary analysis of data from studies that have utilized these two approaches. The number of cigarettes smoked per day, carbon monoxide exposure, and cotinine levels in plasma or urine were assessed while participants smoked reduced nicotine content cigarettes and compared with when they smoked their usual brand cigarettes. The results showed that in general, these two approaches led to minimal compensatory smoking and reduced levels of cotinine over the course of the experimental period, suggesting that neither of these approaches poses a major safety concern.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Many clinical trials on the effects and safety of nicotine reduction are ongoing. An important methodologic concern is noncompliance with reduced nicotine content cigarettes in the context of freely available conventional cigarettes. We propose two approaches using biomarkers to estimate noncompliance in smokers of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes in a clinical trial. METHODS: Data from 50 subjects in a study of gradual nicotine reduction were analyzed. Using plasma cotinine concentrations measured at baseline and while smoking VLNC cigarettes, we compared within-subject ratios of plasma cotinine comparing usual brand to VLNC in relation to nicotine content of these cigarettes. In another approach, we used nicotine pharmacokinetic data to estimate absolute plasma cotinine/cigarettes per day (CPD) threshold values for compliance based on the nicotine content of VLNC. RESULTS: The two approaches showed concordance, indicating at least 60% noncompliance with smoking VLNC. In a sensitivity analysis assuming extreme compensation and extreme values for nicotine metabolic parameters, noncompliance was still at least 40%, much higher than self-reported noncompliance. CONCLUSION: Biomarker analysis demonstrates a high degree of noncompliance with smoking VLNC cigarettes, indicating that smokers are supplementing these with conventional cigarettes. IMPACT: We propose a practical approach to assessing compliance with smoking VLNC in clinical trials of nicotine reduction.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR, 3HC/COT) is commonly used as a biomarker of CYP2A6 enzymatic activity, rate of nicotine metabolism, and total nicotine clearance; NMR is associated with numerous smoking phenotypes, including smoking cessation. Our objective was to investigate the impact of different measurement methods, at different sites, on plasma and urinary NMR measures from ad libitum smokers. METHODS: Plasma (n = 35) and urine (n = 35) samples were sent to eight different laboratories, which used similar and different methods of COT and 3HC measurements to derive the NMR. We used Bland-Altman analysis to assess agreement, and Pearson correlations to evaluate associations, between NMR measured by different methods. RESULTS: Measures of plasma NMR were in strong agreement between methods according to Bland-Altman analysis (ratios, 0.82-1.16) and were highly correlated (all Pearson r > 0.96, P < 0.0001). Measures of urinary NMR were in relatively weaker agreement (ratios 0.62-1.71) and less strongly correlated (Pearson r values of 0.66-0.98, P < 0.0001) between different methods. Plasma and urinary COT and 3HC concentrations, while weaker than NMR, also showed good agreement in plasma, which was better than that in urine, as was observed for NMR. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma is a very reliable biologic source for the determination of NMR, robust to differences in these analytical protocols or assessment site. IMPACT: Together this indicates a reduced need for differential interpretation of plasma NMR results based on the approach used, allowing for direct comparison of different studies.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Understanding factors that influence daily nicotine intake in AA smokers is an important step toward decreasing tobacco-related health disparities. One factor of interest is smoking topography, or the study of puffing behavior. AIMS: (i) to create a model using puff characteristics, nicotine dependence, and nicotine metabolism to predict daily nicotine exposure, and (ii) to compare puff characteristics and nicotine intake from two cigarettes smoked at different times to ensure the reliability of the puff characteristics included in our model. METHODS: Sixty AA smokers smoked their preferred brand of cigarette at two time points through a topography device. Plasma nicotine, expired CO, and changes in subjective measures were measured before and after each cigarette. Total nicotine equivalents (TNE) was measured from 24-hour urine collected during ad libitum smoking. RESULTS: In a model predicting daily nicotine exposure, total puff volume, CPD, sex, and menthol status were significant predictors (R(2) = 0.44, P < 0.001). Total puff volume was significantly greater and inter-puff intervals were significantly shorter after ad lib smoking compared with the first cigarette of the day, but puffing behaviors for both cigarettes were highly correlated (r range = 0.69-0.89, P < 0.001) within-subjects. CONCLUSION: This is the first study, to our knowledge, to show that puff characteristics of individual cigarettes are predictive of daily nicotine intake. IMPACT: These findings enhance our understanding of the relationship between smoking behavior and nicotine intake in AA smokers.

Biomarkers of exposure pertain to actual human exposure to chemicals arising from tobacco use and could play an important role across a number of FDA regulatory activities, including assessing new and modified-risk tobacco products and identifying and evaluating potential product standards. On August 3-4, 2015, FDA/CTP hosted a public workshop focused on biomarkers of exposure with participants from government, industry, academia, and other organizations. The workshop was divided into four sessions focused on: (i) approaches to evaluating and selecting biomarkers; (ii) biomarkers of exposure and relationship to disease risk; (iii) currently used biomarkers of exposure and biomarkers in development; and (iv) biomarkers of exposure and the assessment of smokeless tobacco and electronic nicotine delivery systems. This article synthesizes the main findings from the workshop and highlights research areas that could further strengthen the science around biomarkers of exposure and help determine their application in tobacco product regulation.

Smoking is a well-established cause of lung cancer and respiratory disease, in part through inflammation. It is plausible that e-cig use might affect similar inflammatory pathways. E-cigs are used by some smokers as an aid for quitting or smoking reduction, and by never smokers (e.g., adolescents and young adults). The relative effects for impacting disease risk may differ for these groups. Cell culture and experimental animal data indicate that e-cigs have the potential for inducing inflammation, albeit much less than smoking. Human studies show that e-cig use in smokers is associated with substantial reductions in blood or urinary biomarkers of tobacco toxicants when completely switching and somewhat for dual use. However, the extent to which these biomarkers are surrogates for potential lung toxicity remains unclear. The FDA now has regulatory authority over e-cigs and can regulate product and e-liquid design features, such as nicotine content and delivery, voltage, e-liquid formulations, and flavors. All of these factors may impact pulmonary toxicity. This review summarizes current data on pulmonary inflammation related to both smoking and e-cig use, with a focus on human lung biomarkers.

METHODS: We surveyed smokers in the NCI-sponsored Southern Community Cohort Study, consisting primarily of African-American, low-income adults. Seven items assessed attitudes toward aspects of precision smoking treatment, from undergoing tests to acting on results. Items were dichotomized as favorable (5 = strongly agree/4 = agree) versus less favorable (1 = strongly disagree/2 = disagree/3 = neutral); a summary score reflecting generalized attitudes was also computed. Multivariable logistic regression tested independent associations of motivation (precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation) and confidence in quitting (low, medium, and high) with generalized attitudes, controlling for sociodemographic factors and nicotine dependence. RESULTS: More than 70% of respondents endorsed favorable generalized attitudes toward precision medicine, with individual item favorability ranging from 64% to 83%. Smokers holding favorable generalized attitudes reported higher income and education (P < 0.05). Predicted probabilities of favorable generalized attitudes ranged from 63% to 75% across motivation levels [contemplation vs. precontemplation: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.10, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.36-3.25, P = 0.001; preparation vs. precontemplation: AOR = 1.83, 95% CI, 1.20-2.78, P = 0.005; contemplation vs. preparation: AOR = 1.15, 95% CI, 0.75-1.77, P = 0.52] and from 59% to 78% across confidence (medium vs. low: AOR = 1.91, 95% CI, 1.19-3.07, P = 0.007; high vs. low: AOR = 2.62, 95% CI, 1.68-4.10, P < 0.001; medium vs. high: AOR = 0.73, 95% CI, 0.48-1.11, P = 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: Among disproportionately burdened community smokers, most hold favorable attitudes toward precision smoking treatment. Individuals with lower motivation and confidence to quit may benefit from additional intervention to engage with precision smoking treatment. IMPACT: Predominantly favorable attitudes toward precision smoking treatment suggest promise for future research testing their effectiveness and implementation.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, one concern is that smokers may compensate by increasing the intensity with which they smoke each cigarette to obtain more nicotine. This study assessed whether smokers engage in compensatory smoking by estimating the mouth-level nicotine intake of low nicotine cigarettes smoked during a clinical trial. METHODS: Smokers were randomly assigned to receive cigarettes with one of five nicotine contents for 6 weeks. An additional group received a cigarette with the lowest nicotine content, but an increased tar yield. The obtained mouth-level nicotine intake from discarded cigarette butts for a subset of participants (51-70/group) was estimated using solanesol as described previously. A compensation index was calculated for each group to estimate the proportion of nicotine per cigarette recovered through changes in smoking intensity. RESULTS: There was no significant increase in smoking intensity for any of the reduced nicotine cigarettes as measured by the compensation index (an estimated 0.4% of the nicotine lost was recovered in the lowest nicotine group; 95% confidence interval, -0.1 to 1.2). There was a significant decrease in smoking intensity for very low nicotine content cigarettes with increased tar yield. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in nicotine content did not result in compensatory changes in how intensively participants smoked research cigarettes. IMPACT: Combined with data from clinical trials showing a reduction in cigarettes smoked per day, these data suggest that a reduction in nicotine content is unlikely to result in increased smoke exposure.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Clinical trials have been limited by non-study cigarette use (noncompliance), which could mask compensation. The goal of this study was to assess whether compensation occurs when smokers provided with very low nicotine cigarettes cannot access normal nicotine cigarettes. METHODS: In a within-subjects, crossover design, current smokers (n = 16) were confined to a hotel for two 4-night hotel stays during which they were only able to access the research cigarettes provided. The hotel stays offered normal nicotine cigarettes or very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes, in an unblinded design, available for ""purchase"" via a study bank. RESULTS: In the context of complete compliance with the study cigarettes (n = 16), there was not a significant increase during the VLNC condition for cigarettes smoked per day, expired carbon monoxide, or N-acetyl-S-(cyanoethyl)-l-cysteine (cyanoethyl-MA, metabolite of acrylonitrile). There was a significant nicotine × time interaction on urine N-acetyl-S-(3-hydroxypropyl)-l-cysteine (hydroxypropyl-MA, metabolite of acrolein), driven by an increase in the VLNC condition during the first 24 hours. By the end of the VLNC condition, there was no evidence of compensation across any measure of smoking or smoke exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Among current smokers who exclusively used VLNC cigarettes for 4 days, there was no significant compensatory smoking behavior. IMPACT: These data, combined with the larger body of work, suggest that a mandated reduction in nicotine content is unlikely to result in an increase in smoking behavior to obtain more nicotine.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,Yes,

However, understanding the biological impact of e-cigs compared with smoking on the lung is needed. There are major gaps in knowledge for chronic effects and for an etiology to recent acute lung toxicity leading to death among vapers. METHODS: We conducted bronchoscopies in a cross-sectional study of 73 subjects (42 never-smokers, 15 e-cig users, and 16 smokers). Using bronchoalveolar lavage and brushings, we examined lung inflammation by cell counts, cytokines, genome-wide gene expression, and DNA methylation. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences among never-smokers, e-cig users, and smokers for inflammatory cell counts and cytokines (FDR q < 0.1). The e-cig users had values intermediate between smokers and never-smokers, with levels for most of the biomarkers more similar to never-smokers. For differential gene expression and DNA methylation, e-cig users also more like never-smokers; many of these genes corresponded to smoking-related pathways, including those for xenobiotic metabolism, aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, and oxidative stress. Differentially methylated genes were correlated with changes in gene expression, providing evidence for biological effects of the methylation associations. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that e-cigs are associated with less toxicity than cigarettes for smoking-related pathways. What is unknown may be unique effects for e-cigs not measured herein, and a comparison of smokers completely switching to e-cigs compared with former smokers. Clinical trials for smokers switching to e-cigs who undergo serial bronchoscopy and larger cross-sectional studies of former smokers with and without e-cig use, and for e-cigs who relapse back to smoking, are needed. IMPACT: These data can be used for product regulation and for informing tobacco users considering or using e-cigs. What is unknown may be unique effects for e-cigs not measured herein, and clinical trials with serial bronchoscopy underway can demonstrate a direct relationship for changes in lung biomarkers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Typically light smokers, cessation interventions in AIs are generally less effective. To develop more effective cessation programs for AIs, clinicians, researchers, and public health workers need a better understanding of the genetic factors involved in their smoking behavior. Our aim was to assess whether SNPs associated with smoking behavior in NHWs are also associated with smoking in AIs. METHODS: We collected questionnaire data on smoking behaviors and analyzed blood and saliva samples from two Tribal populations with dramatically different cultures and smoking prevalence, one in the Northern Plains (n = 323) and the other in the Southwest (n = 176). A total of 384 SNPs were genotyped using an Illumina custom GoldenGate platform. Samples were also assessed for cotinine and 3-hydroxycotinine as markers of nicotine intake and nicotine metabolite ratio. RESULTS: Among 499 participants, we identified, in the Northern Plains sample only, a variant of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-2 (GABRA2) (rs2119767) on chromosome 4p that was associated with many of the intake biomarkers of smoking we examined, suggesting a role for this gene in modifying smoking behavior in this population. We also identified three SNPs, in the Southwest sample only, as significant correlates of only cigarettes per day: rs4274224, rs4245147 (both dopamine receptor D2 gene), and rs1386493 (tryptophan hydroxylase 2 gene). CONCLUSIONS: The contribution of many genes known to underlie smoking behaviors in NHWs may differ in AIs.

METHODS: Filter ventilation levels in cigarette brands were merged with Wave 1 (2013-2014) Population Assessment of Tobacco Use and Health study. Data were restricted to smokers who reported a usual brand and not regular users of other tobacco products. BOEs included nicotine, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, volatile organic compounds (VOC), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. BOPHs measured inflammation and oxidative stress. Perceived harm was assessed as self-reported risk of one's usual brand compared with other brands. RESULTS: Filter ventilation ranged from 0.2% to 61.1% (n = 1,503). Adjusted relationships between filter ventilation and BOE or BOPH were nonsignificant except for VOC N-acetyl-S-(phenyl)-L-cysteine (PHMA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). In pairwise comparisons, PHMA was higher in quartile (Q) 4 (4.23 vs. 3.36 pmol/mg; P = 0.0103) and Q3 (4.48 vs. 3.36 pmol/mg; P = 0.0038) versus Q1 of filter ventilation and hsCRP comparisons were nonsignificant. Adjusted odds of perceiving one's own brand as less harmful was 26.87 (95% confidence interval: 4.31-167.66), 12.55 (3.01-52.32), and 19.18 (3.87-95.02) times higher in the Q2, Q3, and Q4 of filter ventilation compared with Q1 (P = 0.0037). CONCLUSIONS: Filter ventilation was not associated with BOE or BOPH, yet smokers of higher ventilated cigarettes perceived their brand as less harmful than other brands compared with smokers of lower ventilated cigarettes.

Participants exclusively or concurrently used nicotine vaping products (NVP; Canada only), heated tobacco products (HTP; Japan only), and combustible cigarettes (CC; Japan and Canada) or abstained (Japan and Canada). RESULTS: All product groups showed substantial nicotine exposure. Both HTPs and NVPs exposed exclusive users to lower toxicant levels than exclusive CC use. Canadian participants who exclusively used NVPs exhibited lower NNK and acrolein exposure but higher acrylamide exposure than Japanese participants who exclusively used HTPs. Concurrent use of CCs alongside alternative products exposed users to higher toxicant levels compared with exclusive use of either alternative product. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive use of alternative tobacco products results in significant nicotine exposure but substantially lower toxicant exposure compared with exclusive CC use. People who use HTPs in Japan may experience higher exposure to nicotine and certain toxicants (NNK and acrolein) than people who use NVPs in Canada. Concurrent use results suggest that partially substituting CCs with alternative products may reduce toxicant exposure but to a lesser extent than completely transitioning to alternative products. IMPACT: Exposure patterns between two popular alternative tobacco products differ. The overall toxicant exposure from these products is lower than from CCs, providing critical data for regulatory decisions and public health considerations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In contrast, the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), specifically e-cigarettes, has grown to alarming rates and threatens to hinder progress against tobacco use. A major concern is ENDS use by youth and adults who never previously used tobacco. While ENDS emit fewer carcinogens than combustible tobacco, preliminary evidence links ENDS use to DNA damage and inflammation, key steps in cancer development. Furthermore, high levels of nicotine can also increase addiction, raise blood pressure, interfere with brain development, and suppress the immune system. The magnitude of long-term health risks will remain unknown until longitudinal studies are completed. ENDS have been billed as a promising tool for combustible tobacco cessation, but further evidence is needed to assess their potential efficacy for adults who smoke. Of concern, epidemiological studies estimate that approximately 15% to 42% of adults who use ENDS have never used another tobacco product, and another 36% to 54% ""dual use"" both ENDS and combustible tobacco. This policy statement details advances in science related to ENDS and calls for urgent action to end predatory practices of the tobacco industry and protect public health. Importantly, we call for an immediate ban on all non-tobacco-flavored ENDS products that contain natural or synthetic nicotine to reduce ENDS use by youth and adults who never previously used tobacco. Concurrently, evidence-based treatments to promote smoking cessation and prevent smoking relapse to reduce cancer incidence and improve public health remain top priorities for our organizations. We also recognize there is an urgent need for research to understand the relationship between ENDS and tobacco-related disparities.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

In a cross-over study, we measured 10 mercapturic acid metabolites of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in 24-hour urine samples collected from 36 dual users (8 women) of e-cigarettes and cigarettes during 2 days of ad libitum vaping or cigarette-only use, and 2 days of enforced abstention. Concentrations of VOC metabolites were higher during smoking compared with vaping, except for the methylating agents' metabolite. The fold-difference in concentrations when smoking relative to vaping ranged from 1.31 (1.06-1.61; geometric mean, 95% confidence interval; 1,3-butadiene) to 7.09 (5.88-8.54; acrylonitrile). Metabolites of acrylamide [fold difference of 1.21 (1.03-1.43)] and benzene [1.46 (1.13-1.90)] were higher during vaping compared with abstention. The 1,3-butadiene and propylene oxide metabolites were higher in variable-power tank users compared with users of cig-a-likes. E-cigarettes expose users to lower levels of toxic VOCs compared with cigarette smoking, supporting their harm reduction potential among smokers. However, some e-cigarettes expose users to VOCs such as acrylamide, benzene, and propylene oxide, and may pose health risks to nonsmoking users. The results of our study will inform regulators in assessing e-cigarettes with respect to the balance between its potential harm reduction for adult smokers and risk to nonsmoking users.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

The acute and chronic toxicity of e-cig use is unclear generally in the context of increasing reports of inflammatory-type pneumonia in some e-cig users. To assess lung effects of e-cigs without nicotine or flavors, we conducted a pilot study with serial bronchoscopies over 4 weeks in 30 never-smokers, randomized either to a 4-week intervention with the use of e-cigs containing only 50% propylene glycol (PG) and 50% vegetable glycerine or to a no-use control group. Compliance to the e-cig intervention was assessed by participants sending daily puff counts and by urinary PG. Inflammatory cell counts and cytokines were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids. Genome-wide expression, miRNA, and mRNA were determined from bronchial epithelial cells. There were no significant differences in changes of BAL inflammatory cell counts or cytokines between baseline and follow-up, comparing the control and e-cig groups. However, in the intervention but not the control group, change in urinary PG as a marker of e-cig use and inhalation was significantly correlated with change in cell counts (cell concentrations, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and cytokines (IL8, IL13, and TNFα), although the absolute magnitude of changes was small. There were no significant changes in mRNA or miRNA gene expression.

Many use e-cigarettes as an alternative or method to quit cigarette smoking, whereas others use these products recreationally. As technology has advanced, many individuals have reported symptoms of dependence on these products and continue to use them beyond achieving abstinence from smoking. Despite individuals reporting interest in quitting, little is known about e-cigarette cessation. This systematic review sought to identify and evaluate all human subjects literature published on the outcome of e-cigarette cessation through September 2021. Of the 79 articles identified, 56 were cross-sectional, 6 were qualitative, 5 were cohort studies, 3 were experimental, 2 were mixed methods, and 7 reported intervention or case studies of e-cigarette cessation. Results showed youth generally had high intent to quit e-cigarettes, whereas results were mixed with adult samples. Youth were motivated to quit e-cigarettes by health concerns, whereas adults were motivated to quit e-cigarettes by cost, lack of satisfaction, and psychologic factors. Adults were more likely to report past e-cigarette quit attempts, most commonly ""cold turkey."" Few interventions tested strategies for e-cigarette cessation, with a majority targeted for youth. Given the lack of information on e-cigarette cessation, recommendations for future studies are outlined.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

In this empirical study, we interview stakeholders in tobacco control to illuminate debates about the role of genomics in public health. METHODS: The authors performed open-ended interviews with 86 stakeholders from 5 areas of tobacco control: basic scientists, clinicians, tobacco prevention specialists, health payers, and pharmaceutical industry employees. Interviews were qualitatively analyzed using standard techniques. RESULTS: The central tension is between the hope that an expanding genomic knowledge base will improve prevention and smoking cessation therapies and the fear that genetic research might siphon resources away from traditional and proven public health programs. While showing strong support for traditional public health approaches to tobacco control, stakeholders recognize weaknesses, specifically the difficulty of countering the powerful voice of the tobacco industry when mounting public campaigns and the problem of individuals who are resistant to treatment and continue smoking. CONCLUSIONS: In order for genetic research to be effectively translated into efforts to minimize the harm of smoking-related disease, the views of key stakeholders must be voiced and disagreements reconciled. Effective translation requires honest evaluation of both the strengths and limitations of genetic approaches.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

While for some cultures it has been considered a crime, for others it has been invested with magical powers and even medicinal potential. In our century, society has come to realize the health risks associated with smoking. This has led to controversies between government and the tobacco industry as well as between physician and patient. In spite of their knowledge of its deadly consequences, many individuals are unable to stop smoking. The tenacity of this habit can be explained in terms of the various psychological motivations for smoking in combination with the physiologic addiction to nicotine. While some people are able to stop the habit, many relapse in spite of a variety of quitting methods. These range from the doctor's advice to stop, education programs, group and individual psychotherapies, behavioral techniques, hypnosis, and the use of nicotine gum. With a growing understanding of what distinguishes categories of smokers and with a new appreciation for the role of nicotine in addiction to smoking, more effective antismoking strategies can be fashioned to meet the specific needs of the potential quitter.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

The use of some types of these products, for instance, is associated with an increased mortality risk in those with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease.

The market of smokeless oral nicotine products has transformed since the last American Heart Association smokeless tobacco policy statement. Several varieties of tobacco-free oral nicotine products-including oral nicotine pouches; nontherapeutic nicotine gums, lozenges, and tablets; and nicotine gummies-have rapidly proliferated. The sales of oral nicotine pouches, in particular, have increased substantially; however, no data are available on their cardiovascular or health risks. In addition, synthetic (compared with tobacco-derived) nicotine has been used in some brands of oral nicotine products, but its cardiovascular and health effects have been inadequately studied.

The single-use cardiovascular effects of EC have been well studied but may not reflect effects of ad libitum use throughout the day. We aimed to compare the circadian hemodynamic effects as well as 24-hour biomarkers of oxidative stress, and platelet aggregation and inflammation, with ad libitum cigarette smoking (CS) versus EC versus no tobacco product use. Methods and Results Thirty-six healthy dual CS and EC users participated in a crossover study in a confined research setting. Circadian heart rate, blood pressure and plasma nicotine levels, 24-hour urinary catecholamines, 8-isoprostane and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2, and plasma interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 were compared in CS, EC, and no nicotine conditions. Over 24 hours, and during daytime, heart rate and blood pressure were higher in CS and EC compared with no tobacco product conditions (P<0.01). Heart rate on average was higher with CS versus EC. Urinary catecholamines, 8-isoprostane, and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 were not significantly different, but plasma IL-6 and IL-8 were higher with both CS and EC compared with no tobacco product (P<0.01). Conclusions CS and EC had similar 24-hour patterns of hemodynamic effects compared with no tobacco product, with a higher average heart rate with CS versus EC, and similar effects on biomarkers of inflammation. EC may pose some cardiovascular risk, particularly to smokers with underlying cardiovascular disease, but may also provide a harm reduction opportunity for smokers willing to switch entirely to EC.

However, e-hookahs deliver nicotine by creating an aerosol of fine and ultrafine particles and other oxidants that may reduce the bioavailability of nitric oxide and impair endothelial function secondary to formation of oxygen-derived free radicals. Methods and Results We examined the acute effects of e-hookah vaping on endothelial function, and the extent to which increased oxidative stress contributes to the vaping-induced vascular impairment. Twenty-six healthy young adult habitual hookah smokers were invited to vape a 30-minute e-hookah session to evaluate the impact on endothelial function measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). To test for oxidative stress mediation, plasma total antioxidant capacity levels were measured and the effect of e-hookah vaping on FMD was examined before and after intravenous infusion of the antioxidant ascorbic acid (n=11). Plasma nicotine and exhaled carbon monoxide levels were measured before and after the vaping session. Measurements were performed before and after sham-vaping control experiments (n=10). E-hookah vaping, which increased plasma nicotine (+4.93±0.92 ng/mL, P<0.001; mean±SE) with no changes in exhaled carbon monoxide (-0.15±0.17 ppm; P=0.479), increased mean arterial pressure (11±1 mm Hg, P<0.001) and acutely decreased FMD from 5.79±0.58% to 4.39±0.46% (P<0.001). Ascorbic acid infusion, which increased plasma total antioxidant capacity 5-fold, increased FMD at baseline (5.98±0.66% versus 9.46±0.87%, P<0.001), and prevented the acute FMD impairment by e-hookah vaping (9.46±0.87% versus 8.74±0.84%, P=0.002). All parameters were unchanged during sham studies. Conclusions E-hookah vaping has adverse effects on vascular function, likely mediated by oxidative stress, which overtime could accelerate development and progression of cardiovascular disease.

We studied their acute hemodynamic impact and chemical composition. METHODS: In participants (age 18-45 years) in the Cardiovascular Injury due to Tobacco Products 2.0 study (Boston, MA), we measured changes in blood pressure and heart rate following a structured use of participants' own e-cigarettes. We compared ""clear"" e-cigarette users (N=23) with non-""clear"" flavored e-cigarette users (N=111) and nonusers (N=73). We used gas chromatograph coupled with mass spectroscopy to characterize and quantify the presence of synthetic cooling agents (WS-3, WS-23), menthol, and nicotine, and other flavorants in 19 ""clear"" e-cigarettes. RESULTS: All ""clear"" e-liquids contained the synthetic cooling agents WS-23 and/or WS-3, 18/19 contained menthol, and 12/19 products contained other flavorants. JUUL e-liquids did not contain synthetic coolants. Baseline blood pressure and heart rate measures were similar between ""clear"" and non-""clear"" flavored e-cigarette users. Following acute use, ""clear"" e-cigarettes resulted in a greater increase in blood pressure and heart rate compared to both non-""clear"" flavored e-cigarette use and nonuse, which remained largely consistent in multivariable models. For sensitivity analysis of comparing ""clear"" users to the subgroup of JUUL non-""clear"" flavored users, the directions of associations were similar. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of synthetic cooling agents along with traditional flavorants in ""clear"" e-cigarette products available in the Massachusetts marketplace undermines the efficacy of the flavor ban. The potential that ""clear"" e-cigarettes induced more pronounced hemodynamic effects necessitates further study of the health impact of these products and synthetic cooling agents.

Whether midbrain dopamine function is associated with substance use frequency and severity or reward function in 20-24 year-olds remains a critical gap in knowledge. The authors collected neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI), a validated index of lifetime dopamine function in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmentum area (SN-VTA) complex, to characterize altered dopamine function. METHOD: Midbrain NM-MRI contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was acquired in 135 20-24 year-olds (105 women and 30 men). A composite measure of cumulative substance use was derived from factor analysis of lifetime alcohol intoxications, lifetime cannabis use, use of nicotine in heaviest month, number of classes of drugs used, and ever meeting DSM-5 criteria for a SUD. Trait reward function was assessed by self-report. RESULTS: Cumulative substance use was significantly positively associated with NM-MRI CNR in a large area of the bilateral SN-VTA complex, an effect which was driven by women (who comprised most of the sample) and by voxels with greater NM-MRI CNR, including the ventral tegmentum area. NM-MRI CNR was not associated with individual differences in trait reward function. CONCLUSIONS: History of substance use is associated with greater NM signal in NM-rich areas of the midbrain, especially in women.

Tobacco use in the United States has been associated with millions of cases of periodontal disease. Researchers have identified the role of combusted and noncombusted tobacco products in promoting cancers of the head and neck, leading to disease and premature death. Tobacco companies have moved increasingly toward so-called next-generation products (NGPs)-products that may emit fewer toxins than combustible forms of tobacco. Although NGPs may negatively affect the lungs and other bodily systems, they shift the injection site of nicotine from the lungs to the oral cavity and oral tissues. Because the long-term effects of NGPs are unknown, this tobacco marketing development has profound implications for oral disease. The US Food and Drug Administration exercises regulatory authority over tobacco products. The tobacco industry has avoided meaningful regulation of its products, especially smokeless forms. By publishing new research, oral health scientists can meaningfully shape the climate in which the administration's policy making occurs.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We assessed changes in annual receipt of and spending on cessation medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) among tobacco users with employer-sponsored health insurance from 2010 to 2017. METHODS: We analyzed data on 439 865 adult tobacco users in 2010 and 344 567 adult tobacco users in 2017 from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database. We used a negative binomial regression to estimate changes in receipt of cessation medication (number of fills and refills and days of supply). We used a generalized linear model to estimate spending (total, employers', and out of pocket). In both models, covariates included year, age, sex, residence, and type of health insurance plan. RESULTS: From 2010 to 2017, the percentage of adult tobacco users with employer-sponsored health insurance who received any cessation medication increased by 2.4%, from 15.7% to 16.1% (P < .001). Annual average number of fills and refills per user increased by 15.1%, from 2.5 to 2.9 (P < .001) and days of supply increased by 26.4%, from 81.9 to 103.5 (P < .001). The total annual average spending per user increased by 53.6%, from $286.40 to $440.00 (P < .001). Annual average out-of-pocket spending per user decreased by 70.9%, from $70.80 to $20.60 (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Use of smoking cessation medications is low among smokers covered by employer-sponsored health insurance.

This study assessed differences in advertising exposure to flavored tobacco products among adolescents in Massachusetts compared with adolescents in 4 neighboring states after passage of the Act. METHODS: We collected monthly cross-sectional survey data from April 2021 through August 2022 among a convenience sample of adolescents (aged 13-17 y) in Massachusetts and 4 control states: Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. We measured self-reported past-30-day exposure to advertising for flavored electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) products and flavored cigarettes or other tobacco products across 9 channels. RESULTS: After implementation of the Act, adolescents in Massachusetts, compared with adolescents in the 4 control states, reported significantly lower levels of exposure to advertisements for flavored e-cigarettes (convenience store: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66-0.96]; supermarket/grocery store: AOR = 0.66 [95% CI, 0.52-0.84]; gas station: AOR = 0.61 [95% CI, 0.51-0.75]) and flavored cigarette/other tobacco products (convenience store: AOR = 0.69 [95% CI, 0.57-0.83]; supermarket/grocery store: AOR = 0.63 [95% CI, 0.49-0.79]; gas station: AOR = 0.55 [95% CI, 0.45-0.66]) in retail channels, which were the intended targets of the Act. We found no significant differences in flavored tobacco product advertising exposure for non-retail channels (television, radio, posters/billboards, newspapers/magazines, social media, and streaming services/movies in a theater). CONCLUSIONS: Future research should further examine the effects of statewide flavored tobacco sales restrictions on the availability of and exposure to advertisements for flavored tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,Yes,

This study compared perceptions of a hypothetical menthol cigarette or flavored cigar (MC/FC) ban among Black and White adults who smoke menthol cigarettes. METHODS: Participants were a convenience sample of 2113 Black and 1087 White adults who smoke menthol cigarettes, collected through Amazon Mechanical Turk from July 2023 through January 2024. Participants reported opinions about an MC/FC ban, the likely public health outcomes, and a hypothetical impact of the ban on their smoking behavior. We used stepwise logistic regression to model factors associated with ban opposition or ambivalence. RESULTS: More than one-third of adults who smoke menthol cigarettes supported an MC/FC ban (37.2% Black vs 34.5% White; P = .13), but Black (vs White) adults who smoke menthol cigarettes were more likely to endorse the public health benefits of a ban, as assessed via agreement with 5 statements of US Food and Drug Administration rationale (mean [SD] number of statements endorsed, 3.0 [1.7] vs 2.4 [1.8]; P < .001). Smoking more cigarettes per day, believing that menthol cigarettes are more addictive or harder to quit than nonmenthol cigarettes, and intending to continue using nicotine under a ban increased the odds of opposition or ambivalence to the ban. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted outreach to those who consume predominantly menthol products and those who do not intend to quit nicotine could increase support of an MC/FC ban among adults who smoke menthol cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Baseline exposure was determined while all subjects smoked CC1. Subjects then were stratified for gender and cigarette consumption and randomized to 1 of 5 groups-EHCSS1, EHCSS2, CC1, CC2, or no smoking-and monitored for 8 days. Compared to baseline, biomarkers of exposure on day 8 decreased 53% to 93% (P < .0001) for EHCSS groups and 18% to 39% (P < .02) for CC2. Environmental tobacco smoke arising from the smoking activities of the different study groups was measured in the air of a separate smoking room over 1-hour periods. Concentrations of respirable suspended particulates in both EHCSS groups were about 90% lower than in the CC1 and CC2 groups, similar to the 95% reduction in the no-smoking group. CO was undetectable in the EHCSS and no-smoking groups. Results from this short-term clinical study indicate that switching from a conventional cigarette to a first-generation EHCSS reduces the generation of environmental tobacco smoke and can reduce the exposure to the measured, potentially harmful constituents in tobacco smoke if smokers do not compensate by numbers of cigarettes. The study design was found to be suitable for the evaluation of the exposure of adult smokers to the measured smoke constituents and to allow the differentiation of different cigarette designs.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Philip Morris International'],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

Such claims for sales in the USA now have to be based on a wide range of information, a key part of which will increasingly be data on safety and risk. One of the pathways to achieve marketing authorisation is to demonstrate substantial equivalence (SE) with benchmark products, called predicates. However, the regulations are insufficiently transparent with regard to: a) a rationale for the cut-off date for 'old' and 'new' products, and for exempting the former from regulation; b) the scientific validity and operation of SE; c) options for product labelling to circumvent SE; d) the experimental data required to support, and criteria to judge, a claim; and e) a strategy for risk assessment/management. Scientific problems related to the traditional animal methods used in respiratory disease and inhalation toxicology, and the use of quantitative comparators of toxicity, such as the No Observed Adverse Effect Level, are discussed. We review the advantages of relevant in vitro, mechanism-based, target tissue-oriented technologies, which an advisory report of the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences largely overlooked. These benefits include: a) the availability, for every major site in the respiratory tract, of organotypic human cell-based tissue culture systems, many of which are already being used by the industry; b) the accurate determination of concentrations of test materials received by target cells; c) methods for exposure to particulate and vapour phases of smoke, separately or combined; d) the ability to study tissue-specific biotransformation; and e) the use of modern, human-focused methodologies, unaffected by species differences. How data extrapolation, for risk assessment, from tissue culture to the whole animal, could be addressed, is also discussed. A cost (to animal welfare)-benefit (to society, including industry and consumers) analysis was conducted, taking into account the above information; the potential for animal suffering; the extensive data already available; the existence of other, less hazardous forms of nicotine delivery; the fact that much data will be generated solely for benchmarking; and that many smokers (especially nicotine-dependents) ignore health warnings. It is concluded that, in common with policies of several tobacco companies and countries, the use of laboratory animals for tobacco testing is very difficult, if not impossible, to justify. Instead, we propose and argue for an integrated testing scheme, starting with extensive chemical analysis of the ingredients and by-products associated with the use of tobacco products and their toxicity, followed by use of in vitro systems and early clinical studies (involving specific biomarkers) with weight-of-evidence assessments at each stage. Appropriate adjustment factors could be developed to enable concentration-response data obtained in vitro, with the other information generated by the strategy, to enable the FDA to meet its objectives. It is hoped that our intentionally provocative ideas will stimulate further debate on this contentious area of regulatory testing and public safety.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The third workshop (24-26 February 2020) summarised the key challenges and made recommendations concerning appropriate methods of test article generation and cell exposure from combustible cigarettes, HTPs and ENDS. Expert speakers provided their research, perspectives and recommendations for the three basic types of tobacco-related test articles: i) pad-collected material (PCM); ii) gas vapour phase (GVP); and iii) whole smoke/aerosol. These three types of samples can be tested individually, or the PCM and GVP can be combined. Whole smoke/aerosol can be bubbled through media or applied directly to cells at the air-liquid interface. Summaries of the speaker presentations and the recommendations developed by the workgroup are presented. Following discussion, the workshop concluded the following: that there needs to be greater standardisation in aerosol generation and collection processes; that methods for testing the NGPs need to be developed and/or optimised, since simply mirroring cigarette smoke testing approaches may be insufficient; that understanding and quantitating the applied dose is fundamental to the interpretation of data and conclusions from each study; and that whole smoke/aerosol approaches must be contextualised with regard to key information, including appropriate experimental controls, environmental conditioning, analytical monitoring, verification and performance criteria.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,"['Japan Tobacco', 'Philip Morris International']",None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

APPROACH: A qualitative study. SETTING: Oakland, California. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two African American older homeless-experienced smokers who were part of a longitudinal study on health and health-related outcomes (Health Outcomes of People Experiencing Homelessness in Older Middle Age Study). METHOD: We conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews with each participant to explore beliefs and attitudes toward tobacco use and cessation, barriers to smoking cessation, and attitudes toward current tobacco control strategies including raising cigarette prices, smoke-free policies, and graphic warning labels. We used a grounded theory approach to analyze the transcripts. RESULTS: Community social norms supportive of cigarette smoking and co-use of tobacco with other illicit substances were strong motivators of initiation and maintenance of tobacco use. Self-reported barriers to cessation included nicotine dependence, the experience of being homeless, fatalistic attitudes toward smoking cessation, substance use, and exposure to tobacco industry marketing. While participants were cognizant of current tobacco control policies and interventions for cessation, they felt that they were not specific enough for African Americans experiencing homelessness. Participants expressed strong support for strategies that de-normalized tobacco use and advertised the harmful effects of tobacco. CONCLUSION: Older African American homeless-experienced smokers face significant barriers to smoking cessation.

METHOD: Data from the discussion groups were coded and analyzed by three trained coders using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Stress relief emerged as the dominant theme connected with both cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Apart from stress, perceptions of and experiences with the products differed. E-cigarettes were commonly viewed as trendy and cool and participants often reported using them due to curiosity and popularity. Participants commonly compared e-cigarettes to cigarettes, noting benefits of e-cigarettes. Participants also noted more negative short and long-term health effects of cigarette use, and discussed generational differences between the two products. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study help address a dearth of research examining tobacco use among diverse groups of Latino youth. Findings indicate that despite differences in country of heritage, Latino youth are united by similar opinions about cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Additionally, they share cultural values and experiences which could be leveraged for tobacco control communications that cut across populations of Latino youth.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Because of the pharmacologic properties of nicotine and other constituents of smokeless tobacco, there is also concern that smokeless tobacco products may lead to cardiovascular diseases as well. The relatively few human population studies to date conflict with respect to whether smokeless tobacco use elevates cardiovascular risk factors or leads to cardiovascular disease or death from cardiovascular causes. Hemoglobin adducts to carcinogens present in smokeless tobacco products are measurable in the blood of smokeless tobacco users, indicating that smokeless-tobacco-related carcinogens circulate throughout the body. This prompts a concern that smokeless tobacco may increase risks of other cancers as well. The evidence to date from epidemiologic studies indicates no relationship between smokeless tobacco and bladder cancer, but there is suggestive evidence linking smokeless tobacco use to prostate cancer risk. Only single studies have been conducted of some cancers, and inconsistencies among studies of the same cancer site have been reported. Molecular epidemiologic studies may help identify markers of malignant transformation in smokeless tobacco users that may help in early intervention to prevent or ameliorate the consequences of oral cancer. Further studies are needed to determine more clearly the cardiovascular and non-oral cancer risks potentially associated with smokeless tobacco use.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Smokeless tobacco can be used to deliver psycho-active and dependence-producing levels of nicotine. Tolerance develops with repeated use, causing the user to increase nicotine dosing through increased use and/or switching to products with higher nicotine yields. Clinical signs of nicotine withdrawal develop upon cessation of use. Recent data show that smokeless tobacco products vary widely in their nicotine dosing capabilities. Low-dose products tend to be those commonly marketed toward, and used by, young people without previous smokeless tobacco experience. Many of these people develop dependence and switch to high-dose products. The present article discusses each of these qualities of smokeless tobacco in greater detail. The article also discusses qualities of smokeless tobacco that make it an effective nicotine delivery device that leads to addiction.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Exploiting the dreams of smokers to find cigarettes which would not harm them as much, tobacco manufacturers duped and lurred millions of people by making them believe such a product existed and encouraged them to take up ""light"" cigarettes, while they knew internally that these products were by no means less dangerous. Tobacco manufacturers also lurred public authorities by neglecting to share vital information on the way smokers do not behave like measuring machines and would compensate by drawing on their cigarettes according to their nicotine intake needs. Thus smoking machines utilised to measure tar and nicotine intake could never reflect the reality and would render the content information printed on packs of cigarette meaningless. Very few countries have banned the misleading descriptors such as ""light"". It is hoped that the FCTC which includes a provision on the use of descriptors will prevent the fraud being repeated in the rest of the world and especially in the countries of Africa.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The epidemic and the growing smoking crisis in Africa is a menace to the health of our continent, with significant socio-economic repercussions to follow in the coming years. Approximately 1.1 billion people around the world smoke, and between now and the year 2025, this number will most likely increase to 1.6 billion. By 2030, 10 million tobacco-related deaths will have occurred, and for the most part those deaths will be concentrated in developing countries. The tobacco industry clearly lies at the heart of the development of the tobacco pandemic in the 20th century. Specifically, cigarettes have made tobacco a massively consumed product, constantly expanding and opening up new markets; the day before yesterday it was men, yesterday it was women and youth, and today it is the developing world. The strategy is identical: increase sales, and do goat a price which puts a heavy burden on the population's health. The industries turn themselves towards developing countries, and namely Africa, in order to compensate for their losses in the markets of the Northern Hemisphere at a time when the demand in these countries is decreasing. The industry's cynical strategy targets Africa as its strongest potential market for development, counting on an estimated increase in consumption of 16% over the next decade, according to WHO's recent World Tobacco Atlas. The illegal importation of cigarettes is a practice which is growing more and more within African countries, with a well-structured African network for smuggling. Smuggled cigarettes are even more toxic with very elevated levels of nicotine and tar. Sponsorship as well as direct and indirect advertising are rapidly developing in all kinds of formats, with a proliferation of aggressive advertising messages targeting African populations with cynicism, manipulation, the complicity of smuggling in broad daylight, and disrespect for the law, while exploiting all of the themes which promote tobacco use to the target audiences (youth, women, the poorest groups). Everyday the tobacco industry recruits new African smokers to replace those who die. The future of the industry is represented by about 8 out of 10 people who began smoking before the age of 18 years old. It was imperative to establish a Tobacco Observatory in Francophone Africa (OTAF) in order to resituate the African tobacco situation, contribute to the development of the French-speaking nations in Africa, and to make known and increase awareness of its needs, its initiatives, and its actions across the world, and finally to effectively fight against tobacco and the industry's practices. One year after OTAF was established in Bamako thanks to the consolidated efforts of all its members and support of the French League against Cancer and the International Union against Cancer, OTAF OTAF is an independent entity whose mission is to gather, analyse and disseminate information on all aspects of tobacco with the objective of soliciting and supporting public health activities and interventions. It is a reference centre for Francophone Africa and a technical advisory group for the public authorities on tobacco issues. OTAF's work is counted upon to inform the public authorities on the most effective measures to use in the fight against tobacco. OTAF's duty is to promote activities which protect the health of young people and non-smokers, and communicate on the harmful effects of tobacco and the tobacco industry's practices. The goal is to organise a fight against tobacco based on solid, scientific data of the highest level of quality. OTAF is the only Francophone African surveillance organisation for monitoring the tobacco epidemic, and the practices, schemes and methods of the tobacco industry which are known to be dishonest Today, OTAF is a unique reference centre as far as the fight against tobacco is concerned in Francophone Africa. It is a partner in a number of projects with the French League against Cancer, the International Union against Cancer, and the International Union for Health Promotion and Education, among others. The success of OTAF has been crowned by a trophee having been awarded by WHO and an honorary degree signed by WHO's Director General.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

RESULTS: Our studies show that norbinaltorphimine, a selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist is a candidate novel non-stimulant ADHD treatment and that a combination of methylphenidate and naltrexone has abuse deterrent potential with therapeutic benefits for ADHD. Other studies showed transgenerational transmission of ADHD-associated behavioral traits and demonstrated that interactions between untreated ADHD and repeated mild traumatic brain injury produced behavioral traits not associated with either condition alone.

This study evaluated the association of discrete positive and negative emotions with interest in alternative tobacco products. METHOD: In 2013, 1,226 U.S. adult nonsmokers and current smokers viewed advertisements for moist snuff, snus, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) with various warning labels and then indicated their emotional responses in terms of anger, anxiety, sadness, guilt, disgust, discouragement, hope, and contentment. Outcomes were openness to using moist snuff, snus, and e-cigarettes in the future and interest in a free sample of each product. Data were analyzed in 2016. RESULTS: Hope was positively associated with openness and interest across all alternative tobacco products as was contentment for moist snuff and snus. Anger was negatively associated with openness to moist snuff and e-cigarettes, disgust negatively to moist snuff and snus, and anxiety negatively to e-cigarettes. Being a current smoker, ever trying a corresponding product, being male, and younger age were associated with greater openness to and interest in moist snuff and snus. For e-cigarettes, being a current smoker, ever trying e-cigarettes, and being female were associated with greater openness, and being a current smoker was associated with greater odds of selecting a free sample. CONCLUSIONS: Positive emotions, particularly hope, were consistently positively associated with interest in alternative tobacco products. Hope is widely used by tobacco and e-cigarette companies to advertise their products. Antitobacco messages should aim to lower hope associated with tobacco products but increase hope for cessation or life without tobacco.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The participants completed an anonymous questionnaire concerning their current and future smoking behavior, attitudes toward a cigarette advertising ban, general attitudes toward smoking, and smoking status of parents and siblings. Fifty-one percent of the smokers reported that they are not likely to be smoking in the future. Smokers were found to have less negative attitudes than never smokers. Seventh-grade students who admitted to being triers or smokers had less negative attitudes toward smoking than eleventh-grade students. Parent smoking had no impact on attitudes. However, if a sibling smoked, the respondents' attitudes toward smoking were less negative. Students appeared to be more aware of sport sponsorship than conventional advertising. Most never smokers favored a total cigarette advertising ban, versus only 35% of smokers. Results from this study suggest that intervention programs need to address nicotine addiction and be in place before grade seven. Investigations is further warranted in the shaping of attitudes toward smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

We conducted a systematic review of the primary literature assessing the cognitive performance effects of nicotine and assessed potential associations between tobacco and pharmaceutical industry affiliation and reported study conclusions. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, BIOSIS, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2009 and 2016 that: (1) were randomized controlled trials; (2) investigated the effects of nicotine on cognitive performance in a laboratory setting; (3) administered nicotine to healthy adults (18-60 years); and (4) included participants were nonsmokers or minimally deprived smokers (⩽2 hours of abstaining from smoking). Study disclosures and tobacco industry documents were reviewed to determine industry funding. RESULTS: Searches yielded 3,771 abstracts; 32 studies were included in the review. The majority of studies investigated the effects of nicotine on attention (n = 22). Nicotine had a non-uniform effect on attention: studies reported positive (41%; n = 9), mixed (41%; n = 9), and no effect (18%; n = 4). The majority of study authors had received prior tobacco industry funding (59%; n = 19), however over half of tobacco-industry funded authors did not report this (53%; n = 10). CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine does not appear to be associated with consistent cognitive performance effects. Although no association was found between reported outcomes and tobacco or pharmaceutical industry funding, findings likely underestimate the influence of industry funding due to strict inclusion criteria and incomplete data on pharmaceutical industry funding.

Before implementation, there were significant concerns from consumers, industry, and some in the scientific community about the potential negative impact of the TPD on people using e-cigarettes to remain abstinent from smoking. To date, there is limited evidence on how the TPD has affected consumers. This study aimed to add insight into how consumers perceived and experienced the regulations. METHODS: Qualitative data, collected between March 2018 and March 2019, relating to participant views of the TPD were extracted from 160 interviews/extended surveys of e-cigarette consumers as part of a wider study into e-cigarette use trajectories (ECtra study). Data were thematically analysed. RESULTS: Awareness of the TPD among consumers was not universal. Participants' smoking behaviour did not appear to be influenced by the legislation. Participants were reassured by manufacturing regulations and requirements for ingredients labels. Participants responded negatively to changes perceived to cause inconvenience and extra plastic waste. The product restrictions prompted some participants to purchase non-compliant products illegally, potentially putting their safety at risk. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette regulation should focus on ensuring product safety. Raising awareness of the TPD among consumers and smokers could be beneficial.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The tobacco industry is promoting these products as healthier alternatives to conventional cigarettes. METHODS: In this four-arm crossover study, we examined the acute effects of cigarette smoking, vaping IQOS, or vaping e-cigarettes (with or without nicotine) on hemodynamics, arterial stiffness, and small airways. Twenty subjects (10 male, 10 female), all occasional smokers, completed each study arm. There was at least a 48 h washout period before each test day. Arterial stiffness and peripheral and central hemodynamics were assessed using Mobil-O-Graph™ (I.E.M., Germany), whereas tremoFlo® c-100 (Thoracic Medical Systems Inc) was used to evaluate the effects on the small airways and resistance. RESULTS: Cigarettes, IQOS, e-cigarettes containing nicotine, and nicotine-free e-cigarettes had similar effects on peripheral and central hemodynamics as well as on arterial stiffness. We observed a significant increase in all parameters. However, only nicotine-containing products lead to increased bronchial obstruction, higher reactance, and a higher tidal volume. CONCLUSION: Therefore, we concluded that cigarettes, IQOS, and e-cigarettes have similar effects on hemodynamics. No differences were observed between the nicotine-containing and nicotine-free e-cigarettes. All nicotine-containing products also influence small airways. These findings suggest that e-cigarettes and HTPs are not healthier alternatives than conventional cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

At that time, OTC's smoke-free campaign was being vigorously opposed by publicans as well as the Irish tobacco industry. Their opposition had downplayed any effects of secondhand smoke on pub workers' health. As a researcher, I had published 46 peer-reviewed papers on the hazard, exposure, dose, risk, and control of secondhand smoke since 1980. In 1998, I had become a secondhand smoke consultant, assisting entities in the U.S. and abroad who were attempting to enact workplace smoking bans. In 2002, OTC's then Director, Tom Power, had contacted me to request my technical assistance to the Irish government in their campaign to enact a workplace smoking ban in Irish pubs. Accordingly, I asked for any local data that might aid me in my effort. He provided me with measurements of carbon monoxide from secondhand smoke in 14 Galway Pubs, performed by the Irish researcher Maurice Mulcahy in support of his Master's Thesis. Using a pharmacokinetic model that enabled mapping secondhand smoke carbon monoxide to its equivalent nicotine metabolite body fluid cotinine, I estimated that based on the Galway pub data, secondhand smoke exposures of nonsmoking Irish pub workers were at the upper extreme for nonsmokers when compared to a study of cotinine in London pub staff relative to the general population. Further, using a dose-response relationship, I was able to estimate that the working-lifetime risk of mortality from workplace secondhand smoke exposure would produce an estimated 150 deaths per year among the ∼28,000 full-time Irish pub workers. I presented this information to the Health Minister and Members of Parliament at the Dail, and in numerous multi-media interviews. These estimates rebutted bogus tobacco industry assertions that ventilation could control secondhand smoke, fired up the effort championed by Health Minister Micheál Martin to ban smoking in pubs, and helped to protect pub workers from being forced to trade their health for a pay cheque.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Prevention is important for achieving this goal. We compare the Nordic countries' preventive tobacco policies, discuss the possible determinants for similarities and differences in policy implementation, and provide strategies for strengthening tobacco prevention. METHODS: We used the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) to identify the key policies for this narrative review. We focused on Articles 6, 8, 9, 11, 13 and 16 of the WHO FCTC, and assessed the status of the required (core) and recommended (advanced) policies and their application to novel tobacco and nicotine products. Information on the implementation of strategies, acts and regulations were searched from global and national tobacco control databases, websites and scientific articles via PubMed and MEDLINE. RESULTS: The WHO FCTC and European regulations have ensured that the core policies are mostly in place, but also contributed to the shared deficiencies that are seen especially in the regulations on smokeless tobacco and novel products. Strong national tobacco control actors have facilitated countries to implement some advanced policies - even as the first countries in the world: point-of-sale display bans (Iceland), outdoor smoking bans (Sweden), flavour bans on electronic cigarettes (Finland), plain packaging (Norway), and plain packaging on electronic cigarettes (Denmark). CONCLUSIONS: Collaboration and participation in reinforcing the European regulations, resources for national networking between tobacco control actors, and national regulations to provide protection from the tobacco industry's interference are needed to strengthen comprehensive implementation of tobacco policies in the Nordic countries.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

These might replace or come in addition to the more harmful cigarettes that historically have dominated the nicotine market in the Nordic countries. The authorities in each country must decide whether the products should have market access and, in that case, how strictly they should be regulated. Our aim is to present a framework that can assist the health authorities to make a regulation where benefits will outweigh the harms. METHOD: In a public health perspective, health gains from substitution must be weighed against the health loss from additional use. The main elements of the weighing will be based on the information about the absolute risk of the products, their relative risk compared to conventional cigarettes and how the users are composed according to smoking status. We apply the framework on snus as used in Norway - a product with an established usage pattern and epidemiologically assessed health risks. RESULTS: The framework consists of (i) a comprehensive set of specific user patterns that may result in health deterioration and user patterns that may result in health benefits, (ii) an estimation of the number of people with health-augmenting and health-impairing user patterns, respectively, and (iii) an estimation of the degree of health deterioration or health benefit that will affect the persons with the different user patterns. CONCLUSION: The net effect on public health will appear as an overall result of the number of people with positive and negative user patterns, respectively, in combination with the magnitude of the change in health status these people will experience. The use of an explicit framework highlights how a political decision may affect nicotine use and health-related outcomes. The framework breaks open a large and complex question into smaller pieces and requires the authorities to expose and explain the kind of evidence and reasoning behind regulations of novel nicotine products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Smokers often perceive that tobacco helps them cope with stress and aids their mental alertness. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms are one important factor preventing many smoker from quitting (only about 3% succeed with each unaided quit attempt). A number of policies are suggested to reduce the health consequences of smoking more quickly than at present. These include (a) banning all tobacco advertising and prosecuting retailers who sell illegally to children, in order to reduce the number of young people becoming addicted, (b) increasing the real price of tobacco in order to encourage more people to try to stop smoking, (c) providing specialist smokers' clinics in every large general hospital in order to assist highly motivated but addicted smokers to quit and (d) increasing the rate at which tobacco manufacturers must reduce permissible tar and carbon monoxide yields, such that in 20 years time only nicotine delivery products which are free of tar and carbon monoxide will be allowed.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Retail settings are major channels for the tobacco industry to market commercial tobacco products. However, few studies have examined marketing strategies on Tribal lands. The resulting evidence is important, especially given that American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth and adults have the highest smoking prevalence of any racial/ethnic group in the United States. In this study, we examined cigarette, e-cigarette, and vape/vaporizer availability, advertising, and price-reducing promotions in retail settings on and within a 1-mile radius of Tribal lands in California. Method. Trained AI/AN community health representatives (n = 8) conducted store observations (n = 96) using a checklist adapted from the Standardized Tobacco Assessment for Retail Settings observation tool. Chi-square analyses were performed to look for potential differences in availability, exterior advertising, and price promotions for cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and vapes between stores. Results. All stores sold cigarettes and over 95% sold menthol cigarettes. Nearly 25% of stores on Tribal lands were located inside a casino, and 40.4% of stores on Tribal lands offered a Tribal member discount. Stores within a 1-mile radius of Tribal lands sold significantly (p < .01) more e-cigarettes (69.8%), including flavored e-cigarettes (53.4%), compared to stores on Tribal lands (37.7% and 28.3%, respectively). Price promotions for cigarettes were significantly (p < .01) more common in stores located within a 1-mile radius of Tribal lands (46.5%) than stores on Tribal lands (22.6%). Discussion. To our knowledge, this study is the first to use store observations to examine cigarette and e-cigarette availability, advertising, and price promotions in retail settings on and near California Tribal lands. We recommend future studies build on our initial efforts to take an AI/AN Tribal community-engaged approach in assessing and documenting tobacco marketing practices on and near Tribal lands.

To engage today's young people, tobacco control programs need to draw connections between youth's identities, top issues, and tobacco. UpRISE is a social justice youth tobacco control movement that engages diverse youth in identifying the root causes of youth nicotine use. In 2018-2019, 21 youth-serving organizations and schools hosted youth coalitions. Coalitions engaged in a six-session workbook called ""Getting to the root cause,"" and adults were provided training and reflective supervision. Pre/post surveys with youth participants (n = 180) and end-of-year interviews with adult facilitators (n = 22) were used to assess outcomes. The primary outcomes were supportive adult relationships, youth voice in decision-making, anti-tobacco industry attitudes and beliefs, psychological empowerment, critical consciousness, and global belief in a just world. Quantitative measures of supportive adult relationships, youth voice in decision-making, psychological empowerment, and anti-tobacco industry attitudes and beliefs all increased significantly over time (p < .0001, p < .0001, p < .0001, p = .0034, respectively). Critical consciousness and global belief in a just world did not change significantly. During interviews, adults reported learning how: to engage in youth-adult partnerships, the tobacco industry abused its power, to engage in critical reflection about power. Adults also felt empowered. UpRISE may be a promising approach to increase racially diverse youth's engagement in social justice-oriented tobacco control efforts that advance equity.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study aimed to examine the associations between exposure to e-cigarette advertisements and perception, interest, and use of e-cigarettes among US middle school and high school students. METHODS: Data from the 2014 cross-sectional National Youth Tobacco Survey were used. Logistic regressions were conducted to model four outcomes, including perception of reduced harmfulness compared to regular cigarettes, perception of reduced addictiveness, intention to use, and current use of e-cigarettes. Main predictors were exposure to e-cigarette advertisements via four sources, including Internet, newspaper/magazines, retail stores, and TV. RESULTS: When all the four sources of e-cigarette advertisements exposure were evaluated jointly, exposure via the Internet was associated with elevated likelihood of reporting all four outcomes related to e-cigarettes, while exposure via retail stores was associated with higher likelihood of current e-cigarette use and perception of reduced harmfulness of e-cigarettes compared to regular cigarettes ( p < .05). However, exposure via newspaper/magazines and TV was associated with lower likelihood of perceiving e-cigarettes to be less harmful or addictive ( p < .05). CONCLUSION: Exposure to e-cigarette advertisements via the Internet and retail stores may play a significant role in adolescents' use and perception of e-cigarettes. The results call for more research on the influence of different sources of advertising exposure on e-cigarette use to help public health programmes curtail the fast growing use of e-cigarette products among youth.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In this article, we aim to examine key developments in e-cigarette policy that may have contributed to high uptake among young people in New Zealand between 2015 and 2024. By identifying key policy-relevant documents by government agencies and interactions with the industry, we aim to offer insights for jurisdictions looking to implement or strengthen e-cigarette policies. METHODS: We searched publicly available New Zealand government websites to identify documents related to e-cigarette policy between 2015 and 2024 (Ministry of Health, New Zealand Parliament, Beehive, Courts of New Zealand and New Zealand Customs). We included key policy-related documents for analysis. Documents were organised and summarised sequentially into a timeline graphic and chronological narrative results. RESULTS: New Zealand introduced policies aimed at reducing youth e-cigarette uptake slowly compared to other high-income countries such as the UK and Australia. When policies were introduced, they lacked strength, which enabled the e-cigarette and tobacco industry to oppose, bypass and, ultimately, weaken the impact of such policies. The e-cigarette industry had multiple interactions with public health actors that may have positioned the industry as a legitimate partner in tobacco harm reduction. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that jurisdictions must move quickly to introduce effective measures on e-cigarettes to protect health. Policies must be sufficiently comprehensive to prevent the industry from opposing and bypassing laws. Governments must protect policy processes from companies that profit from nicotine addiction in line with the WHO Framework on Tobacco Control.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In the absence of established facilities for tobacco cessation in the country, ECs may provide an additional opportunity for the industry to project itself as a harm-reduction crusader. Regulating ECs as tobacco products or as drugs is not a prudent option in the Indian context. Banning ECs seems to be the most plausible approach at present. However, in the long run, India should be open to new research. More significantly, policy makers in India should be wary of the lead time before a ban is implemented-a shorter intervening period could ensure that a well-established, better politically connected and more defiant EC industry, aggressively promoting ECs to Indian youth, never becomes a reality.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

It highlights knowledge gained from involvement in over 70 legal cases between smokers and cigarette companies in the Florida Engle Trials. As a physician with many years of experience in treating nicotine addiction, the author participated as a paid expert witness in these cases, 45 of which went to trial. Depositions included family members and close associates of the smoker, which allowed the gathering of voluminous information not usually available to a physician. This provided a level of insight into the suffering experienced that was illuminating. Based on this experience as an expert witness, 3 cases are presented that are clear examples of the tragedy experienced by smokers and their families. While not randomly selected, they are representative of the cases in which I participated. The impact of cigarettes on both smokers and those around them is difficult to quantify and is often not observable by healthcare professionals. The documented attitudes of cigarette lawyers, as seen in depositions and at trials, demonstrate an incredible lack of empathy and compassion. On the other hand, the cigarette companies are completely aware that almost 500 000 Americans die each year from use of their products, but death is only 1 outcome. What a sad commentary on the companies that knowingly perpetuated this epidemic and the lawyers who continue to defend them. Sadly, to both parties, it isn't about the pain, suffering, morbidity, and death that these products cause. Rather, it is simply about money and staying in business on the one hand and money and winning on the other. However, the paramount lesson learned for all of us who take care of smoking patients is first to help them stop smoking and second to appreciate the wide-reaching ramifications of their tobacco dependence. Taking this empathic approach to their care will go a long way to demonstrating the compassion that is needed to provide a healing environment for the patient, their family, and loved ones.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

Unless current tobacco smoking patterns in industrialised and non-industrialised countries change, cigarettes will kill prematurely 10 million people a year by 2025. Greece is at the top of the list of European countries in cigarette consumption. In 1997, a Greek tobacco company introduced a new 'bio-filter' (BF) claiming that it reduces substantially the risks of smoking. In a recent publication [Deliconstantinos G, Villiotou V, Stavrides J. Scavenging effects of hemoglobin and related heme containing compounds on nitric oxide, reactive oxidants and carcinogenic volatile nitrosocompounds of cigarette smoke. A new method for protection against the dangerous cigarette constituents. Anticancer Res 1994; 14: 2717-2726] it was claimed that the new 'bio-filter' (activated carbon impregnated with dry hemoglobin) reduces certain toxic substances and oxidants (like NO, CO, NOx, H2O2, aldehydes, trace elements and nitroso-compounds) in the gas-phase of the mainstream smoke. We have investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) the mainstream and sidestream smoke of the BF cigarette, in comparison with three other cigarettes with similar tar and nicotine contents, that have conventional acetate filters. We found that BF cigarette smoke has similar tar radical species with the same intensity EPR signals to those of the other cigarettes. The ability of the aqueous cigarette tar extracts to produce hydroxyl radicals (HO*), which were spin trapped by DMPO, was very similar to, or even higher than, the other 3 brands. The gas-phase of the mainstream smoke of the BF cigarette showed a 30-35% reduction in the production of oxygen-centered radicals (spin trapped with PBN). In the case of the sidestream smoke, BF cigarettes produced substantially higher concentrations of gas-phase radicals, compared to the other brands. These results suggest that BF is partially effective at removing some of the gas-phase oxidants but not effective in the reduction of tar and its radical species in the mainstream and sidestream smoke. It is well known from epidemiological studies that tar content is strongly associated with increasing risk to smokers of lung cancer. In our experiments, BF cigarettes produce a higher amount of tar and stable free radical species than the other 3 brands in the sidestream smoke (between puffs), thus potentially increasing risk to the smoker and passive smoker.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Varenicline and combination of two NRTs is equally effective, while varenicline alone is more effective than either NRT or bupropion SR. NRT is extremely safe but cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse events with varenicline have been reported. These treatments have also been shown to be effective in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A model study is the Lung Health Study from the USA. Findings from this study of 5,587 patients with mild COPD showed that repeated smoking cessation for a period of 5 yrs resulted in a quit rate of 37%. After 14.5 yrs the quitters had a higher lung function and a higher survival rate. A study with a new nicotine formulation, a mouth spray, showed high relative efficacy. As 5-10% of quitters use long-term NRT, we report the results of a study where varenicline compared with placebo increased the quit rate in long-term users of NRT. Smoking cessation is the most effective intervention in stopping the progression of COPD, as well as increasing survival and reducing morbidity. This is why smoking cessation should be the top priority in the treatment of COPD.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

This statement covers electronic cigarettes (ECIGs), defined as ""electrical devices that generate an aerosol from a liquid"" and thus excludes devices that contain tobacco. Database searches identified published articles that were used to summarise the current knowledge on the epidemiology of ECIG use; their ingredients and accompanied health effects; second-hand exposure; use of ECIGs for smoking cessation; behavioural aspects of ECIGs and social impact; in vitro and animal studies; and user perspectives.ECIG aerosol contains potentially toxic chemicals. As compared to conventional cigarettes, these are fewer and generally in lower concentrations. Second-hand exposures to ECIG chemicals may represent a potential risk, especially to vulnerable populations. There is not enough scientific evidence to support ECIGs as an aid to smoking cessation due to a lack of controlled trials, including those that compare ECIGs with licenced stop-smoking treatments. So far, there are conflicting data that use of ECIGs results in a renormalisation of smoking behaviour or for the gateway hypothesis. Experiments in cell cultures and animal studies show that ECIGs can have multiple negative effects. The long-term effects of ECIG use are unknown, and there is therefore no evidence that ECIGs are safer than tobacco in the long term. Based on current knowledge, negative health effects cannot be ruled out.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

There is growing evidence of the potential harms of vaping. E-liquids used for e-cigarettes contain a wide range of harmful substances, and the clinical consequences of this are now being increasingly demonstrated, such as the rise in cases of e-cigarette- or vaping-associated lung injury. In addition, early use may result in long-term nicotine addiction. Vaping companies utilise marketing methods that distinctly target young people, and weak legislation in the UK allows them free rein to expose children to vaping. In this review we demonstrate why children must be protected from vaping. We must have stringent legislation to prevent easy access to e-cigarettes, including banning the convenience and affordability disposable vapes provide, and prevent marketing that does not warn about the potential health effects. The Australia approach of prescription or pharmacy only access for smoking cessation should be considered to limit exposure of children and minimise use by nonsmokers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This review aims to investigate whether DU can promote smoking cessation. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, and all longitudinal studies reporting transitions between DU, exclusive EC use and exclusive CC use were included. Two independent reviewers screened and read all records. Use status transitions among DU were compared to transitions among exclusive e-cigarette users and exclusive CC smokers. RESULTS: 46 records (16 original studies) were identified. Of 16 included studies, eight could be pooled for meta-analysis. The studies showed great heterogeneity, and many presented moderate to high risks of bias. Most DU who changed state transitioned to cigarette smoking. Baseline DU were less likely to report a transition into complete abstinence compared to exclusive CC smokers and exclusive EC users. About one-fifth of DU remained in the same use status after >16-24 months, exposing them to DU for a prolonged time. After >24-48 months, 8% of DU maintained DU. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that DU is not a first step towards smoking cessation, with most DU continuing cigarette consumption either through persistent DU or exclusive CC smoking. Relatively fewer DU transitioned into complete nicotine abstinence compared to exclusive CC and exclusive EC users. The concerns raised about limitations of current evidence highlight the need for more research focused on use status transitions among DU.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

We aimed to explore if smokeless tobacco such as snus used in pregnancy increased the risk of lower lung function in infancy and if the associations differed by sex. METHODS: From the Scandinavian population-based Preventing Atopic Dermatitis and ALLergies in Children birth cohort, we included 1163 infants with available tidal flow-volume measurements at 3 months of age and maternal self-reported use of nicotine-containing products in pregnancy. The risk of a ratio of time to peak tidal expiratory flow to total expiratory time <25th percentile by any nicotine exposure, snus exclusively and cigarette smoking with or without other nicotine-containing products was explored by regression analyses adjusting for maternal age, education and asthma. RESULTS: Overall 120 out of 1163 (10.3%) infants were exposed to any nicotine in utero, 71 out of 120 by snus exclusively and 49 out of 120 by smoking, with six also exposed to snus. By pregnancy week 6, 85.8% of mothers reported stopping nicotine use. The risk of lower lung function was higher in children exposed in utero to nicotine-containing products with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.59) with a similar tendency for snus exclusively (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.88-2.71) and smoking (OR 1.79, 0.84-3.84). Effect estimates were similar after adjusting for covariates. No differences of the effect by sex were observed. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that in utero exposure to not only cigarettes, but also snus, may negatively affect infant lung function.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Supply-side focused measures, though less familiar, deserve consideration, particularly to achieve 'endgame' tobacco control aims (e.g. achieving close to zero smoking prevalence). We explored attitudes towards supply-side focused 'endgame' tobacco control approaches and how they can be best communicated with senior policymakers, journalists, and public health practitioners. METHODS: We identified five supply-side focused approaches which could potentially lead to the tobacco endgame: two structural models and three discrete actions. The structural models were: (i) a Nicotine Authority to coordinate tobacco control activities and regulate the nicotine/tobacco market for public health aims; and (ii) a Tobacco Supply Agency acting as a monopoly purchaser of tobacco products and controlling the tobacco supply for public health aims. The actions were: (a) allocating progressively reducing tobacco product import quotas (the 'sinking lid') until importation and commercial sale of tobacco products ceased; (b) making tobacco companies responsible for reducing smoking prevalence with stringent financial penalties if targets were missed; and (c) new laws to facilitate litigation against tobacco companies. These approaches were presented as means to achieve a tobacco free New Zealand by 2020 to 19 senior policymakers, journalists, and public health physicians in two focus groups and eight interviews, and their reactions sought. RESULTS: The tobacco-free vision was widely supported. Participants engaged fully with the proposed tobacco control approaches, which were viewed as interesting or even intriguing. Most supported increasing the focus on supply-side measures. Views differed greatly about the desirability, feasibility and likely effectiveness of each approach. Participants identified a range of potential barriers to implementation and challenges to successfully advocating and communicating these approaches. The current framing of tobacco as a risky but legal commodity was noted as an important potential barrier to implementing endgame approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Endgame tobacco control approaches were considered to be viable policy options. Further policy analysis, research and public discussion are needed to develop endgame approaches. A significant change in the public framing of tobacco may be a prerequisite for implementing endgame solutions.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Participants answered a battery of questions on their attitudes and beliefs about aspects of the FSPTCA. RESULTS: Most smokers were unaware of the new FDA tobacco regulations. Smokers indicated support for banning cigarette promotion and nearly a quarter supported requiring tobacco companies to sell cigarettes in plain packaging.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 8681 adults aged ≥18 years in rural areas of Yunnan Province, China from 2010 to 2011. A standardized questionnaire was administered to obtain data about participants' demographic characteristics, individual socioeconomic status, ethnicity, self-reported smoking habits, and exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS). The socioeconomic predictors of current smoking, nicotine addiction, and SHS exposure were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of tobacco use were much higher in men compared with women (current smoking 68.5% vs. 1.3%; and nicotine dependence 85.2% vs. 72.7%). However, the rate of SHS exposure was higher in women compared with men (76.6% vs. 70.5%). Tobacco farmers had higher prevalence rates of current smoking, nicotine dependence, and SHS exposure compared with participants not engaged in tobacco farming (P<0.01). Most tobacco users (84.5%) reported initiating smoking during adolescence. A total of 81.1% of smokers smoked in public places, and 77.6% smoked in workplaces. Individuals belonging to an ethnic minority had a lower probability of SHS exposure and nicotine dependence. Individual educational level was found to be inversely associated with the prevalence of current smoking, exposure to SHS, and nicotine dependence. Higher annual household income was associated with a greater risk of nicotine dependence.

RESULTS: Of the 1380 randomized subjects (coverage, 696; no coverage, 684), 682 (98.0%) and 435 (63.6%), respectively, were dispensed at least one smoking cessation medication dose. The 7-day PPA at week 26 was higher in the full coverage versus no coverage group: 20.8% (n = 145) and 13.9% (n = 95), respectively; odds ratio (OR) = 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-2.18; p = 0.001. Urine cotinine-confirmed 7-day PPA at week 26 was 15.7% (n = 109) and 10.1% (n = 69), respectively; OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.21-2.33; p = 0.002. After pharmacotherapy, coverage eligibility was withdrawn from the full coverage group, continuous abstinence between weeks 26 and 52 was 6.6% (n = 46) and 5.6% (n = 38), in the full coverage and no coverage groups, respectively; OR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.76-1.87; p = 0.439. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the adoption of a smoking cessation medication coverage drug policy was an effective intervention to improve 26-week quit rates in Canada. The advantages were lost once coverage was discontinued. Further study is required on the duration of coverage to prevent relapse to smoking.

However, smokeless tobacco products are not required to carry graphic warning labels, and as of September 2014, electronic cigarettes in the US carry no warning labels and are aggressively marketed, including with ""reduced harm"" or ""FDA Approved"" messages. METHODS: In this online experiment, 483 US adult non-users of tobacco were randomized to view print advertisements for moist snuff, snus, and e-cigarettes with either warning labels (current warning label, graphic warning label) or ""endorsements"" (a ""lower risk"" label proposed by a tobacco company, an ""FDA Approved"" label) or control (tobacco advertisement with no label, advertisement for a non-tobacco consumer products). Main outcome measures included changes in perceived harm, positive attitudes towards, openness to using, and interest in a free sample of moist snuff, snus, and e-cigarettes. RESULTS: The graphic warning label increased perceived harm of moist snuff and e-cigarettes. ""Lower risk"" and ""FDA Approved"" labels decreased perceived harm of moist snuff and snus respectively. Current warning label and graphic warning label significantly lowered positive attitudes towards e-cigarettes. In this sample of non-users of tobacco, 15% were interested in a free sample of alternative tobacco products (predominantly e-cigarettes). Proportion of participants interested in a free sample did not differ significantly across the conditions, but those interested in a free sample had significantly lower perceptions of harm of corresponding tobacco products. CONCLUSIONS: Regulatory agencies should not allow ""lower risk"" warning labels, which have similar effects to the ""FDA Approved"" label, which is prohibited, and should consider implementing graphic warning labels for smokeless tobacco products and e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The 2004 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (US Senate bill S2461) would have given the US Food and Drug Administration limited authority to regulate cigarettes to ""protect the public health."" However, such legislation is unlikely to substantially reduce smoking or related deaths. DISCUSSION: The past 500 years of tobacco control efforts demonstrate that nicotine prohibition is a practical impossibility for numerous reasons, state revenue being one of the most ominous. The FDA already has regulatory authority over pharmaceutical grade nicotine products, and requires pharmacists to dispense the most addictive of these only with prescriptions. Meanwhile, every corner store can sell far more addictive and dangerous cigarettes to any adult. The FDA could immediately increase competition between cigarettes and clean nicotine products by approving available nicotine products for over-the-counter sales to adults. Similarly permissive regulation of cigarettes and addictive nicotine products will reduce tobacco use and improve smokers' health, but increase nicotine use in the population. Fortunately, restricted youth access and accurate labeling of nicotine's absolute risks will dissuade many non-smokers from experimenting with it, while accurate depiction of its risks relative to cigarette smoking will encourage many smokers to switch. The FDA could take a series of small steps that might ultimately replace a large proportion of cigarette smoking with equally addictive nicotine products, without risking serious public health setbacks. Vaccine, methadone, and injury prevention policies establish relevant public health precedents. SUMMARY: Cigarettes, or an equally addictive alternative, will be a permanent and common product in most societies. Regulations restricting only the safest addictive nicotine products are hard to justify. Addictive nicotine compliments other tobacco control strategies. Modern tobacco control policies are applicable to addictive nicotine. Controlled trials and test market studies are urgently needed to evaluate addictive nicotine as an alternative to smoking. Meanwhile, legislators should preserve the Food and Drug Administration's option to permit non-prescription sales of addictive nicotine.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Instead of focusing on the activity itself, HR focuses on the risks related to the activity. Currently, tobacco HR is controversial, generally not discussed, and consequently, poorly evaluated. In this paper, we try to pinpoint some of the main reasons for this lack of interest or reluctance to carry out or fund this type of research. In this paper we deal with the following issues: the status of nicotine in society, the reluctance of the mainstream anti-tobacco lobby toward the HR approach, the absence of smokers from the debate, the lack of information disseminated to the general population and politicians, the need to protect young people, the role of physicians, the future of HR research, and the role of tobacco companies.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

More men use snus than smoke cigarettes in Sweden, and a quarter of male former smokers quit by switching to snus. Leading multinational cigarette manufacturers have begun test-marketing snus-like products in the United States and other countries. The version of Philip Morris' Marlboro snus currently being marketed in the United States differs from Swedish snus in many ways; it has lower moisture content and pH, but most puzzling is its very low nicotine delivery. Philip Morris, the market-leader in United States cigarette sales, may have designed the product so that it does not satisfy nicotine cravings and fails to enable smokers to switch. In this paper we compare and contrast Swedish snus and Marlboro snus, and speculate as to why Philip Morris may have intentionally designed a product that delivers very low levels of nicotine. We recommend that Philip Morris cease using the term ""snus"" to refer to dry tobacco products with low nicotine delivery, so that the term be reserved for moist, low-toxin, medium/high nicotine delivery smokeless tobacco products that are qualitatively similar to the leading brands in Sweden.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Reynolds' novel dissolvable tobacco in a US test market.,"BACKGROUND: With declining cigarette sales, tobacco manufacturers have been developing and marketing new smokeless products, such as R. J. Reynolds' dissolvable tobacco, Camel Sticks, Strips and Orbs. This study assessed the availability, price and point-of-purchase promotional strategies for Camel Dissolvables, and investigated consumer awareness, interest and perception of these products in the Indiana test market. METHODS: An exploratory retail audit of point-of-purchase promotions was conducted in a random sample of retailers from 6 store categories (n = 81) in the test market area. Data included: store type, location, product placement, forms/flavors carried, price, types and locations of advertisements and promotions, and ad messages. An Awareness-Attitude-Usage (AAU) survey was used to gauge consumer awareness and knowledge of tobacco products including Camel Dissolvables. Respondents were shown promotional materials from a package onsert and perceptions and interest in the Camel Dissolvables were assessed. An Intended Target Survey (ITS) compared subjects' perceptions of ad targets for several non-tobacco products, as well as Camel Snus, Camel No. 9 and Camel Dissolvables. Respondents were asked to identify each ad's intended target category, perceived targetedness, and purchase intent. RESULTS: The products were carried by 46% of stores, most frequently gas stations (100%) and convenience stores (75%). They were shelved near smokeless tobacco (70%), cigarettes (25%) or candy (5%). Prices ranged from $3.59 -$4.19 per package; most stores carried at least 1 promotional item. Ad messages included: ""Dissolvable Tobacco"" (60%). ""Free Trial"" (24%), ""Special Price"" (24%), ""What's Your Style?"" (22%). At 14% of stores, free trial packs of Camel Dissolvables were offered with another Camel purchase. Awareness was reported by 42% of respondents (n = 243), and trial by 3%. Consumer interest was very low, but younger respondents (< 40 years) were more familiar with Camel Dissolvables (60% vs. 45% for those > 40 years, p < .01). Males, as well as current and former smokers had higher rates of interest and trial; only 1% of never smokers reported trial. In the ITS, only for the 3 tobacco product ads, was perceived targetedness for smokers significantly higher than for non-smokers. Smokers and nonsmokers perceived that the ads targeted smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Current retail promotional strategies for Camel Sticks, Strips & Orbs appear to be targeting a select audience, primarily current smokers.

Standard smoking cessation protocols suggest commencing nicotine replacement therapy only on the first day of quitting smoking (quit day) aiming to reduce withdrawal symptoms and craving. However, other, more successful smoking cessation pharmacotherapies are used prior to the quit day as well as after. Nicotine preloading could improve quit rates by reducing satisfaction from smoking prior to quitting and breaking the association between smoking and reward. A systematic literature review suggests that evidence for the effectiveness of preloading is inconclusive and further trials are needed. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a study protocol for a multicenter, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial based in the United Kingdom, enrolling 1786 smokers who want to quit, funded by the National Institute for Health Research, Health Technology Assessment program, and sponsored by the University of Oxford. Participants will primarily be recruited through general practices and smoking cessation clinics, and randomized (1:1) either to use 21 mg nicotine patches, or not, for four weeks before quitting, whilst smoking as normal. All participants will be referred to receive standard smoking cessation service support. Follow-ups will take place at one week, four weeks, six months and 12 months after quit day. The primary outcome will be prolonged, biochemically verified six-month abstinence. Additional outcomes will include point prevalence abstinence and abstinence of four-week and 12-month duration, side effects, costs of treatment, and markers of potential mediators and moderators of the preloading effect. DISCUSSION: This large trial will add substantially to evidence on the effectiveness of nicotine preloading, but also on its cost effectiveness and potential mediators, which have not been investigated in detail previously. A range of recruitment strategies have been considered to try and compensate for any challenges encountered in recruiting the large sample, and the multicentre design means that knowledge can be shared between recruitment teams. The pragmatic study design means that results will give a realistic estimate of the success of the intervention if it were to be rolled out as part of standard smoking cessation service practice.

User usually places a pouch between the upper jaw and cheek to obtain euphoria from tobacco, leading to partial intake of tobacco constituents. To evaluate user exposure to tobacco, an approach with a novel model mouth system was developed and applied to evaluate release of nicotine from the pouch. RESULTS: A novel model mouth system has been developed to evaluate release behavior of tobacco constituents in pouch moist snuff. The system consists of the release medium reservoir module, the flow speed control module, the temperature control module, nicotine release module, and release solution collection module, and simulates buccal condition in terms of temperature, saliva compositions, and the rate of saliva production, etc. Artificial saliva was used as the release medium to evaluate release of nicotine in pouch moist snuff. The optimized test condition was that the release temperature of 37°C and the flow rate performed at 0.2 mL min-1 in the first 5 min and 0.1 mL min-1 in the next 55 min. The performance of the model mouth system was compared with in vivo data of nicotine release in human volunteers. Data from 23 brands of moist snuff indicated that nicotine release rates increased with extraction time and approximately 60-90% of nicotine was released after 30 min of extraction in most of the samples, and the release behavior of nicotine was affected by product weights, nicotine concentration, and product pH, etc. CONCLUSION: The model mouth system can be used to evaluate the release behavior of constituents in pouch moist snuff, especially those directly related to human health such as nicotine and tobacco specific nitrosamine (TSNA), etc. This indicated that the system is an alternative tool to evaluate user exposure to tobacco. With further testing and validation, the model mouth system can be applied in risk evaluation of smokeless tobacco products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

It has shown efficacy over placebo and bupropion in manufacturer-sponsored trials. Those with mental illness were excluded from these trials. There are case reports of exacerbation of mental illness and development of psychiatric symptoms with varenicline use. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old male Caucasian being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder, depression not otherwise specified and alcohol dependence, was prescribed varenicline while he was in a post-traumatic stress disorder/alcohol dual diagnosis treatment program. He developed visual hallucinations, which became worse with titration of the medication. These symptoms resolved upon discontinuation of varenicline. CONCLUSION: Patients with mental illness have a higher incidence of nicotine dependence, and attempts should be made for smoking cessation. Varenicline has not been widely tested in this population. There are reports of exacerbation of mental illness, and probable causation of psychiatric symptoms in the mentally ill. Providers should be aware of this possibility and advise their patients appropriately.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Ammonia has been included in the non-exhaustive priority list of 39 tobacco components and emissions of cigarette published by the World Health Organization (WHO) Study Group on Tobacco Product Regulation. The development of a simple ammonia detection method will contribute to the establishment of tobacco product regulation under tobacco control policies and allow surveys to be conducted, even by laboratories with small research budgets. METHODS: We developed a simple colorimetric method based on the salicylate-chlorine reaction and absorption spectrometry with two reagents (sodium nitroprusside and sodium dichloroisocyanurate). To compare this method to conventional ion chromatography, we analyzed the ammonia levels in tobacco fillers extracted from 35 Japanese commercially marketed cigarette brands manufactured by four tobacco companies (Japan Tobacco (JT) Inc., British American Tobacco (BAT), Philip Morris Japan, and Natural American Spirit). We also analyzed the ammonia levels in the sidestream smoke from cigarettes of the brands that were found to contain high or low tobacco filler ammonia levels. RESULTS: The ammonia levels in the reference cigarette (3R4F) measured by our method and ion chromatography were similar and comparable to previously reported levels. The ammonia levels in tobacco fillers extracted from 35 cigarette brands ranged from 0.25 to 1.58 mg/g. The mean ammonia level of JT cigarette brands was significantly higher (0.83 ± 0.28 mg/g) than that of Natural American Spirit cigarette brands (0.30 ± 0.08 mg/g) and lower than those in the other two cigarette brands (1.11 ± 0.19 mg/g for BAT and 1.24 ± 0.15 mg/g for Philip Morris) (p < 0.001 by Bonferroni test). The ammonia levels in the sidestream smoke of CABIN, Marlboro Black Menthol, American Spirit Light, and Seven Stars were 5.89 ± 0.28, 5.23 ± 0.12, 6.92 ± 0.56, and 4.14 ± 0.19 mg/cigarette, respectively. The ammonia levels were higher in sidestream smoke than in tobacco filler. CONCLUSIONS: Our simple colorimetric could be used to analyze ammonia in tobacco fillers and sidestream smoke. There were significant differences between the ammonia levels of the 35 commercially marketed cigarette brands in Japan manufactured by four tobacco manufacturers. Over 90% of the ammonia in sidestream smoke was in gaseous phase.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

RESULT: Phenotypically, the F1 hybrids (Vall6 × Basma) show prominent heterosis in nicotine content by 3 years of field experiments. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes participating in nicotine anabolism (ADC, PMT, MPO, QPT, AO, QS, QPT, A622, BBLs) and nicotine transport (JAT2, MATE1 and 2, NUP1 and 2) showed an upregulated expression in the hybrid, a majority of which demonstrated an overdominant performance. RT-PCR confirmed that nicotine anabolism was induced in the hybrid.

Topping, a common agricultural practice employed with flue-cured tobacco, is designed to increase leaf nicotine contents by increasing nicotine biosynthesis in roots. Many genes are found to be differentially expressed in response to topping, particularly genes involved in nicotine biosynthesis, but comprehensive analyses of early transcriptional responses induced by topping are not yet available. To develop a detailed understanding of the mechanisms regulating nicotine biosynthesis after topping, we have sequenced the transcriptomes of Nicotiana tabacum roots at seven time points following topping. RESULTS: Differential expression analysis revealed that 4830 genes responded to topping across all time points. Amongst these, nine gene families involved in nicotine biosynthesis and two gene families involved in nicotine transport showed significant changes during the immediate 24 h period following topping. No obvious preference to the parental species was detected in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Significant changes in transcript levels of nine genes involved in nicotine biosynthesis and phytohormone signal transduction were validated by qRT-PCR assays. 549 genes encoding transcription factors (TFs), found to exhibit significant changes in gene expression after topping, formed 15 clusters based on similarities of their transcript level time-course profiles. 336 DEGs involved in phytohormone signal transduction, including genes functionally related to the phytohormones jasmonic acid, abscisic acid, auxin, ethylene, and gibberellin, were identified at the earliest time point after topping. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provides the first detailed analysis of the early transcriptional responses to topping in N. tabacum, and identifies excellent candidates for further detailed studies concerning the regulation of nicotine biosynthesis in tobacco roots.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

(tobacco) varieties with varying nicotine content. However, the reasons for the formation of nicotine heterosis and its relationship to nicotine transport and accumulation remain unknown. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of six tobacco hybrids with varying heterosis levels and their parent materials from various aspects, such as phenotype, physiology, and transcriptomics. The results showed that the direct path coefficient of transport heterosis to nicotine heterosis was highest in hybrids, at 0.98, and a highly significant positive correlation between the two. The plant height, thick stalk circumference, large flow of tissue fluid in the stalk, and high nicotine concentration of tobacco were the underlying factors that led to the strong nicotine transport capacity of hybrids. The formation of nicotine transport heterosis in hybrids was mainly influenced by non-additive gene effects (accounting for 89.93%), with over-dominant effects playing a dominant role (accounting for 58.79%). Among non-additive expression DEGs, nicotine transporter related multi antimicrobial extrusion protein, drug/metabolite transporter, ABC family transporter, and glutathione S-transferase were significantly upregulated in hybrid strains. The RT-qPCR results indicated that these genes related nicotine transport also exhibited heterosis at the expression level. Our results revealed that the formation of nicotine heterosis is mainly achieved by enhancing the nicotine transport capacity in hybrids. The results are not only beneficial for promoting the theoretical study of nicotine heterosis in tobacco and the breeding and utilization of hybrids, but are also of great significance for guiding nicotine production and promoting its multipurpose utilization.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether EBR enhances leaf nicotine content under low temperature conditions during the mature stage of flue-cured tobacco. RESULTS: To investigate the effects of EBR on leaf nicotine content under low temperature conditions during the mature stage of 'Yunyan 87' flue-cured tobacco, four treatments (foliar spraying of 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg·L- 1 EBR solutions) were performed by using a single-factor randomized complete block design. The result showed that foliar spraying of different concentrations of EBR notably improve the agronomic and economic traits of flue-cured tobacco to varying degrees, as well as increase the total nitrogen and nicotine content in the tobacco leaves. 0.2 mg·L- 1 EBR treatment showed better results, with nicotine content in the middle and upper leaves after curing increasing by 11.11% and 19.90%, respectively, compared to CK. Compared to the single EBR, foliar spraying of EBR compound containing α-Cyclodextrin and Tween 80 prolongs the effect of EBR, promotes the growth and development of tobacco plants. Combining EBR with CaCl2 and ZnSO4·7H2O significantly enhances the cold resistance of tobacco plants. Furthermore, combining EBR with higher concentrations of KH2PO4 is more effective in promoting the maturation and yellowing of the upper leaves than those with lower concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights that foliar application of EBR enhances leaf nicotine content under low temperature conditions during the mature stage of flue-cured tobacco by regulating cold stress tolerance. The integration of EBR with α-Cyclodextrin, Tween 80, CaCl2, ZnSO4·7H2O and KH2PO4 showcases a novel approach to extending the effectiveness of plant growth regulators and improving agricultural sustainability. Furthermore, these findings may be applicable to other cold-sensitive crops, offering broader benefits for improving resilience and productivity under low temperatures. However, the research focuses on two growth cycles, without investigating the long-term impact of EBR on soil health, crop sustainability, and ecosystem. And further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of EBR on enhancing leaf nicotine content.

The present study was designed to reveal tobacco leaves' dynamic phytochemical and metabolite profile changes under three different storage conditions: natural (NT), mechanical (MC), and air-conditioning (AC). The 210,003 grade (Hubei Central Tobacco) was selected as the experimental material, and the changes in iodine value absorbance (IV), pH, polyphenols, plastid pigments, conventional chemical compositions, and metabolite profile were analyzed at different times (T0, starting day; T1, three months; T2, five months; and T3, nine months) during storage. RESULTS: The IV significantly increased with the storage duration, while the pH, polyphenols, and stromal pigments had the opposite trends. Lutein, β-carotene, and chlorogenic acid were significantly less degraded under MC and AC than NT. Neoxanthin and chlorophyll b were completely degraded at T3. The nicotine, total sugar, reducing sugar, and chlorine content significantly varied along with the storage duration, reaching their maximum values at T2 under MC and AC. The sugar/base ratio at T3 under MC and AC was 8.53 and 8.44, respectively, higher than in NT (5.85). LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics analysis identified 124‒224, 138‒180, and 110‒153 significant differential accumulated metabolites (DAMs) under NT, MC, and AC, respectively. Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites was significantly induced under the three storage conditions between T0 and T3. Glutathione metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation were induced under NT.

We used the Epic Cosmos electronic health record research platform to harness nationwide data from health care systems across the United States using the Epic electronic health record to analyze the prevalence, demographics, comorbid conditions and treatments for the TACs. METHODS: We queried the Epic Cosmos electronic health record database for patients with diagnoses of hemicrania continua, cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, and SUNCT. Prevalences, demographics were determined from this database and comorbid conditions and treatments for these conditions were analyzed. RESULTS: Our study included 152,727 patients with cluster headache, 59,312 patients with paroxysmal hemicrania, 19,321 patients with hemicrania continua, and 6,291 patients with SUNCT. Five-year prevalence of cluster headache was highest (56.7 per 100,000), followed by paroxysmal hemicrania (22.0 per 100,000), hemicrania continua (7.2 per 100,000) and SUNCT (2.3 per 100,000). All four TACs showed a higher prevalence in women. Migraine was common in all four conditions and patients with cluster headache had the highest rates of nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis use disorders. Indomethacin was notably underutilized for the indomethacin-responsive TACs. CONCLUSION: We use a national electronic medical record database to give insight into elements of the TACs that have been previously limited by the relative rarity of these diseases.",['Nicotine/NRT'],Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Two heated tobacco sticks, called TEREA™ and SENTIA™, were launched in 2021 by Philip Morris International (New York, NY, USA), and their ingestion is associated with a risk of bowel injury because they contain a partially pointed metallic susceptor. However, this risk is not well known to the general public or healthcare providers. To increase awareness of this risk, we herein report a case involving extraction of a metallic susceptor after ingestion of the heated tobacco stick TEREA™. CASE PRESENTATION: A 7-month-old girl presented to the emergency department of a nearby hospital because she was suspected to have accidentally swallowed heated tobacco. Although she presented with no symptoms related to nicotine poisoning, abdominal X-ray examination revealed a metal object in her stomach. According to a statement released by the Japan Poison Information Center, the TEREA™ heated tobacco stick contains a metallic susceptor with a rectangular shape and sharp corners. The patient was transferred to our department because of the risk of bowel injury, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed. No cigarettes were found by endoscopic observation; however, a metallic susceptor was located in the second part of the duodenum. We grasped it with biopsy forceps and carefully removed it using an endoscope with a cap attached to the tip. The post-endoscopic course was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients who ingest heated tobacco sticks might be exposed not only to the effects of nicotine but also to physical damage caused by a metallic susceptor. Infants and toddlers especially could swallow these sticks, therefore tobacco companies need to make the problem more public. Clinicians also should alert the problem, and pay attention to this risk in the clinical setting.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This trial sought to assess the feasibility and acceptability of supplying an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) starter kit for smoking cessation as an adjunct to usual care for smoking cessation, to smokers with a mental health condition treated in the community, to inform a future effectiveness trial. METHODS: This randomised controlled feasibility trial, conducted March-December 2022, compared the intervention (e-cigarette starter kit with a corresponding information leaflet and demonstration with Very Brief Advice) with a 'usual care' control at 1-month follow-up. Participants were ≥ 18 years, receiving treatment for any mental health condition in primary or secondary care in three Mental Health Trusts in Yorkshire and one in London, UK. They were also willing to address their smoking through either cessation or reduction of cigarette consumption. The agreed primary outcome measure was feasibility (consent ~ 15% of eligible participants; attrition rate < 30%). Acceptability, validated sustained abstinence and ≥ 50% cigarette consumption reduction at 1-month, were also evaluated and qualitative interviews conducted to further explore acceptability in this population. RESULTS: Feasibility targets were partially met; of 201 eligible participants, 43 (mean age = 45.2, SD = 12.7; 39.5% female) were recruited (21.4%) and randomised (intervention:48.8%, n = 21; control:51.2%, n = 22). Attrition rate was 37.2% at 1-month follow-up and was higher (45.5%) in the control group. At follow-up (n = 27), 93.3% (n = 14) in the intervention group and 25.0% (n = 3) in the control group reported e-cigarette use. The intervention was well received with minimal negative effects. In intention-to-treat analysis, validated sustained abstinence at 1-month was 2/21 (9.5%) and 0/22 (0%) and at least 50% reduction in cigarette consumption 13/21 (61.9%) and 3/22 (13.6%), for the intervention and control group, respectively. Qualitative analysis of participant interviews (N = 5) showed the intervention was broadly acceptable, but they also highlighted areas of improvements for the intervention and trial delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Offering an e-cigarette starter kit to smokers with a mental health condition treated in the community was acceptable and largely feasible, with harm reduction outcomes (i.e. switching from cigarette smoking to e-cigarette use and substantial reduction in cigarette consumption) favouring the intervention. The findings of the study will be used to help inform the design of a main trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registry: ISRCTN. REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN17691451.

The study was designed and sponsored by a tobacco company and implemented by contract research organizations in 2002-2003. Multiple analyses of smoking behavior, demographics, and biomarkers were performed. Study data and banked biospecimens were transferred from the sponsor to the Virginia Tobacco and Health Research Repository in 2010, and then to SRI International in 2012, for independent analysis and dissemination. METHODS: We analyzed biomarker distributions overall, and by biospecimen availability, for comparison with existing studies, and to evaluate generalizability to the entire sample. We calculated genome-wide statistical power for a priori hypotheses. We performed clinical chemistries, nucleic acid extractions and genotyping, and report correlation and quality control metrics. RESULTS: Vital signs, clinical chemistries, and laboratory measures of tobacco specific and non-specific toxicants are available from 3585 current cigarette smokers, and 1077 non-users. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, red blood cells, plasma and 24-h urine biospecimens are available from 3073 participants (2355 smokers and 719 non-users). In multivariate analysis, participants with banked biospecimens were significantly more likely to self-identify as White, to be older, to have increased total nicotine equivalents per cigarette, decreased serum cotinine, and increased forced vital capacity, compared to participants without. Effect sizes were small (Cohen's d-values ≤ 0.11). Power for a priori hypotheses was 57 % in non-Hispanic Black (N = 340), and 96 % in non-Hispanic White (N = 1840), smokers. All DNA samples had genotype completion rates ≥97.5 %; 68 % of RNA samples yielded RIN scores ≥6.0. CONCLUSIONS: Total Exposure Study clinical and laboratory assessments and biospecimens comprise a unique resource for cigarette smoke health effects research. The Total Exposure Study Analysis Consortium seeks to perform molecular studies in multiple domains and will share data and analytic results in public repositories and the peer-reviewed literature. Data and banked biospecimens are available for independent or collaborative research.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Five e-cigarettes with different e-liquid formulations containing 1.6 % and 2.4 % nicotine and a conventional tobacco cigarette were randomized among 24 subjects under two exposure sessions consisting of a 30-min controlled and a one-hour ad lib use period to assess plasma nicotine levels, impacts on smoking urge and adverse events. The 30-min controlled use session comprised an intensive use of the e-cigarettes with a total of 50 puffs taken every 30 s for comparison to a single conventional cigarette having a typical machine-measured nicotine yield (~0.8 mg). Ad lib product use conditions provided insight into more naturalistic product use behaviors and their accompanying smoking urge reductions. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by the Principal Investigator. RESULTS: Significant (p < 0.05) increases in plasma nicotine concentrations occurred within 10 min of controlled e-cigarette use and significant (p < 0.001) reductions from baseline smoking urge were observed within 5 min. E-cigarette and cigarette nicotine plasma levels were comparable for up to one hour of use. After both sessions (90 min), nicotine exposure was the highest for the cigarette, with all e-cigarettes showing 23 % to 53 % lower plasma concentrations. During controlled use, peak reduction in smoking urge for e-cigs occurred later than for the cigarette. After completion of both sessions, significant smoking urge reduction persisted for most of the tested e-cigarettes, albeit at levels lower than that provided by the tobacco cigarette. Nicotine content, vehicle differences, and the presence of menthol did not significantly affect smoking urge reduction by the e-cigarettes. No subjects were discontinued due to AEs. The most frequently reported AEs events included cough, throat irritation, headache, and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: Blood plasma nicotine levels obtained from short-term use of e-cigarettes containing 1.6 % and 2.4 % nicotine were significant, but lower than those of conventional tobacco cigarettes, yet the reduction in craving symptoms were broadly comparable. The types of AEs were consistent with other research studies of longer duration that have reported that use of e-cigarettes by adult smokers is well-tolerated.

When questions arose about health risks of tobacco, they focused on two key themes: 1) how bad is the problem (i.e., absolute risk) and 2) what can be done to reduce the risk without cessation (i.e., prospects for harm reduction). Using the United States since 1964 as an example, we outline the leading themes that have arisen in response to these two questions. Initially, there was the recognition that ""cigarettes are hazardous to health"" and an acceptance of safer alternative tobacco products (cigars, pipes, light/lower-tar cigarettes). In the 1980s there was the creation of the seminal theme that ""Cigarettes are lethal when used as intended and kill more people than heroin, cocaine, alcohol, AIDS, fires, homicide, suicide, and automobile crashes combined."" By around 2000, support for a less-dangerous light/lower tar cigarette was gone, and harm reduction claims were avoided for products like cigars and even for smokeless tobacco which were summarized as ""unsafe"" or ""not a safe alternative to cigarettes."" DISCUSSION: The Surgeon General in 2014 concluded that by far the greatest danger to public health was from cigarettes and other combusted products. At the same time the evidence base for smokeless tobacco and alternative nicotine delivery systems (ANDS) had grown. Product innovation and tobacco/nicotine bio-behavioral, epidemiological and public health sciences demonstrate that low nitrosamine smokeless tobacco (e.g., Swedish snus), and ANDS have substantially lower harms than cigarettes. Going forward, it is important to sharpen themes and key messages of tobacco control, while continuing to emphasize the extreme lethality of the inhaled smoke from cigarettes or from use of any combusting tobacco product. Implications of updating the leading themes for regulation, policymaking and advocacy in tobacco control are proposed as an important next step. A new reframing can align action plans to more powerfully and rapidly achieve population-level benefit and minimize harm to eliminate in our lifetime the use of the most deadly combustible tobacco products and thus prevent the premature deaths of 1 billion people projected to occur worldwide by 2100.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The Food and Drug Administration seeks novel ways to effectively communicate risks to warn about using these products. This paper describes the first step in developing a text messaging program delivered by smartphones that manipulate three messaging characteristics (i.e., depth, framing, and appeal). METHODS: Perceptions of community college students were described after previewing text messages designed to inform about risks of using conventional and new tobacco products. Thirty-one tobacco users and nonusers, aged 18-25 participated in five focus discussions held on two community college campuses. Attendees reviewed prototype messages and contributed feedback about text message structure and content. Qualitative data were coded and analyzed using NVivo Version 10. RESULTS: Most participants were female and two-thirds were ethnic minorities. A variety of conventional and new tobacco products in the past month were used by a third of participants. Three identified domains were derived from the qualitative data. These included perceived risks of using tobacco products, receptivity to message content, and logistical feedback regarding the future message campaign. CONCLUSION: Overall, participants found the messages to be interesting and appropriate. A gap in awareness of the risks of using new tobacco products was revealed. Feedback on the prototype messages was incorporated into message revisions. These findings provided preliminary confirmation that the forthcoming messaging program will be appealing to young adults.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Very little is known about the nature of interactions between WCTOH attendees and their linkages to tobacco control organizations, so knowing this information could help improve tobacco control efforts. METHODS: At the 2015 WCTOH, we implemented an online survey to assess barriers to global tobacco control activities, which information sources they use for tobacco control information, and with whom they interact regarding tobacco control. RESULTS: A total of 169 respondents completed the survey, with responses from all six World Health Organization (WHO) regions. Respondents worked in all areas of tobacco control; the most common were research (29.2%) and patient care/treatment (23.3%). The top barriers faced regarding tobacco control activities were: funding is weak (56.8%), government commitment (45.0%), tobacco industry interference (43.8%), and lack of coordination (34.3%). The network analysis identified Framework Convention Alliance (FCA) and Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) as the two most prominent groups that people belonged to and where they went to exchange information and best practices. Important regional and country specific groups also appear to be growing, such as the African Tobacco Control Alliance (ATCA) and the Argentinian Association of Tabacology (ASAT). DISCUSSION: Mapping and better understanding the global tobacco control network is important for informing knowledge exchange and best practices, particularly as increasing attention is being focused on global tobacco control efforts in low- and middle-income countries in particular. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that even a subsample of the WCTOH shows considerable collaboration. The full WCTOH network should be mapped in order to foster greater collaboration that has the the potential to improve global tobacco control efforts.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The development of modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs) has been suggested as a possible way to reduce the risks of tobacco smoking by reducing exposure to cigarette smoke toxicants. This study is designed to investigate whether biomarkers of such exposure are reduced when smokers switch from smoking commercial cigarettes to using either a novel or a commercially-available tobacco heating product (THP). DESIGN AND METHODS: This study will assess biomarkers of exposure in current smokers who either remain smoking, switch to THP use, or quit all tobacco use completely, for 5 days. The study is an in-clinic (confinement) two-centre, randomised controlled clinical study with a forced-switching design. Subjects of either gender will be aged 23-55 years (minimum legal smoking age plus 3 years), of Japanese origin and with a verified smoking status (assessed by exhaled breath carbon monoxide and urinary cotinine levels). Subjects will have a usual brand cigarette within the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) tar band of 6-8 mg and will be judged to be healthy by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiography (ECG), clinical biochemistry and lung function tests. The primary objective of this study is to assess changes within groups in selected biomarkers of exposure (BoE) and of biological effect (BoBE) after a forced switch from a commercial control cigarette to either a menthol or a non-menthol THP. Secondary objectives are to assess between-group differences, to determine nicotine pharmacokinetics for cigarettes and THPs, to assess subject's satisfaction with the study products, and to monitor additional endpoints related to safety and product use. DISCUSSION: Data from this study will advance our scientific understanding of the changes in exposure to cigarette smoke toxicants in smokers who switch to using a THP.

Yet in promoting their products, the tobacco industry frequently relies on affect, portraying their products as part of a desirable lifestyle. Research examining the roles of affect and perceived risks in smoking has been scant and non-existent for novel tobacco products, such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). METHODS: We examined the relationship between affect, perceived risk, and current use for cigarettes and e-cigarettes in 2015 in a nationally representative sample of 5398 U.S. adults who were aware of e-cigarettes. RESULTS: Participants held various affective associations with tobacco products, and affect towards cigarettes was more negative than affect towards e-cigarettes. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), affect towards cigarettes and e-cigarettes was associated with cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use respectively, and these associations were both direct and partially mediated by risk perceptions towards smoking and e-cigarette use. More positive affect towards cigarettes or e-cigarettes was associated with lower perceived risks, which in turn was associated with higher odds of being a current cigarette or e-cigarette user. CONCLUSIONS: In developing models explaining tobacco use behavior, or in creating public communication campaigns aimed at curbing tobacco use, it is useful to focus not only on the reason based predictors, such as perceptions of risks and benefits, but also on affective predictors. Educational efforts aimed at further smoking reductions should highlight and reinforce negative images and associations with cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, little is known about smokers' unprompted thoughts and feelings about additives. Such information could be used to shape future communication efforts. We explored the content and possible functions of spontaneous statements about cigarette additives made by smokers during a study examining reactions to learning about the genetic link to nicotine addiction. METHODS: Adult smokers (N = 84) were recruited from a medium-sized Midwestern city. Focus groups (N = 13) were conducted between April-September 2012. Data were analyzed by 2 coders using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Comments about cigarette additives arose without prompting by the focus group moderator. Three main themes were identified: (1) discussing additives helped participants navigate the conceptual link between smoking and genetics, (2) additives were discussed as an alternative mechanism for addiction to cigarettes, and (3) additives provided an alternative mechanism by which cigarette smoking exacerbates physical harm. Notably, discussion of additives contained a pervasive tone of mistrust illustrated by words like ""they"" and ""them,"" by statements of uncertainty such as ""you don't know what they're putting into cigarettes,"" and by negative affective verbalizations such as ""nasty"" and ""disgusting"". CONCLUSIONS: Participants had distinct beliefs about cigarette additives, each of which seemed to serve a purpose. Although mistrust may complicate communication about the health risks of tobacco use, health communication experts could use smokers' existing beliefs and feelings to better design more effective anti-smoking messages.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In this study we investigate how Chinese newspapers have covered E-cigarettes over the past ten years. METHODS: The study analyses the salience, patterns and content of news articles pertaining to E-cigarettes in regional and national Chinese outlets. A total of 476 articles are examined via content analysis and supervised automatic text analysis. The manual content analysis generates a coding scheme, which is then validated and applied to machine learning.

RESULTS: The study reveals that E-cigarettes have not received enough attention in terms of its salience in the media, though the amount of coverage has been growing. A large share of the articles is published around May of each year - which is when the No Tobacco Day of the WHO takes place. The results point to four major themes on E-cigarettes: nicotine/constituents/features, tobacco control/regulation, children's use of E-cigarettes, and tobacco market/industry.

However, data on support for potential e-cigarette regulations in Australia are limited. To inform regulatory efforts, the present study assessed attitudes to the regulation of e-cigarettes among Australian young adults, the most prevalent users of e-cigarettes and therefore the most likely population segment to be affected by e-cigarette regulations. METHODS: A total of 1116 Australians aged 18 to 25 years (59% female) completed an online survey where they were presented with various statements relating to the regulation of e-cigarettes and asked to report on the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with each. Statements presented either a restrictive or non-restrictive approach to e-cigarette regulation. RESULTS: Across all statements, 10-22% of respondents responded ""don't know"" while 23-35% neither agreed nor disagreed, indicating general ambivalence. There was a moderate level of support (33-37%) for regulating e-cigarette sales/use and treating e-cigarettes like tobacco products. Only 20% of respondents were in favour of allowing the use of e-cigarettes in smoke-free areas. Smokers, e-cigarette users, and those who did not believe in the harms associated with e-cigarettes were typically less likely than other respondents to support restrictive approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The young Australian adults surveyed were somewhat supportive of restrictions around the sale and use of e-cigarettes, but generally opposed outright bans and any need for a prescription from a medical practitioner. Increasing awareness of the harms associated with the use of e-cigarettes represents a potential strategy to gaining regulatory support.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The goals of this study were to explore who uses tobacco vaporizers, how these products are used, reasons for utilization, perceived advantages and risks. METHODS: Online questionnaire collected from October 2016 to January 2018 in self-selected visitors aged > 18 to an anti-addiction website. RESULTS: We obtained 170 valid responses, of whom 104 were using tobacco vaporizers. For homogeneity, we included only the 102 users of the Brand 1 tobacco vaporizer in our analysis, as there were only two users of other vaporizers. Among these 102 vaporizer users, about half were current cigarette smokers (57%), the rest were former cigarette smokers. The median age was 41, and the median duration of utilization was 9 months. Most (88%) used the vaporizer daily, 8% were occasional users and 4% were past users. Among current smokers, 80% were currently trying to reduce their cigarette consumption and 29% were trying to quit. The vaporizer was used mainly to replace cigarettes (94%), because it was perceived to be less toxic than cigarettes (89%), to help stop smoking or to avoid starting smoking again (72%), or to reduce cigarette consumption (71%). Current smokers who were daily or occasional vaporizer users reported smoking a median of 8.0 cigarettes per day, compared with 20.0 per day before they started to use the vaporizer (p < .0001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: In this online sample of early adopters, Brand 1 was by far the most frequently used tobacco vaporizer. It was used by current or former smokers only, mainly to replace cigarettes, and satisfaction ratings were good. Users considered the tobacco vaporizer to be less toxic than cigarette smoke and perceived it to be helpful for reducing or stopping smoking.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We wished to compare its estimates with those of alternative approaches, when applied to snus, used in Sweden for many years. METHODS: Modelling was restricted to men aged 30-79 years for 1980-2009 and to four smoking-related diseases. Mortality data were extracted for Sweden and other European countries. Published data provided Swedish prevalence estimates for combinations of never/former/current smoking and snus use, and smoking prevalence estimates for other European countries. Approach 1 compares mortality in Sweden and in other countries with a smoking prevalence similar to Sweden's prevalence of combined smoking/snus use. Approaches 2 and 3 compare mortality in Sweden with hypothetical mortality had snus users smoked. Approach 3 uses our health impact model, individuals starting with the tobacco prevalence of Sweden in 1980. Tobacco histories during 30-year follow-up were then estimated using transition probabilities, with risk derived using a negative exponential model. Approach 2 uses annual tobacco prevalence estimates coupled with estimates of relative risk of current and former smokers regardless of history. The main applications of Approaches 2 and 3 assume that only smoking affects mortality, though sensitivity analyses using Approach 3 allow for risk to vary in snus users and dual users. RESULTS: Using Approach 2, estimated mortality increases in Sweden in 1980-2009 had snus not been introduced were: lung cancer 8786; COPD 1781; IHD 10,409; stroke 1720. The main Approach 3 estimates were similar (7931, 1969; 12,501; 1901). They decreased as risk in snus users and dual users increased. Approach 1 estimates differed wildly (77,762, 32,538; 77,438; 76,946), remaining very different following correction for differences between Sweden and the comparison countries in non-smoking-related disease mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Approach 1 is unreliable, accounting inadequately for non-tobacco factors affecting mortality. Approaches 2 and 3 provide reasonably similar approximate estimates of the mortality increase had snus not been available, but have differing advantages and disadvantages. Only Approach 3 considers tobacco history, but develops histories using tobacco transition probabilities, which is possibly less reliable than using estimated tobacco prevalences at each follow-up year.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Yes,Yes,['Philip Morris International'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We investigated the associations between exposure to EC advertising and susceptibility to EC use in adolescents who had never used cigarettes or ECs, with potential mediation by attitudes towards ECs and the tobacco industry. METHODS: The School-based Smoking Survey 2016/17 assessed exposure to EC advertising in the past 30 days, attitudes towards ECs and the tobacco industry, susceptibility to EC use, and other covariates. Generalised linear mixed models and multiple mediation analysis methods were used in data analyses. RESULTS: Among 7082 students (mean age 14.9 years), 28.8% reported exposure to EC advertising. Exposure was associated with being uncertain about the harm of EC use, being tolerant towards ECs, believing the tobacco industry is respectable, and being susceptible to EC use; the magnitudes of these associations increased with the number of types of advertising exposed (0, 1, and ≥ 2) (all p-values < 0.01). These attitudinal factors were in turn associated with EC use susceptibility (all p-values < 0.001). The perception that tobacco companies make youth smoke was not associated with the advertising exposure or EC use susceptibility. Of the total effects of EC advertising on use susceptibility, only 16.6% were mediated by attitudinal factors: perceived harm (3.1%), attitudes towards ECs (8.2%), and attitudes towards the tobacco industry (4.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Even exposure to low intensity EC advertising was associated with susceptibility to EC use in adolescents who had never used cigarettes or ECs. The association was weakly mediated by tolerant attitudes towards ECs and the tobacco industry. The government should reinforce the regulations on EC advertising to protect adolescent health.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Such information may influence the decisions of individuals who smoke, around switching to vaping, potentially affecting the overall tobacco mortality burden. Thus, it is prudent to study how news events (e.g., 2019 vaping illness epidemic) are associated with vape sales in the United States, to possibly reduce the tobacco mortality burden. METHODS: We used weekly retail sales data for e-cigarettes (30 December 2018 - 28 December 2019) from the US retail scanner data compiled by the Nielsen Company. We used an interrupted time series design with segmented regression analysis to determine immediate and longer-term impacts of individual news events (e.g. Trump administration's planned ban on some flavored vaping products) on vape sales, controlling for pre-existing trends. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, we noted a statistically significant positive relationship between vape sales and the CDC announcing an investigation into vaping-related illnesses (Change: 6.59%, Estimate: 0.066; 95% CI: 0.036, 0.092; P < 0.001). We also observed a similar positive association between vape sales and the CDC's announcement on the link between Vitamin E acetate and EVALI (Change: 2.93%, Estimate: 0.029; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.055; P < 0.05). There was a steep decline in sales after these events. CONCLUSIONS: News events may be associated with US vape sales. Findings have implications for the management of risk perceptions around vaping to improve health outcomes of tobacco users. Information-based policy instruments can be applied to balance the effects of news events that may influence vape sales.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

To better understand the most salient constructs that influence Indigenous youth decision-making around vaping, we co-created a qualitative research study with a Syilx First Nation community that was guided by the Unified Theory of Behavior (UTB). METHODS: Through semi-structured interviews and a sharing circle, we gathered the perspectives and experiences of 16 Syilx youth in British Columbia, Canada. After an initial collaborative coding and training session, the interviews were transcribed and coded by Indigenous peer researchers using Nvivo. Through both directed and conventional qualitative content analysis methods, the final conceptual framework was collaboratively developed. RESULTS: Syilx youth reported that vaping decision-making is underpinned by colonialism, and the historical disproportionate impact of the tobacco industry. The youth spoke to several individual determinants that influence intentions to vape (e.g., vaping helps you cope) and to not vape (e.g., family and community connectedness), and determinants that translate intentions to vape to decision to vape (e.g., access to vaping), and to not vape (e.g., access to trusted adults and support from the band). The youth suggested that prevention efforts must be informed by an understanding of why Indigenous youth vape and what strengthens their resolve to not vape. CONCLUSIONS: Vaping decision-making among Indigenous youth is underpinned by their cultures, contexts, and histories. To effectively address vaping among Indigenous youth, continued engagement of Indigenous youth in planning, developing, implementing, and evaluating both prevention and policies efforts is a necessity.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We aim to investigate the therapeutic potential of an analogous combination, by evaluating the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of combining nicotine salt e-cigarettes with cytisine, compared to nicotine salt e-cigarettes or cytisine only, on smoking abstinence at six months. METHODS: A pragmatic, community-based, investigator-blinded, randomised superiority trial design will be utilised. Eligible participants will be people who smoke daily (N = 800, 90% power) from throughout New Zealand, who are: aged ≥ 18 years, motivated to quit in the next two weeks, able to provide online consent, willing to use e-cigarettes and/or cytisine, and have daily access to a mobile phone. Recruitment will utilise multi-media advertising. Participants will be randomised (3:3:2 ratio) to 12 weeks of: 1) e-cigarettes (closed pod system, 3% nicotine salt, tobacco flavour) plus cytisine; 2) e-cigarettes alone, or 3) cytisine alone. All groups will receive a six-month, text-message-based behavioural support programme. The primary outcome is self-reported, biochemically verified, continuous abstinence at six months post-quit date. Secondary outcomes, measured at quit date, then one, three, six, and 12 months post-quit date, include self-reported continuous abstinence, 7-day point prevalence abstinence, cigarettes smoked per day, withdrawal and urge to smoke, time to (re)lapse, treatment use and compliance, treatment crossover, dual-use, use of other cessation products, change in e-cigarette products, continuation of product use, acceptability, change in health state, health-related quality of life, change in body mass index, adverse events, and cost per quitter. DISCUSSION: Pragmatic trials are of particular value as they reflect the 'real world' impact of interventions. The trial will provide some of the first evidence on the effectiveness of combining nicotine salt e-cigarettes with cytisine for smoking cessation, in a country with strong tobacco control policy. Findings will be incorporated into relevant systematic reviews, informing practice and policy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05311085 ClinicalTrials.gov.

This study aimed to examine current patterns and perceptions of vaping among people living in social housing in Great Britain compared with those living in other housing types. METHODS: Data were from the Smoking Toolkit Study; a nationally-representative survey conducted in 2023 (n = 23,245). Logistic regression tested cross-sectional associations between living in social (vs. other) housing and current vaping among adults; vaping frequency, device type, nicotine concentration, and source of purchase among current vapers; use of vaping products as a smoking cessation aid among past-year smokers who tried to quit; and harm perceptions of vaping products relative to cigarettes among current smokers. RESULTS: Current vaping prevalence was twice as high among adults living in social housing (19.4%) compared with those in other housing types (10.4%; OR = 2.07, 95%CI = 1.84-2.33). This was partly explained by differences in sociodemographic characteristics and smoking status; after adjustment, the odds of being a current vaper were 33% higher (ORadj=1.33, 95%CI = 1.14-1.54). Among vapers, there were no notable differences by housing tenure in vaping frequency, main device type used, usual nicotine concentration, usual source of purchase, or use as a smoking cessation aid. However, current smokers living in social housing were more likely to think vaping is more harmful than cigarettes (31.6% vs. 21.8%; ORadj=1.61, 95%CI = 1.30-1.99). CONCLUSIONS: In Great Britain, adults who live in social housing are more likely to vape than those who live in other housing types, even after accounting for their younger age and higher smoking rates. However, misperceptions about the relative harms of vaping products and tobacco are common among smokers living in social housing. Interventions addressing these misperceptions could help encourage more people living in social housing to switch from smoking to vaping and reduce smoking-related health inequalities.

Use of flavored tobacco or nicotine products is commonly cited by adults who smoke cigarettes to be important in helping them reduce or quit smoking. The purpose of this analysis was to understand the association between the levels of use of flavored oral nicotine products and smoking reduction and quitting and how reduction or quitting may differ between predominant users of fruit/other versus mint flavored oral nicotine products after six months of use. METHODS: Participants were provided with their choice of a variety of forms and flavors of Rogue® nicotine products (Study Products) over a 6-month actual use period and completed online surveys assessing tobacco, nicotine and Study Product use at Baseline and Months 1, 2, 4, and 6 thereafter. RESULTS: Among the 1393 participants at Month 6, 41.4% and 52.5% used predominantly fruit/other or mint Study Product flavors, respectively. Compared to predominant mint users, predominant fruit/other users had greater cigarette reduction (mean reduction: 50.0% vs. 48.4%) and a higher proportion had quit smoking (proportion quit: 15.4% vs. 11.6%) at Month 6. Additionally, 38.8% of predominant fruit/other users and 39.3% of predominant mint users reduced their cigarette consumption by ≥ 50% from Baseline. Increased use of fruit/other flavors was independently associated with smoking reduction (8.6% greater reduction per 10 pieces/day; p < 0.001) and odds of quitting smoking (OR = 1.29 [95% CI: 1.04-1.59] per 10 pieces/day; p = 0.017). Increased use of mint flavors was independently associated with smoking reduction (7.5% greater reduction per 10 mint pieces/day; p < 0.001) but not with odds of quitting smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Increased use of either fruit/other or mint flavored Study Products at Month 6 was associated with significantly increased smoking reduction, whereas only increased use of fruit/other flavors was associated with greater odds of quitting smoking among participants in the study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was observational. Participants were not prospectively assigned to one or more health-related interventions and could choose to use or not use the commercially available study products provided during the study.

For adults who smoke and are unable or unwilling to quit all tobacco, switching completely from cigarettes to lower-risk smoke-free tobacco products, may reduce the health risks associated with tobacco use. In this review, we summarize epidemiological findings and provide evidence about the potential risk differential between cigarette smoking and the use of oral smoke-free tobacco products used in the US, Sweden, and Norway. Due to the wide range of compositions and health risks associated with ST products around the world and to provide evidence most relevant to the US and Western European populations, we focused on epidemiological studies conducted in these regions only. METHODS: We used a two-stage approach to obtain recent risk estimates from relevant publications. First, we identified relevant meta-analyses and systematic reviews published from Jan. 2000- Feb. 2022. Second, we identified relevant individual studies published subsequent to the most recent meta-analysis or systematic review. Studies were selected using pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. All eligible studies were assessed using National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Study Quality Assessment Tools. The relative risk estimates (RR) are reported compared to nonusers. RESULTS: Our search identified 25 systematic reviews. Meta-analyses consistently showed large and statistically robust RRs for cigarette smoking and lung cancer (i.e., RR ranging from 10.1 to 14.6), whereas no statistically significant associations (null associations) were observed for ST products used in the US, Sweden, and Norway, congruent with the lack of pulmonary exposure with the use of oral tobacco products. For COPD, mouth cancer, and heart diseases, we consistently observed higher RRs for cigarette smoking compared to using these ST products. Findings from individual studies are generally in line with these results. Importantly, a few studies documented those individuals who stopped cigarette smoking and used ST products from these regions (i.e., individuals who switched) had lower risks of lung cancer, mouth cancer, and heart diseases compared to those who continued to smoke. We identified no such studies for COPD, yet the risk estimates were generally comparable between those who switched and those who quit all tobacco products. CONCLUSION: Findings from our literature review suggest that, relative to continued smoking, switching from cigarette smoking to the ST products commonly used in the US, Sweden, and Norway is associated with reduced risks of lung cancer, mouth cancer, COPD, and tobacco-related heart diseases. Future longitudinal studies that directly measure switching behavior will provide further evidence about the potential benefits of switching and the magnitude of the harm reduction potential.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Yes,Yes,['Altria'],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

Nigeria, with a large proportion of young people, is now considering regulating e-cigarettes. This qualitative study aimed to provide insight into the factors that could influence such regulation. METHODS: Three participants were recruited using purposive sampling and interviewed as representatives of potential Nigerian e-cigarette regulators. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five factors that could influence e-cigarette regulations in Nigeria were identified i.e., existing regulatory framework; research evidence; public health considerations; economic considerations; and e-cigarette industry. CONCLUSION: The young population of Nigeria and WHO recommendations on regulation of e-cigarettes provides stimulus for Nigerian authorities to impose some form of regulation of e-cigarettes in Nigeria. Adhering to the Nigerian regulatory framework requires compliance with existing policies, and multiple stakeholder consultation. The involvement of multiple stakeholders can be beneficial for inclusivity but may introduce three competing interests, public health, economic, and industry interest, which may conflict and unduly influence e-cigarette regulations in Nigeria. Regulators should prioritise regulatory measures that serve the most essential needs of the population. The findings of this research is beneficial to decision makers as it can help with regulatory preparedness by promoting factors with positive potential to help Nigeria meet its regulatory responsibilities while minimizing factors that do the opposite.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, the potential mechanism underlying the increased transport and nicotine accumulation capacity in hybrids remain poorly understood. RESULTS: The purpose of this study was to reveal the regulatory role of the key gene NtGSTU10, which was identified during the early stages of nicotine heterosis. NtGSTU10-over expression lines were created through genetic transformation, and the nicotinic content, transport coefficient, and heterosis of NtGSTU10-over expression lines and wild-type tobacco plants were compared. The results suggested that the nicotine content in the leaves of V×OB7 (The over expression hybrids were produced by crossing Va116 as the female parent with OB7 as the male parent.) and V×OB12 (The over expression hybrids were produced by crossing Va116 as the female parent with OB12 as the male parent.) was significantly higher than that of the wild-type hybrid (V×B). Compared to the V×B, the nicotine transport coefficients of V×OB7 and V×OB12 were significantly increased by 39.50% and 40.67%, respectively; and nicotine heterosis was significantly increased by 120.07% and 127.59%, respectively. Further analysis showed that overexpression of the NtGSTU10 gene could result in up-regulated expression of genes related to nicotine synthesis (AOC, QS, ODC, and PAO) and transport (ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCC2), as well as down-regulation of negative regulatory factors (ERF1, ETR, and JAZ). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that overexpression of the NtGSTU10 gene promotes the synthesis and transport metabolism of nicotine in tobacco, positively contributing to increased nicotine content in hybrids. The research findings provide a molecular basis for regulating the nicotine transport and accumulation in hybrids, and also provide genetic resources for the targeted cultivation of new tobacco varieties with suitable nicotine content.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Between March 6, 2021 and December 17, 2021, adult patients (≥ 18 years) admitted to six hospitals affiliated with the Medical University of South Carolina were screened for smoking status. The hospitals ranged in size from 82 to 715 beds. Those currently smoking were automatically referred to one of two tobacco treatment options: 1) Enhanced care (EC) where patients could receive a bedside consult by a trained tobacco treatment specialist plus an automated post-discharge follow-up call designed to connect those smoking to the South Carolina Quitline (SCQL); or 2) Basic care (BC) consisting of the post-discharge follow-up call only. An attempt was made to survey patients at 6-weeks after hospitalization to assess smoking status. RESULTS: Smoking prevalence ranged from 14 to 49% across the six hospitals; 6,000 patients were referred to the TTP.The delivery of the bedside consult varied across the hospitals with the lowest in the Charleston hospitals which had the highest caseload of referred patients per specialist. Among patients who received a consult visit during their hospitalization, 50% accepted the consult, 8% opted out, 3% claimed not to be current smokers, and 38% were unavailable at the time of the consult visit. Most of those enrolled in the TTP were long-term daily smokers.Forty-three percent of patients eligible for the automated post-discharge follow-up call answered the call, of those, 61% reported smoking in the past seven days, and of those, 34% accepted the referral to theSCQL. Among the 986 of patients surveyed at 6-weeks after hospitalization quit rates ranged from 20%-30% based on duration of reported cessation and were similar between hospitals and for patients assigned to EC versus BC intervention groups. CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate the broad reach of an opt-out TTP.

Fortunately, several new technologies that vaporize nicotine or tobacco, and may make cigarettes obsolete, have recently appeared. Research priorities include the effects of vaporizers on smoking cessation and initiation, their safety and toxicity, use by non-smokers, dual use of vaporizers and cigarettes, passive vaping, renormalization of smoking, and the development of messages that effectively communicate the continuum of risk for tobacco and nicotine products. A major difficulty is that we are chasing a moving target. New products constantly appear, and research results are often obsolete by the time they are published. Vaporizers do not need to be safe, only safer than cigarettes. However, harm reduction principles are often misunderstood or rejected. In the context of a fierce ideological debate, and major investments by the tobacco industry, it is crucial that independent researchers provide regulators and the public with evidence-based guidance. The methodological and ideological hurdles on this path are discussed in this commentary.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

A cross-sectional and longitudinal survey.,"BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised that observing other people using e-cigarettes may undermine motivation to quit by renormalising smoking. This study aimed to explore associations between regular exposure to other people's e-cigarette use and motivation to stop smoking and quit attempts in smokers. METHODS: Data were from 12,787 smokers in England who participated in the Smoking Toolkit Study between November 2014 and May 2018. At baseline, respondents were asked whether anyone other than themselves regularly used an e-cigarette in their presence, whether they had made a quit attempt in the past year and how motivated they were to stop. Data at 6-month follow-up were available for 1580 respondents, who reported on whether they had attempted to quit in the past 6 months. RESULTS: Smokers who reported regular exposure to e-cigarette use by others were more likely than those who did not to have tried to stop smoking in the past year (32.3% vs. 26.8%; unadjusted RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11-1.31) and have high motivation to quit (16.6% vs. 14.2%; unadjusted RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.30) but were not significantly more or less likely to make a quit attempt over the subsequent 6 months (34.4% vs. 31.3%; unadjusted RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88-1.38). In models that adjusted for participants' own current e-cigarette use and unadjusted and adjusted models excluding current e-cigarette users from the sample, there were no significant associations between exposure to e-cigarette use by others and past quit attempts (RR 0.97-1.00), high current motivation to quit (RR 0.97-1.00) or prospective quit attempts (RR 0.94-1.12). In contrast, exposure to use of cigarettes was associated with low motivation to quit even after adjustment (RR 0.89) but not with quit attempts. Participants' own use of e-cigarette was strongly associated with high motivation to quit (RR 1.95) and past quit attempts (RR 2.14) and appeared to account for the bivariate associations with reported exposure to e-cigarettes. CONCLUSION: Smokers who report regular exposure to other people using e-cigarettes are more likely to report past quit attempts and high current motivation to quit, but there does not appear to be an independent association with motivation or quit attempts after adjustment for their own current use of e-cigarettes. In contrast, reported exposure to other people using cigarettes was independently and negatively associated with high motivation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The efficacy and safety of varenicline for vaping cessation has not been studied and rigorous research is required to advance best practice and outcomes for people who use electronic cigarettes (EC) and want to quit. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of varenicline (1 mg BID, administered for 12 weeks, with follow-up to week 24) combined with vaping cessation counseling in exclusive daily EC users intending to quit vaping. METHODS: Design: Double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: The study took place at a University-run smoking cessation center. PARTICIPANTS: People who exclusively use ECs daily and intend to quit vaping. INTERVENTION: A total of 140 subjects were randomized to either varenicline (1 mg, administered twice daily for 12 weeks) plus counseling or placebo treatment (administered twice daily, for 12 weeks) plus counseling. The trial consisted of a 12-week treatment phase followed by a 12-week follow-up, nontreatment phase. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was biochemically validated continuous abstinence rate (CAR) at weeks 4 to 12. Secondary efficacy end points were CAR at weeks 4 to 24 and 7-day point prevalence of vaping abstinence at weeks 12 and 24. RESULTS: CAR was significantly higher for varenicline vs placebo at each interval: weeks 4-12, 40.0% and 20.0%, respectively (OR = 2.67, 95% CI = [1.25-5.68], P = 0.011); weeks 4-24, 34.3% for varenicline with counseling and 17.2% for placebo with counseling (OR = 2.52, 95% CI = [1.14-5.58], P = 0.0224). The 7-day point prevalence of vaping abstinence was also higher for the varenicline than placebo at each time point. Serious adverse events were infrequent in both groups and not treatment-related. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present RCT indicate that inclusion of varenicline in a vaping cessation program for people who use electronic cigarettes and intending to quit may result in prolonged abstinence. These positive findings establish a benchmark of intervention effectiveness, may support the use of varenicline combined with counseling in vaping cessation programs, and may also help guiding future recommendations by health authorities and healthcare providers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study has been registered in EUDRACT with Trial registration ID: 2016-000339-42.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

A monthly population study in England, 2017-2022.","BACKGROUND: Studies conducted during the early stages of the pandemic documented mixed changes in smoking behaviour: more smokers quitting successfully but little change in prevalence. This study aimed to examine whether there have been sustained impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking patterns in England. METHODS: Data were from 101,960 adults (≥ 18 years) participating in the Smoking Toolkit Study, a monthly representative household survey, between June 2017 and August 2022. Interviews were conducted face-to-face until March 2020 and via telephone thereafter. Generalised additive models estimated associations of the pandemic onset (March 2020) with current smoking, uptake, cessation, quit attempts, and use of support. Models adjusted for seasonality, sociodemographic characteristics, and (where relevant) dependence and tobacco control mass-media expenditure. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, smoking prevalence fell by 5.2% per year; this rate of decline slowed to 0.3% per year during the pandemic (RRΔtrend = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.09). This slowing was evident in more but not less advantaged social grades (RRΔtrend = 1.15, 1.08, 1.21; RRΔtrend = 1.00, 0.96, 1.05). There were sustained step-level changes in different age groups: a 34.9% (95% CI = 17.7, 54.7%) increase in smoking prevalence among 18-24-year-olds, indicating a potential rise in uptake, in contrast to a 13.6% (95% CI = 4.4, 21.9%) decrease among 45-65-year-olds. In both age groups, these step-level changes were followed by the pre-pandemic declines stopping, and prevalence remaining flat. There were sustained increases in quitting among past-year smokers, with a 120.4% (95% CI = 79.4, 170.9%) step-level increase in cessation and a 41.7% (95% CI = 29.7, 54.7%) increase in quit attempts. The main limitation was the change in modality of data collection when the pandemic started; while this may have contributed to the step-level changes we observed, it is unlikely to explain changes in the slope of trends. CONCLUSIONS: In England, the rate of decline in adult smoking prevalence stagnated during the COVID-19 pandemic through to 2022. At the start of the pandemic, a potential reduction in smoking prevalence among middle-aged adults and increases in quitting among smokers may have been offset by an increase in smoking among young adults. The slowing in the rate of decline was pronounced in more advantaged social grades.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study explored trends by socioeconomic position in patterns of smoking, use of non-combustible nicotine products, and quitting activity among women of reproductive age in England. METHODS: Data come from a nationally representative monthly cross-sectional survey. Between October 2013 and October 2023, 197,266 adults (≥ 18 years) were surveyed, of whom 44,052 were women of reproductive age (18-45 years). Main outcome measures were current smoking, vaping, and use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), heated tobacco products (HTPs), and nicotine pouches; mainly/exclusively smoking hand-rolled cigarettes and level of dependence among current smokers; past-year quit attempts among past-year smokers; and success of quit attempts among those who tried to quit. We modelled time trends in these outcomes, overall and by occupational social grade (ABC1 = more advantaged/C2DE = less advantaged). RESULTS: Smoking prevalence among women of reproductive age fell from 28.7% [95%CI = 26.3-31.2%] to 22.4% [19.6-25.5%] in social grades C2DE but there was an uncertain increase from 11.7% [10.2-13.5%] to 14.9% [13.4-16.6%] in ABC1. By contrast, among all adults and among men of the same age, smoking prevalence remained relatively stable in ABC1. Vaping prevalence among women of reproductive age more than tripled, from 5.1% [4.3-6.0%] to 19.7% [18.0-21.5%], with the absolute increase more pronounced among those in social grades C2DE (reaching 26.7%; 23.3-30.3%); these changes were larger than those observed among all adults but similar to those among men of the same age. The proportion of smokers mainly/exclusively smoking hand-rolled cigarettes increased from 40.5% [36.3-44.9%] to 61.4% [56.5-66.1%] among women of reproductive age; smaller increases were observed among all adults and among men of the same age. Patterns on other outcomes were largely similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among women of reproductive age, there appears to have been a rise in smoking prevalence in the more advantaged social grades over the past decade. Across social grades, there have been substantial increases in the proportion of women of reproductive age who vape and shifts from use of manufactured to hand-rolled cigarettes among those who smoke. These changes have been more pronounced than those observed in the general adult population over the same period.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study estimated trends between 2013 and 2024 in vaping among ex-smokers, overall and among those who did not use e-cigarettes to support their quit attempt. METHODS: Data were collected via nationally-representative, monthly cross-sectional surveys in England, October 2013 to May 2024. We analysed data from 54,251 adults (≥ 18y) who reported having tried to stop smoking in the past year or having stopped smoking more than a year ago. Logistic regression estimated associations between time and e-cigarette use. RESULTS: Across the period, there were increases in the use of e-cigarettes to support attempts to stop smoking (from 26.9% [24.0-30.0%] in October 2013 to 41.4% [37.7-45.2%] in May 2024), in current vaping among ≥ 1y ex-smokers (1.9% [1.5-2.5%] to 20.4% [18.7-22.2%]), and in late uptake of vaping after smoking cessation (i.e., current vaping among people who quit smoking before e-cigarettes started to become popular in 2011; 0.4% [0.2-0.8%] to 3.7% [2.8-4.9%]). These increases were non-linear, with much of the difference occurring since mid-2021, and were greatest at younger ages (e.g., current vaping among ≥ 1y ex-smokers reached 58.9% among 18-year-olds vs. 10.7% among 65-year-olds). CONCLUSIONS: Vaping prevalence increased substantially among adult ex-smokers in England over the past decade, particularly at younger ages. While this is likely to have been largely driven by increased use of e-cigarettes in quit attempts and continued use thereafter, there was also evidence of increased uptake of vaping among those who had been abstinent from smoking for many years.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

METHODS: Data were collected as part of a representative monthly cross-sectional household survey in England between April 2014 and April 2024 (n = 197,219). We analysed differences between older (≥ 65 years) and younger/middle-aged adults (18-64 years) in (a) time trends in tobacco smoking and vaping, (b) harm perceptions of e-cigarettes vs. cigarettes (adjusting for gender, socioeconomic position, and vaping status), and (c) the real-world effectiveness of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation (adjusting for gender, socioeconomic position, characteristics of the quit attempt, and use of other evidence-based cessation aids). RESULTS: Tobacco smoking prevalence remained relatively unchanged over time among older adults (at ~ 9%; 9.5% [8.5-10.6%] in April 2014 and 8.7% [7.7-9.8%] in April 2024) but vaping prevalence increased (from 2.1% [1.6-2.7%] to 3.7% [3.0-4.6%], respectively). These trends differed from those observed among younger/middle-aged adults, among whom there was a clear decline in smoking (from 21.8% [21.0-22.7%] to 18.2% [17.3-19.0%]) and a larger increase in vaping (from 5.6% [5.2-6.1%] to 16.2% [15.3-17.0%]). Older adults were consistently less likely than younger/middle-aged adults to use e-cigarettes to support attempts to quit smoking (26.8% [17.2-39.3%] vs. 43.7% [39.6-48.0%] in April 2024). Older smokers reported greater uncertainty about the harms of e-cigarettes compared with cigarettes (ORadj = 2.48 [2.28-2.69]). E-cigarettes appeared to be effective for helping older adults to stop smoking (ORadj = 1.50 [0.96-2.34]); whether effectiveness was lower than for younger/middle-aged adults was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past decade, smoking prevalence has remained stable among older adults while decreasing among the rest of the adult population in England. Older adults are more unsure about the relative harms of e-cigarettes and less likely to use them to support attempts to quit smoking, despite evidence that they are effective for smoking cessation in this population.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, the conventional conditioned stimuli used in retrieval-extinction training have limitations in lack of contextual and selective activation of memories, which limits intervention efficacy and clinical translation. Therefore, we developed a novel imagery-based retrieval-extinction training (I-RE) and examined its effects on nicotine addiction. METHODS: This study included 57 nicotine-dependent individuals randomly assigned to either the experimental (n = 29) or control (n = 28) group. Participants were exposed to a 5-min imagery script cue, followed by a 10-min rest period and 60-min extinction training session. Short- and long-term (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months) intervention effects were assessed via the smoking imagery vividness score, smoking craving, and daily cigarette consumption. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: Regarding short-term effects, smoking imagery vividness score [pre- vs. post-intervention: p < 0.001; pre- vs. 1-day follow-up (FU): p = 0.003] and craving significantly decreased (pre- vs. post-intervention: p < 0.001; pre- vs. 1-day FU: p < 0.001). Decreased imagery vividness score mediated decreased smoking craving induced by smoking-related I-RE. Moreover, the significant correlation observed between these variables at pre-intervention disappeared at post-intervention. For effects on EEG microstate, a significant decrease was observed in microstate C duration induced by the smoking-related imagery script cue reactivity task post-intervention (p < 0.001). This mediated a decreased smoking craving induced by smoking-related I-RE. Degree of decrease in duration was positively correlated with addict imagery ability (p = 0.035). Consistently, the microstate C occurrence rate significantly decreased during the memory reconsolidation phase (p < 0.001). Regarding long-term effects, the smoking imagery vividness score (1-week FU: p = 0.004; 1-month FU: p < 0.001), smoking craving (1-week FU: p < 0.001; 1-month FU: p < 0.001), and daily cigarette consumption (1-week FU: p < 0.001; 1-month FU: p < 0.001) significantly decreased at 1-week and 1-month FU. Furthermore, decreased smoking craving mediated decreased Daily cigarette consumption in the experimental group. The significant correlation observed between the imagery vividness score and craving at pre-intervention disappeared at the 1-week and 1-month FU. CONCLUSIONS: This novel I-RE demonstrated significant effects on nicotine addiction for 1 month after a single intervention session, suggesting that it is a promising treatment tool.

In e-cigarettes, tobacco combustion is replaced by e-liquid heating, leading some manufacturers to propose that e-cigarettes have less harmful respiratory effects than tobacco consumption. Other innovative features such as the adjustment of nicotine content and the choice of pleasant flavours have won over many users. Nevertheless, the safety of e-cigarette consumption and its potential as a smoking cessation method remain controversial due to limited evidence. Moreover, it has been reported that the heating process itself can lead to the formation of new decomposition compounds of questionable toxicity. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have been performed to better understand the impact of these new inhalable compounds on human health. Results of toxicological analyses suggest that e-cigarettes can be safer than conventional cigarettes, although harmful effects from short-term e-cigarette use have been described. Worryingly, the potential long-term effects of e-cigarette consumption have been scarcely investigated. In this review, we take stock of the main findings in this field and their consequences for human health including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

METHODS: There were 13,752 participants ≥ 40 years with Wave 1 (W1) data for prevalence analyses, including 6945 adults without COPD for incidence analyses; W1-5 (2013-2019) data were analyzed. W1 tobacco use was modeled as 12 mutually-exclusive categories of past 30-day (P30D) single and polyuse, with two reference categories (current exclusive cigarette and never tobacco). Prevalence and incidence ratios of self-reported physician-diagnosed COPD were estimated using weighted multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: W1 mean (SE) age was 58.1(0.1) years; mean cigarette pack-years was similar for all categories involving cigarettes and exclusive use of e-cigarettes (all > 20), greater than exclusive cigar users (< 10); and COPD prevalence was 7.7%. Compared to P30D cigarette use, never tobacco, former tobacco, and cigar use were associated with lower COPD prevalence (RR = 0.33, (95% confidence interval-CI) [0.26, 0.42]; RR = 0.57, CI [0.47, 0.70]; RR = 0.46, CI [0.28, 0.76], respectively); compared to never tobacco use, all categories except cigar and smokeless tobacco use were associated with higher COPD prevalence (RR former = 1.72, CI [1.33, 2.23]; RR cigarette = 3.00, CI [2.37, 3.80]; RR e-cigarette = 2.22, CI [1.44, 3.42]; RR cigarette + e-cigarette = 3.10, CI [2.39, 4.02]; RR polycombusted = 3.37, CI [2.44, 4.65]; RR polycombusted plus noncombusted = 2.75, CI]1.99, 3.81]). COPD incidence from W2-5 was 5.8%. Never and former tobacco users had lower COPD risk compared to current cigarette smokers (RR = 0.52, CI [0.35, 0.77]; RR = 0.47, CI [0.32, 0.70], respectively). Compared to never use, cigarette, smokeless, cigarette plus e-cigarette, and polycombusted tobacco use were associated with higher COPD incidence (RR = 1.92, CI [1.29, 2.86]; RR = 2.08, CI [1.07, 4.03]; RR = 1.99, CI [1.29, 3.07]; RR = 2.59, CI [1.60, 4.21], respectively); exclusive use of e-cigarettes was not (RR = 1.36, CI [0.55, 3.39]). CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarettes and all use categories involving cigarettes were associated with higher COPD prevalence compared to never use, reflecting, in part, the high burden of cigarette exposure in these groups. Cigarette-but not exclusive e-cigarette-use was also strongly associated with higher COPD incidence. Compared to cigarette use, only quitting tobacco was protective against COPD development.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Furthermore, it can be used as an advocacy tool in the fight for tobacco control and prevention of tobacco-related disease. This article builds on the evidence presented in the TKS, with a greater level of detail intended for a lung-specialist audience. Pulmonologists have a vital role to play in advocating for the health of their patients and the wider population by sharing five key messages: (1) Smoking is the leading cause of COPD in high-income countries, contributing to approximately 70% of cases. Quitting tobacco is an essential step toward better lung health. (2) People with COPD face a significantly higher risk of developing lung cancer. Smoking cessation is a powerful measure to reduce cancer risk. (3) Cardiovascular disease, lung cancer and type-2 diabetes are common comorbidities in people with COPD. Quitting smoking not only improves COPD management, but also reduces the risk of developing these coexisting conditions. (4) Tobacco smoke also significantly impacts children's lung growth and development, increasing the risk of respiratory infections, asthma and up to ten other conditions, and COPD later in life. Governments should implement effective tobacco control measures to protect vulnerable populations. (5) The tobacco industry's aggressive strategies in the marketing of nicotine delivery systems and all tobacco products specifically target children, adolescents, and young adults. Protecting our youth from these harmful tactics is a top priority.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

METHODS: Re-analysis of key data sources on nicotine toxicity and prevalence of youth use of e-cigarettes cited in the Surgeon General report as the basis for its conclusions. RESULTS: Multiple years of nationally representative surveys indicate the majority of e-cigarette use among US youth is either infrequent or experimental, and negligible among never-smoking youth. The majority of the very small proportion of US youth who use e-cigarettes on a regular basis, consume nicotine-free products. The sharpest declines in US youth smoking rates have occurred as e-cigarettes have become increasingly available. Most of the evidence presented in the Surgeon General's discussion of nicotine harm is not applicable to e-cigarette use, because it relies almost exclusively on exposure to nicotine in the cigarette smoke and not to nicotine present in e-cigarette aerosol emissions. Moreover, the referenced literature describes effects in adults, not youth, and in animal models that have little relevance to real-world e-cigarette use by youth. The Surgeon General's report is an excellent reference document for the adverse outcomes due to nicotine in combination with several other toxicants present in tobacco smoke, but fails to address the risks of nicotine decoupled from tobacco smoke constituents. The report exaggerates the toxicity of propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG) by focusing on experimental conditions that do not reflect use in the real-world and provides little discussion of emerging evidence that e-cigarettes may significantly reduce harm to smokers who have completely switched. CONCLUSIONS: The U.S. Surgeon General's claim that e-cigarette use among U.S. youth and young adults is an emerging public health concern does not appear to be supported by the best available evidence on the health risks of nicotine use and population survey data on prevalence of frequent e-cigarette use. Nonetheless, patterns of e-cigarettes use in youth must be constantly monitored for early detection of significant changes. The next US Surgeon General should consider the possibility that future generations of young Americans will be less likely to start smoking tobacco because of, not in spite of, the availability of e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: Using a naturalistic approach, we sought to understand how the current law was experienced by e-cigarette users (vapers). Twenty-nine vapers were interviewed by telephone, between May and September 2016, using a semi-structured interview schedule. Open-ended questions covered: initiating vaping, the experience of stopping smoking, technical problems encountered, reasons for vaping, acceptability of vaping, addiction to vaping and advice given to smokers about vaping. The audio recordings were transcribed and then independently coded using a general inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: This paper presents the main theme which was that vapers employed a range of reactionary strategies to the ban on the sale of nicotine e-liquid in NZ. These included lobbying government, spreading the word, establishing vaper support groups, helping people stop smoking by switching to vaping and advocating for e-cigarettes to be incorporated into smoking cessation practice. CONCLUSIONS: Vapers' experience and observations form a popular or lay epidemiology--one that identified that e-cigarettes were helping people stop smoking and could thus deliver public health benefits. Public health researchers and workers, and government fears about vaping, and proposals to strengthen restrictions contributed to the growth of the vaper community who reacted by forming self-help groups and providing alternative cessation support to smokers. For a significant switch from smoking to vaping to occur, the health sector needs to have a change of attitude towards vaping that is positive, and the public needs evidence-based information on vaping. A first step could be for the health sector to collaborate with the vaping community to reorient current tobacco control and cessation practice to encourage smokers to switch to less harmful smoke-free alternatives to smoking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This paper explores the history of the establishment of these warnings with emphasis on the 'not a safe alternative' warning and the bases for claiming that smokeless was 'not safe' (absolute harm) versus 'not safer than cigarettes' (relative harm). METHODS: Results of searches of Truth Tobacco Industry Document archives and transcripts of legislative hearings were analyzed. Critical assessments were made of the evidence-base. RESULTS: New evidence of oral cancer causation emerged along with a much-publicized case of a teenager dying of oral cancer. Public health concerns also arose over a widespread, successful marketing campaign implying smokeless was a safe alternative to cigarettes. Industry wanted pre-emptive federal warnings, to prevent a diversity of pending state warnings. To avoid an addiction warning, the industry accepted a compromise 'not a safe alternative' warning, which had not been initially proposed and which the cigarette industry may have sought in order to constrain the smokeless tobacco industry. The evidence presented supported smokeless only as 'not safe' and not 'as harmful as cigarette smoking.' CONCLUSIONS: The comparative warning was a compromise to prevent an addiction warning and consistent with the preferences of cigarette companies. Prior surveys indicated that the public generally did not view smokeless tobacco as harmless, but they did generally report smokeless as less harmful than cigarettes despite expert interpretations to the contrary. As would not have been appreciated by public health supporters at the outset, subsequent research has shown that the 'not a safe alternative' message is misinterpreted by consumers to indicate that smokeless is 'not safer' than cigarettes-which was not established and has been disconfirmed by subsequent assessments of that question. Though many countries have banned smokeless tobacco (but not cigarettes), where smokeless is legally available accurate information on the nature of harms and differential harms needs to be developed.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The purpose of the study was to assess the first e-cigarette flavor and current e-cigarette flavors used by a large non-probabilistic sample of adult frequent users of e-cigarettes in the USA and assess how flavor preferences vary by cigarette smoking status and time since first e-cigarette purchase. METHODS: An online survey assessed the first e-cigarette flavor and current e-cigarette flavors used by a non-probabilistic sample of 20,836 adult frequent e-cigarette users in the USA. Differences in e-cigarette flavor preferences between current smokers, former smokers, and never-smokers and trends in the first flavor used across time of e-cigarette use initiation were assessed. RESULTS: The majority (n = 15,807; 76.4%) of sampled frequent e-cigarette users had completely substituted e-cigarettes for conventional cigarettes-""switchers""-and were currently using rechargeable, refillable vaping devices. Among them, the proportion of first e-cigarette purchases that were fruit-flavored increased from 17.8% of first purchases made before 2011 to 33.5% of first purchases made between June 2015 and June 2016. Tobacco-flavored first purchases almost halved during this time (46.0% pre-2011 to 24.0% between 2015 and 2016). Fruit/fruit beverage (73.9 to 82.9% of sampled users), dessert/pastry (63.5 to 68.5% of sampled users), and candy, chocolate, or sweets (48.7 to 53.4% of sampled users) were the most popular currently used e-cigarette flavors. Tobacco and menthol flavors, the two most popular flavors for initiating e-cigarette use prior to 2013, now rank as the 5th and 6th most popular currently used e-cigarette flavors, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adult frequent e-cigarette users in the USA who have completely switched from smoking cigarettes to using e-cigarettes are increasingly likely to have initiated e-cigarette use with non-tobacco flavors and to have transitioned from tobacco to non-tobacco flavors over time. Restricting access to non-tobacco e-cigarette flavors may discourage smokers from attempting to switch to e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Currently, the profiles of key tobacco compounds in legal and illegal cigarettes are largely unknown. We aimed to analyze and compare concentrations of nicotine, nitrosamines, and humectants in legal and illegal cigarettes collected from a representative sample of smokers. METHODS: Participants of the International Tobacco Control cohort provided a cigarette pack of the brand they smoked during the 2014 wave. Brands were classified as legal or illegal according to the Mexican legislation. Nicotine, nitrosamines, glycerol, propylene glycol, and pH were quantified in seven randomly selected packs of each brand. All analyses were done blinded to legality status. Average concentrations per brand and global averages for legal and illegal brands were calculated. Comparisons between legal and illegal brands were conducted using t tests. RESULTS: Participants provided 76 different brands, from which 6.8% were illegal. Legal brands had higher nicotine (15.05 ± 1.89 mg/g vs 12.09 ± 2.69 mg/g; p < 0001), glycerol (12.98 ± 8.03 vs 2.93 ± 1.96 mg/g; p < 0.001), and N-nitrosanatabine (NAT) (1087.5 ± 127.0 vs 738.5 ± 338 ng/g; p = 0.006) concentrations compared to illegal brands. For all other compounds, legal and illegal brands had similar concentrations. CONCLUSION: Compared to illegal cigarettes, legal brands seem to have higher concentrations of nicotine, NAT, and glycerol. Efforts must be made to implement and enforce Article 10 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control to provide transparent information to consumers, regulators, and policy-makers; and to limit cigarette engineering from the tobacco industry.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Assessing the effect of JUUL vapor products on adult smokers' use of conventional tobacco cigarettes can help inform the potential population health impact of these products. METHODS: Online surveys assessed past 30-day use of conventional cigarettes, JUUL vapor products, and other e-cigarettes/vapor products, monthly for 3 months, in a non-probabilistic sample of 15,456 US adults (21+ years). Participants were established current smokers of conventional cigarettes and recruited at their first purchase of a JUUL Starter Kit in a retail store or through JUUL's website. Logistic regression models examined factors associated with participants' odds of reporting past 30-day abstinence from cigarette smoking at the 3-months assessment. RESULTS: Past 30-day smoking abstinence at the 3-months assessment was reported by 28.3% of the intent-to-treat (ITT) sample (n = 15,456) and 47.1% of an efficacy subset sample that completed the 3-months assessment (n = 9272). Covariate-adjusted odds for reporting past 30-day smoking abstinence at the 3-months assessment were significantly higher among participants who primarily used Mint or Mango flavored JUULpods (versus Virginia Tobacco flavor) in the past 30 days; exclusively used JUULpods in characterizing flavors (versus tobacco flavors) in the past 30 days; used a JUUL vaporizer on all 30 of the past 30 days; purchased their first JUUL vaporizer in a retail store (versus online); and first purchased a JUUL Starter Kit to help quit smoking completely. Odds for reporting past 30-day smoking abstinence were significantly lower among participants who, at study enrolment, had smoked regularly for ≥ 20 years, smoked ≥ 20 cigarettes per day, and smoked on all 30 of the previous 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: At least 28.3% of adult smokers had quit smoking cigarettes completely after using a JUUL vaporizer for 3 months. More frequent use of a JUUL vaporizer and primary use of JUULpods containing characterizing flavors, particularly Mint and Mango, appears to be important to new JUUL users' chances of quitting smoking.

Assessing the effect of JUUL vapor products on adult smokers' use of conventional tobacco cigarettes can help inform the potential population health impact of these products. METHODS: Participants were 15,456 US adult established current smokers aged 21 years who had purchased their first JUUL Starter Kit from a retail store or online within the past 7 days. Online surveys assessed past 30-day use of conventional cigarettes, JUUL vapor products, and other e-cigarettes/vapor products at 3 and 6 months after their first JUUL purchase. Logistic regression models examined factors associated with smokers' odds of self-reporting past 30-day abstinence from cigarette smoking at 6 months. RESULTS: Past 30-day point prevalence abstinence from smoking at 6 months was 31.6% in the intent-to-treat (ITT) sample and 54.0% among those who responded at 6 months (n = 9040; 58.5% of ITT). Consecutive past 30-day smoking abstinence outcomes at 3 and 6 months were reported by 20.3% of the ITT sample and 40.6% of responders to both assessments (n = 7726). Covariate-adjusted odds for reporting past 30-day smoking abstinence at 6 months were significantly higher among primary users of mint- or mango-flavored JUULpods (compared to primary users of Virginia tobacco-flavored JUULpods), exclusive users of JUULpods in characterizing flavors (compared to exclusive users of tobacco-flavored JUULpods), daily users of the JUUL vaporizer (compared to less-than-daily), initial retail purchasers (compared to initial e-commerce purchasers), and those who first purchased a JUUL to help to quit smoking completely. Odds for reporting past 30-day smoking abstinence were significantly lower among those who, at study enrolment, had smoked regularly for ≥ 20 years, smoked ≥ 10 cigarettes per day, and smoked on all 30 of the previous 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Around one third of enrolled smokers and one half of smokers who responded to a 6-month follow-up reported being past 30-day abstinent from cigarette smoking after using a JUUL vaporizer for 6 months. More frequent use of a JUUL vaporizer and primary use of JUULpods in characterizing flavors, particularly mint and mango, appeared to be important to smokers' chances of quitting.

The substantial harms of smoking during pregnancy are well established and there is reason to believe that nicotine alone is somewhat harmful. Differences in the exposure chemistry strongly suggest that the effects of using smoke-free nicotine products (including pharmaceutical nicotine products, smokeless tobacco, and electronic cigarettes containing nicotine) fall somewhere in the range between zero risk to the risk from smoking. How much lower risk these consumption choices are in terms of pregnancy outcomes, however, remains uncertain. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on smoke-free nicotine and tobacco product exposure and birth-outcome endpoints. Studies were included if they compared outcomes to either no nicotine use or smoking. We searched Google Scholar using broad search terms and additional articles were snowballed from citations. We report what could be learned from each study, given its methods. RESULTS: Of the 21 studies reviewed, 12 reported on the use of nicotine replacement therapies, 7 on Swedish snus, 1 on Alaskan iq'mik, and 1 on e-cigarettes. The range of results tends to support the prediction that smoke-free product use during pregnancy probably increases the risk of some negative birth outcomes, but that any effect is less than that from smoking. However, the limitations of epidemiology are such that no more-precise a conclusion is possible. DISCUSSION: The available epidemiology does not change our prior beliefs, based on other evidence and knowledge, that the risks from smoke-free nicotine and tobacco are lower than those for smoking, though it suggests they are non-zero. However, it also demonstrates that the epidemiology is unlikely to provide precise quantitative estimates. This is not just a matter of lack of studies; given the inherent limitation of these studies, doubling or tripling the corpus of available studies would add little precision. For the foreseeable future, decisions about using these products will need to be made based on rough estimates, based on a variety of forms of evidence, and qualitative comparisons.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

IQOS was introduced to the UK in 2016, and there is little independent qualitative research on IQOS harm perceptions. This study explored the perceived health harms of IQOS to users and those exposed to the emissions, what shapes these perceptions, and what participants wanted to know about the harms of IQOS. METHODS: Qualitative interviews in London, UK, with 30 adult current and former IQOS users who currently smoked or quit smoking in the last 2 years. RESULTS: IQOS was perceived as less harmful than smoking but not risk-free, although there was great uncertainty. Influences on harm perceptions were consolidated into six themes: (1) dominance of manufacturer claims influenced perceptions that IQOS is less harmful than smoking to users and those around them, although mistrust of the tobacco industry heightened scepticism about harms; (2) limited independent and long-term research led to uncertainty about harms, although some participants trusted IQOS would not be marketed if it were very harmful. Participants wanted more independent and long-term studies into harm; (3) appearance of HEETS (tobacco sticks) packaging conveyed reduced harm because packets were 'pretty', without graphic/specific warnings, although written warnings conveyed some harm. Participants wanted more information on HEETS packets about harms; (4) process of heating and HEETS contents-heating, compared with burning, tobacco was perceived to produce fewer harmful chemicals, while tobacco, nicotine, and chemicals in HEETS were perceived to cause some harm. Participants wanted clarification about the harms of heating tobacco and HEETS ingredients; (5) improvements in physical health and personal appearance reduced perceptions of harm; (6) differences in sensory experiences (taste, sight, smell) when using IQOS over smoking reduced perceptions of harm, while 'black' deposits inside IQOS led to perceptions of some harm. Reduced volume and smell of IQOS emissions also reduced perceptions of harm to non-users exposed to the emissions. CONCLUSIONS: IQOS was perceived as less harmful than smoking but not risk-free, although there was great uncertainty. Participants wanted clarification about IQOS harms from independent sources in accessible forms, specifically related to HEETS ingredients, heating tobacco, and emissions to others.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

This systematic quality review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and AMSTAR (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) 2 to evaluate the quality of systematic reviews investigating potential associations between e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched from 01 January 2007 to 24 June 2020. Methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR 2, and reporting quality was assessed using PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Of 331 potentially relevant systematic reviews, 20 met predefined inclusion criteria. Most reviews (n = 15; 75%) reported on e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking cessation, while three reported on e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking initiation (15%); and two reported on cigarette smoking initiation and cessation (10%). According to AMSTAR 2 guidelines, 18 of the 20 reviews (90%) were ""critically low"" in overall confidence of the results, while two were ranked ""low."" Additionally, reporting quality varied across the reviews, with only 60% reporting at least half of the PRISMA items. DISCUSSION: Methodological limitations were identified across reviews examining potential associations between e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking behaviors, indicating that findings from these reviews should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: Future systematic reviews in this field should strive to adhere to AMSTAR 2 and PRISMA guidelines, to provide high quality syntheses of the available data with transparent and complete reporting.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Post-cessation, loss of such effects (including temporary deficits in cognitive function) have been cited as reasons for resumption of smoking. The effects of e-cigarettes and nicotine delivered by e-cigarettes on these functions have not been widely researched but may play a role in the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a satisfactory alternative to combustible cigarettes for people who smoke, and in encouraging individuals who would otherwise continue to smoke, to transition to e-cigarettes. METHODS: The study was an exploratory, randomised, partially-blinded, single-centre, five-arm crossover trial that recruited 40 healthy male and female people who smoke. At 5 study sessions, following a 12-h period of nicotine abstinence, participants were randomly assigned to use either a combustible cigarette, an e-cigarette of three varying nicotine strengths (18 mg/mL, 12 mg/mL or 0 mg/mL respectively) or observe a no product usage session. Participants completed pre- and post-product usage assessments to examine the product usage effect on cognitive performance (using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)), subjective mood and smoking urges. RESULTS: A significant improvement in sustained attention task performance was observed following use of both the nicotine containing e-cigarettes and combustible cigarette compared to no product use. Additionally, there were no significant differences between the nicotine containing products, indicating that nicotine use enhanced sustained attention regardless of delivery format. Nicotine containing e-cigarette and combustible cigarette use also significantly improved overall mood of participants compared to no product use, with no significant differences observed between the nicotine containing products. Nicotine containing e-cigarette and combustible cigarette use significantly reduced smoking urges compared to no product use, though combustible cigarette use elicited the greatest reduction in smoking urges. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the nicotine containing products improved sustained attention and mood while reducing smoking urges, with the studied e-cigarettes having comparable effects to combustible cigarettes across the assessed cognitive parameters and mood measures. These results demonstrate the potential role of e-cigarettes to provide an acceptable alternative for combustible cigarettes among people who would otherwise continue to smoke.

They assessed all included studies as having a low risk of bias, and concluded that vaping and smoking have a ""comparable"" disease odds, with dual use associated with more risk than smoking. AIM: To examine the accuracy of these conclusions, giving particular attention to myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and COPD. METHODS: We determined (1) whether the pooled random-effect estimates were correctly calculated from the ORs included, (2) whether the detailed outcomes were correctly described and appropriate and whether additional OR estimates could have been included from the studies considered, (3) whether the data were correctly extracted from the source papers, (4) whether some studies should definitely or possibly have been excluded, (5) what the pooled OR estimates were for MI, stroke and COPD after excluding definitely invalid results and restricting attention to data based on appropriate disease definitions, (6) how estimates of the excess risk (ER = OR - 1) for vaping compare to those we estimate for quitting, (7) whether various sources of bias were adequately accounted for, and (8) whether conclusions were confirmed in studies where reverse causation was not an issue, i.e. where disease onset could not have preceded uptake of vaping. RESULTS: We found no major issues regarding pooled estimation, description of diagnoses and extraction of data from the source papers, but some studies should have been excluded, and one further result was available for MI. Using data appropriately extracted for valid diagnoses, we derived pooled OR estimates for vaping vs. smoking of 0.48 (95%CI: 0.35-0.67) for MI, 0.65 (0.49-0.86) for stroke and 0.46 (0.35-0.60) for COPD. These showed a significantly reduced risk for vaping, similar to or lower than expected for quitting smoking for 5 to 10 years, highly relevant given the short period of vaping following earlier smoking for most study participants. For dual use vs. smoking, pooled OR estimates were 1.41 (1.18-1.68) for MI, 1.39 (1.06-1.82) for stroke and 1.32 (1.17-1.50) for COPD. The studies considered were predominantly cross-sectional so could not account for reverse causation, or for those who smoked and became dual users possibly having smoked more cigarettes or smoked for a longer period than those not doing so. Only three publications accounted for reverse causation, each using the same data source, and each found a significant effect of smoking, but not vaping, on the diseases considered. CONCLUSION: The claim in the original meta-analysis that the studies had a low risk of bias is demonstrably incorrect, and even the biased data suggests that switching to e-cigarettes may reduce disease risk similarly to quitting. Biases may also explain the somewhat higher risk observed in those who smoked and vaped than in those smoking exclusively. Very limited unbiased data found no significant effect of vaping on the diseases considered. Though more good studies are urgently needed, the conclusions of Glantz et al. are not supported by the currently available evidence.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Research is needed to examine longer-term switching trajectories beyond one year of follow-up. METHODS: This analysis of a previously-described longitudinal cohort study of adults who smoke and purchased JUUL focused on N = 11,153 who completed the 12-month (12 M) follow-up and ≥ 1 of 4 surveys in the second year (Y2; at 15, 18, 21, and 24 months). Outcomes were repeated point prevalence of product use over the past-30-days (P30D) at each Y2 follow-up: repeated point prevalence-switching (i.e., no P30D smoking at any available Y2 follow-ups), repeated point prevalence-smoking, or varying status. Associations between product use status at 12M (switched, exclusive smoking, or dual used) and Y2 product use patterns were examined. RESULTS: Most adults who smoked at baseline and were switched at 12 M reported repeated point prevalence-switching over Y2 (69.5%); repeated point prevalence-smoking was rare (6.2%). In contrast, > 50% of those who were smoking at 12 M (exclusively or with ENDS [JUUL or other brand]) persistently smoked over Y2. Supplementary analyses showed that among adults who exclusively used ENDS at 12 M, those who used ENDS daily were more likely to persistently switch over Y2; similarly, among adults who smoked at 12 M (either exclusively or dual-use with ENDS) those who smoked nondaily were more likely to persistently switch over Y2. Over half of adults who dual used at both 12 M and 24 M substantially reduced (i.e., by 50%+) their baseline cigarette consumption. CONCLUSIONS: For the majority of participants, product use status at 12 M was consistent with use patterns in the second year: most adults who smoked at baseline and were switched at 12 M reported repeated point prevalence-switching over Y2, while any smoking at 12 M- especially daily smoking- was usually followed by repeated point prevalence-smoking. These findings indicate that switching and smoking behavior is generally maintained and remains stable one year after purchasing ENDS.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['JUUL Labs'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) of the risk of IBD in relation to CVH status. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up 12.3 years, we documented 1,500 IBD cases (including 1,070 UC and 502 CD). Compared to participants with low CVH, the HRs (95% CIs) of those with high CVH for IBD, UC, and CD were 0.67 (0.52, 0.83), 0.70 (0.52, 0.93), and 0.55 (0.38, 0.80), respectively. These associations were not modified by genetic susceptibility (all P for interactions > 0.05). The lowest HR (UC: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.20-0.45; CD: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.20-0.57) was observed in participants with both high CVH and low genetic risk. CONCLUSIONS: Better CVH, defined by LE8, was associated with significantly lower risks of IBD, UC, and CD, irrespective of genetic predisposition. Our results underscore the importance of adherence to LE8 guidelines for maintaining CVH as a potential strategy in the prevention of IBD.",['Nicotine/NRT'],Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, U.S. Smokeless Tobacco (USST) and Swedish Match developed and marketed pouched moist snuff tobacco (MST) since 1973. METHODS: Analysis of previously secret tobacco documents, advertisements and trade press. RESULTS: USST partnered with Swedish Match, forming United Scandia International to develop pouch products as part of the ""Lotus Project."" Pouched MST was not commonly used, either in Sweden or the U.S. prior to the Lotus Project's innovation in 1973. The project aimed to transform smokeless tobacco from being perceived as an ""unsightly habit of old men"" into a relevant, socially acceptable urban activity, targeting 15-35 year-old men. While USST's initial pouched product ""Good Luck,"" never gained mainstream traction, Skoal Bandits captured significant market share after its 1983 introduction. Internal market research found that smokers generally used Skoal Bandits in smokefree environments, yet continued to smoke cigarettes in other contexts. Over time, pouch products increasingly featured increased flavor, size, nicotine strength and user imagery variation. CONCLUSIONS: Marlboro and Camel Snus advertising mirrors historical advertising for Skoal Bandits, designed to recruit new users and smokers subjected to smokefree places. Despite serious efforts, pouched MST marketing has been unable to dispel its association with traditional smokeless tobacco stereotypes as macho and rural. Public education efforts to discourage new users and dual use of MST and cigarettes should emphasize that ""new"" pouch products are simply repackaging ""old"" smokeless tobacco.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

They are manufactured by large tobacco companies and entice tobacco or nicotine addicts, although the products are presented as a 'harmless choice.' Nevertheless, dentists and oral health specialists worry about oral mucosal changes due to product interactions with the oral mucosa. Unfortunately, there are no case reports of oral mucosal changes from nicotine pouches that are also investigated histopathologically. The aim of the present study was to visually and histopathologically investigate oral mucosal changes in nicotine pouch users. An online retrospective survey regarding medical and dental health, dietary habits, and tobacco consumption habits was conducted (n = 50). Respondents were selected for further intraoral and histopathological investigation based on the inclusion criteria. All five respondents had oral lesions that were histopathologically analyzed. Visually, the lesions varied in form and intensity, but all appeared white at the location where the pouches were placed. Histopathological analyses revealed parakeratosis with acanthotic epithelium, intraepithelial and connective tissue oedema, and chronic inflammatory infiltration with lymphocytes and macrophages. Participants received information about nicotine cessation and oral health recommendations. In conclusion, nicotine pouches significantly impacted oral mucosa with white lesions that revealed important changes at the cellular level.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Efforts have been made to reduce smoking prevalence and promote cessation, but challenges, such as nicotine addiction, marketing tactics by tobacco industry, and cultural acceptability hinder progress. Technology has emerged as a potential tool to address these challenges by providing innovative scalable interventions. The objective of the study was to analyze and map scientific literature on technology-based intervention for tobacco prevention and treatment. METHODS: A bibliometric methodology was conducted. Scopus database was used to retrieve relevant research articles published between 2003 and 2022. The analysis included publication trends, key contributors, research hotspots, research themes, the most impactful articles, and emerging research topics. RESULTS: A total of 639 articles were found, with a slow and fluctuating growth pattern observed after 2011. The Journal of Medical Internet Research was the most prominent journal in the field. The United States was the leading country in the field, followed up by the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Research hotspots included smoking cessation, randomized controlled trials, and technology-based methods such as internet, mHealth, smartphone apps, text messages, and social media. Four primary research themes were identified: development of smartphone applications, efficacy of text messaging interventions, acceptance and effectiveness of smartphone applications, and interventions targeting young adults and students using mobile phone and social media platforms. The top 10 cited articles demonstrated effectiveness of digital interventions in promoting smoking cessation rates and reducing relapse rates. Emerging research topics included the use of virtual reality interventions, interventions for specific populations through personalized tools, and technology-based interventions in non-Western countries. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study highlight the potential of technology to address the challenges associated with tobacco smoking. Further future research in this area is warranted to continue advancing the field and developing effective and evidence-based interventions to combat tobacco smoking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This is also intended as an advocacy tool to widely include health care professionals in the fight for tobacco control and prevention of tobacco related adverse health effects. This article expands on the evidence outlined in the TKS, providing a more comprehensive and clinically focused analysis, aimed at lung-specialist audience. It emphasizes six key messages aimed at guiding healthcare providers and governments in advocating for the health of people living with asthma and the broader population: (1) Babies born to mothers who smoke have smaller lungs and an increased risk of developing asthma during childhood. Pregnant women should receive targeted support to quit tobacco use. (2) Children exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke have an increased risk of developing asthma. (3) Smoking during adolescence and adulthood increases the risk of developing asthma and exacerbates the condition, as well as causing other lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. (4) For people living with asthma, smoking worsens symptoms and can make treatment with medications less effective. All smokers with asthma should be supported to quit smoking. (5) E-cigarettes, heated tobacco products and other nicotine-delivery devices likely also carry risks. Governments should implement effective tobacco control measures to protect all individuals, including those who are vulnerable. (6) The tobacco and nicotine industries' aggressive tactics in the marketing of their products specifically target children, adolescents and young adults. Protecting youth from these harmful tactics is a top priority.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

Clinical trial data suggest vaporized nicotine products (VNPs) aid smoking cessation. Most VNP trials have used refillable tank systems, but newer generation (pod) devices now comprise the largest market share yet have limited clinical trial evidence on safety and effectiveness. This study evaluates the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of VNPs (pod and tank device) compared with nicotine replacement therapy ([NRT]-gum or lozenge) for smoking cessation. METHODS: This is a two-arm, open-label, superiority, parallel group, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment. The RCT is conducted at the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. Participants are people who smoke daily, are interested in quitting and receive a government pension or allowance (N = 1058). Participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive 8 weeks of free: VNPs, with pod (40 mg/mL nicotine salt) and tank device (18 mg/mL freebase nicotine) in mixed flavours; or NRT (gum or lozenge; 4 mg). All participants will receive daily text message behavioural support for 5 weeks. Assessments will be undertaken by telephone at baseline, with three follow-up calls (two check-in calls within the first month and final follow-up at 7 months post randomization) to ascertain smoking status, treatment adherence and adverse events. The primary outcome is 6-month continuous abstinence verified by carbon monoxide breath test of ≤5ppm at 7-month follow-up. Safety and cost-effectiveness of VNPs versus NRT will also be evaluated. DISCUSSION: Further data are required to strengthen certainty of evidence for VNPs aiding smoking cessation, particularly for newer generation pod devices. To our knowledge, this trial is the first to offer choice of VNPs and no comparative effectiveness trial data exists for new pod devices. If effective, the findings can inform wider implementation of VNPs to aid smoking cessation in a priority group.

We report here the development of methods for the analysis of STPs for coumarin and for α-angelica lactone (α-AL), both of which have been included in various published lists of tobacco toxicants. We have also determined the concentrations of these lactones in commercial STPs from the US and Sweden, representing 80-90% of the 2010 market share for all the major STP categories in these two countries: 65 products (plus two reference products) for coumarin and 66 commercial products for α-AL. For coumarin, methanol extracts of the STPs were analysed by HPLC/MS/MS. The lower limit of quantification (LOQ) and limit of detection (LOD) were, respectively, 100 and 30 ng coumarin/g of STP on a wet weight basis (WWB). Alpha-AL was determined via direct headspace GC/MS. The LOQ and LOD were 65 and 30 ng/g WWB respectively. Coumarin was detected In 3/33 Swedish snus, 5/13 US chewing tobaccos, 16/16 moist snuffs and 5/6 dry snuffs. Concentrations in those samples with quantifiable coumarin contents ranged from 186 to 1656 ng/g WWB. Concentrations of coumarin measured in this study were consistent with levels naturally found in tobacco. None of the STPs analysed would significantly contribute to coumarin exposure in consumers compared with dietary sources, and estimated exposure levels were 1000× lower than the European Food Safety Authority Tolerable Daily Intake. Hence the relevance of coumarin to the toxicity of STPs and its inclusion in the FDA's list of harmful and potentially harmful compounds list is questionable. Measurements of α-AL in these STPs found that the majority did not have quantifiable contents, however, for three STPs concentrations of α-AL were above the LOQ (116-140 ng/g WWB) and for four other STPs concentrations of α-AL could be estimated between the LOD and LOQ. Beta-angelica lactone was tentatively identified in three of the STPs but the levels could not be reliably quantified. The levels of α-AL in tobacco products are reported here for the first time, but the relevance of α-AL to the toxicity of STPs is also highly questionable given that it has GRAS status as a permitted food additive.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Yes,Yes,['British American Tobacco'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Various styles of STPs were examined: loose and portion snus from Sweden, and chewing tobacco, dry snuff, moist snuff, hard pellet, soft pellet and plug from the US. The components analysed were major STP components such as water, nicotine, sugars, humectants, sodium ions, chloride ions and ash. The relative quantities of the components varied significantly between different styles of STP. The major component of moist snuff and Swedish loose snus is water. With Swedish portion snus water and pouch material comprise more than half of the product mass; with chewing tobaccos water and sugars comprise around 60% of the products. With these STPs, tobacco was a minor component (30-35%) of the product mass. By way of contrast, tobacco comprised the majority (around 70-90%) of the product mass with dry snuff, hard pellet and soft pellet products. Additives such as sugars, propylene glycol, glycerol, and sodium chloride comprised up to around 12% of the STPs, except for plug and chewing tobaccos where sugars comprised 15-30% by mass of the STP on average. Significant disagreements were found amongst alternative methods of determining water/moisture content for STPs. In particular the oven method, commonly used to determine moisture in tobacco, gave significantly higher values than the Karl Fischer water method when propylene glycol was present. Smaller but similar differences were found using the Near-Infrared method. Choice of measurement technique has important consequences for accuracy of toxicant levels when reporting on a dry-weight basis, a commonly used parameter in smokeless tobacco research and emerging regulatory standards. Conversion to a DWB was also found to produce a preferential bias between and within different STP categories in favour of drier products. These data provide greater understanding of differences in the compositions of contemporary smokeless tobacco products, and demonstrate challenges associated with conversion of actual product contents to dry weight basis values.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

As the anti-smoking movement continued to grow since the 1950s, and consumers become more aware of their health and environmental protection, the world tobacco industry has been committed to research, develop and produce low nicotine cigarette products with relatively low risk to human health. Among various approaches, the use of microorganisms to reduce nicotine content and improve tobacco quality has become one of the most promising methods. Due to increasing interest in nicotine-degrading microorganisms (NDMs), this article reviews recent reports on NDMs, nicotine-degrading enzymes, regulation of nicotine-degrading bacterial consortia and optimization of fermentation conditions, aiming to provide updated references for the in-depth research and application of microorganisms for the degradation of nicotine.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

It affects thousands of farm workers worldwide. Brazil is the second tobacco producer in the world; despite this, there are few studies on GTS among Brazilian harvesters. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of GTS among a population of tobacco workers from a producing area in northeastern Brazil and investigate whether the occurrence of the disease was influenced by factors such age, gender and smoking status. In addition, it was investigated if there was association between the onset of GTS and genetic polymorphisms in genes that encode some detoxification enzymes. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect demographic, behavioral and occupational data from the referred workers. Polymorphisms were tested through the Polymerase Chain Reaction technique. RESULTS: The total prevalence of GTS found was 56.9%, with a significant difference between genders (71.7% for women and 35.3% for men, p < 0.0001). No association was identified between the investigated polymorphisms and GTS. This study confirms the occurrence of GTS among tobacco harvesters in Brazil with high prevalence. The investigation suggests the need to take preventive measures to protect tobacco workers against this disease.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Epigenetic aging may explain the relationship between smoking, electronic cigarette vaping, and pulmonary health. No study has examined smoking and vaping-related epigenetic aging in relation to lung biomarkers. METHODS: Lung epigenetic aging measured by DNA methylation (mAge) and its acceleration (mAA) was assessed in young (age 21-30) electronic cigarette vapers (EC, n = 14, including 3 never-smoking EC), smokers (SM, n = 16), and non-EC/non-SM (NS, n = 39). We investigated relationships of mAge estimates with chronological age (Horvath-mAge), lifespan/mortality (Grim-mAge), telomere length (TL-mAge), smoking/EC history, urinary biomarkers, lung cytokines, and transcriptome. RESULTS: Compared to NS, EC and SM had significantly older Grim-mAge, shorter TL-mAge, significantly accelerated Grim-mAge and decelerated TL-mAge. Among SM, Grim-mAA was associated with nicotine intake and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL). For EC, Horvath-mAA was significantly correlated with puffs per day. Overall, cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8) and 759 transcripts (651 unique genes) were significantly associated with Grim-mAA. Grim-mAA-associated genes were highly enriched in immune-related pathways and genes that play a role in the morphology and structures of cells/tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Faster lung mAge for SM is consistent with prior studies of blood. Faster lung mAge for EC compared to NS indicates possible adverse pulmonary effects of EC on biological aging. Our findings support further research, particularly on epigenetic markers, on effects of smoking and vaping on pulmonary health. Given that most EC are former smokers, further study is needed to understand unique effects of electronic cigarettes on biological aging.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,Yes,

Smoking cessation can increase life expectancy by nearly a decade if achieved in the third or fourth decades of life. Various stop smoking interventions are available including pharmacotherapies, electronic cigarettes, behavioural support, and alternative therapies. This protocol outlines an evidence review which will evaluate the benefits and harms of stop smoking interventions in adults. METHODS: The evidence review will consist of two stages. First, an overview of systematic reviews evaluating the benefits and harms of various stop smoking interventions delivered in or referred from the primary care setting will be conducted. The second stage will involve updating a systematic review on electronic cigarettes identified in the overview; randomized controlled trials will be considered for outcomes relating to benefits while randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and comparative observational studies will be considered for evaluating harms. Search strategies will be developed and peer-reviewed by medical information specialists. The search strategy for the updated review on e-cigarettes will be developed using that of the candidate systematic review. The MEDLINE®, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library electronic databases will be searched as of 2008 for the overview of reviews and from the last search date of the selected review for the updated review. Organizational websites and trial registries will be searched for unpublished or ongoing reviews/studies. Two reviewers will independently screen the title and abstracts of citations using the liberal accelerated method. Full-text screening will be performed independently by two reviewers. Extracted data will be verified by a second reviewer. Disagreements regarding full-text screening and data extraction will be resolved by consensus or third-party adjudication. The methodological quality of systematic reviews, risk of bias of randomized and non-randomized trials, and methodological quality of cohort studies will be evaluated using AMSTAR 2, the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and a modified version of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network critical appraisal tool, respectively.

It is the most widely grown non-food crop in the world. Tobacco use is widespread due to its addictive nature of its main constituent nicotine. Therefore, the knowledge of nicotine level in tobacco is important to tobacco industry and in the area of toxicology to control its harmful effect on health. There is no report in the literature on nicotine level of Ethiopian raw (unprocessed) tobacco leaves. Hence, the objective of this study is to determine the levels of nicotine in the Ethiopian tobacco leaves. Samples were collected based on their leaves positions, species and place of cultivation from different regions of Ethiopia. These were Virginia type tobacco from Shewa Robit and Billate, Burley and Oriental types of tobacco from Awassa and native tobacco used as pipe smoking (Gaya) from Wollayita. The level of nicotine in four different varieties of Ethiopian tobacco leaves was determined using high performance liquid chromatography. The level of nicotine in the four different varieties of Ethiopian tobacco were Virginia tobacco (3.26 %), the native tobacco 'Gaya' (1.10 %), Burley tobacco (0.650 %), and Oriental tobacco leaves (≤0.0500 %). It was found that the nicotine level of Ethiopian Virginia tobacco leaves increases from bottom to top leaf (stalk) positions of the tobacco plant. It was also found that the nicotine level of Ethiopian tobacco leaves varies in different species and the nicotine level of the same tobacco species differ in different area of cultivation. In general, the level of nicotine in Ethiopian tobacco is comparable with that in the rest of the world.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

RESULTS: Five main themes were identified: health knowledge, availability of and accessibility to NNDD products, cost, social acceptance, and NNDD use experience. There was curiosity and interest in the uptake and use of NNDDs, but the absence of centralised product information was identified as a barrier. Other themes were related to the design and functionality of the NNDD products. For example, the e-cigarette with its low maintenance was seen as easier to use than the heated tobacco product, which offered too short a single use duration and was described as 'cumbersome'. Throat discomfort and high anticipated cost were among additional barriers identified for both product types. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need for reliable objective information on the health effects of NNDDs compared with combustible cigarettes, which could facilitate their regular use. Product adjustment such as single use duration alignment with combustible cigarette smoking duration may encourage uptake. Interventions offering opportunity for experience of NNDD use and knowledge dissemination of NNDDs could increase motivation to adopt harm reducing behaviours as demonstrated in this study.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, nicotine-degrading bacteria (NDB) and their function in tobacco planting soil are not fully understood. First, 52 NDB strains belonging to seven genera were isolated from tobacco soil. The most dominant genera were Flavobacterium (36.5%), Pseudomonas (30.8%), and Arthrobacter (15.4%), and Chitinophaga and Flavobacterium have not been previously reported. Then, two efficient NDB strains, Arthrobacter nitrophenolicus ND6 and Stenotrophomonas geniculata ND16, were screened and inoculated in the compost fertilizer from tobacco waste. The nicotine concentrations were reduced from 1.5 mg/g (DW) to below the safety threshold of 0.5 mg/g. Furthermore, strain ND6 followed the pyridine pathway of nicotine degradation, but the degrading pathway in strain ND16 could not be determined according to genomic analysis and color change. Finally, the abundance of nicotine-degrading genes in tobacco rhizosphere soil was investigated via metagenomic analysis. Five key genes, ndhA, nctB, kdhL, nboR, and dhponh, represent the whole process of nicotine degradation, and their abundance positively correlated with soil nicotine concentrations (p < 0.05). In conclusion, various NDB including unknown species live in tobacco soil and degrade nicotine efficiently. Some key nicotine-degrading genes could be used in monitoring nicotine degradation in the environment. The fermentation of compost from tobacco waste is a promising application of efficient NDB.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This substitution often occurs without physician oversight, raising patient safety concerns. We aimed to characterize substitution and doctor-patient communication patterns in Canada, where there is a mature market and national regulatory system for medical cannabis. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional online survey in May 2021 for seven days with adult Canadian federally-authorized medical cannabis patients (N = 2697) registered with two global cannabis companies to evaluate patient perceptions of Primary Care Provider (PCP) knowledge of medical cannabis and communication regarding medical cannabis with PCPs, including PCP authorization of licensure and substitution of cannabis for other medications. RESULTS: Most participants (62.7%, n = 1390) obtained medical cannabis authorization from their PCP. Of those who spoke with their PCP about medical cannabis (82.2%, n = 2217), 38.6% (n = 857) reported that their PCP had ""very good"" or ""excellent"" knowledge of medical cannabis and, on average, were moderately confident in their PCP's ability to integrate medical cannabis into treatment. Participants generally reported higher ratings for secondary care providers, with 82.8% (n = 808) of participants rating their secondary care provider's knowledge about medical cannabis as ""very good"" or ""excellent."" Overall, 47.1% (n = 1269) of participants reported substituting cannabis for pharmaceuticals or other substances (e.g., alcohol, tobacco/nicotine). Of these, 31.3% (n = 397) reported a delay in informing their PCP of up to 6 months or more, and 34.8% (n = 441) reported that their PCP was still not aware of their substitution. Older, female participants had higher odds of disclosing cannabis substitution to their PCPs. CONCLUSION: Most of the surveyed Canadian medical cannabis patients considered their PCPs knowledgeable about cannabis and were confident in their PCPs' ability to integrate cannabis into treatment plans. However, many surveyed patients substituted cannabis for other medications without consulting their PCPs. These results suggest a lack of integration between mainstream healthcare and medical cannabis that may be improved through physician education and clinical experience.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

AIMS: To examine the relationship between vitamin concentrations, ADHD diagnosis and psychiatric symptoms in young adult ADHD patients and controls. METHOD: Eight vitamins and the nicotine metabolite cotinine were analysed in serum samples from 133 ADHD patients and 131 controls aged between 18 and 40, who also reported ADHD symptoms and comorbid conditions. RESULTS: Lower concentrations of vitamins B2, B6 and B9 were associated with the ADHD diagnosis, and B2 and B6 also with symptom severity. Smokers had lower levels of vitamins B2 and B9. CONCLUSIONS: ADHD patients were overrepresented in the group with low levels of some vitamins, possibly indicative of inadequate dietary intake of these micronutrients in a subgroup of patients. It is important to identify these patients in dietary intervention trials of ADHD.

American Society of Clinical Oncology.,"INTRODUCTION: The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) supports the elimination of tobacco products. Toward that goal, ASCO urges the adoption of national policy that strengthens regulation of the sale, promotion, and distribution of such products. To reduce cancer mortality, our regulatory policies must recognize that the nicotine within tobacco is an addictive substance, the use of which leads to 30% of all cancer deaths and a total of 419,000 deaths each year. RESTRICTING ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION: Tobacco-related advertising and promotion should be banned. At a minimum, national policies should: ban billboards; limit advertising to black and white text only; prohibit the sale or giveaway of products that contain tobacco brand names or logos; prohibit brand name sponsorship of sporting or entertainment events; and require stronger and more prominent warning labels on all tobacco products. RESTRICTING ACCESS BY CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS: Despite existing state laws prohibiting sale of tobacco products to minors, children are able to buy such products easily. National regulation of the sale and distribution of tobacco products is necessary to eliminate children's access to tobacco. Where sales are permitted, they should be limited to face-to-face purchases by individuals 18 and older. Vending machines and other means of distributing tobacco without a face-to-face purchase should be outlawed. ENHANCING PUBLIC EDUCATION: To the extent tobacco sales are allowed to continue, the federal government should mandate that the tobacco industry contribute substantial funds for a national public education campaign to prevent young people from smoking and other tobacco use. RAISING TOBACCO EXCISE TAXES: ASCO has long advocated a substantial increase (in the range of $2) in the federal excise tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products- a measure known to decrease consumption, particularly among children. Revenue from a tax on tobacco products should be used to support retraining for tobacco farmers, biomedical research, health care delivery, and antitobacco education. CONTROLLING TOBACCO EXPORTS: United State trade policies should discourage the export of tobacco products and manufacturing to foreign markets. At a minimum, United States tobacco companies selling or manufacturing tobacco products in foreign markets that have not developed comparable health warning labels should be required to retain United States warning labels. TAKING RESPONSIBILITY AS HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS: Physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals-especially those in primary care disciplines-have the opportunity and responsibility to assist patients' efforts to quit tobacco use and to ensure that nonsmokers continue to avoid the addiction. Oncology specialists should discuss the causal relationship between tobacco use and cancer as well as a variety of other chronic diseases and assist, as required, the patient and family members to end tobacco dependency. In addition, health care professionals must advocate that public and private insurers be required to provide health care coverage for medically necessary interventions, such as counseling and nicotine transdermal systems.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

In contrast, the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), specifically e-cigarettes, has grown to alarming rates and threatens to hinder progress against tobacco use. A major concern is ENDS use by youth and adults who never previously used tobacco. While ENDS emit fewer carcinogens than combustible tobacco, preliminary evidence links ENDS use to DNA damage and inflammation, key steps in cancer development. Furthermore, high levels of nicotine can also increase addiction, raise blood pressure, interfere with brain development, and suppress the immune system. The magnitude of long-term health risks will remain unknown until longitudinal studies are completed. ENDS have been billed as a promising tool for combustible tobacco cessation, but further evidence is needed to assess their potential efficacy for adults who smoke. Of concern, epidemiological studies estimate that approximately 15%-42% of adults who use ENDS have never used another tobacco product, and another 36%-54% dual use both ENDS and combustible tobacco. This policy statement details advances in science related to ENDS and calls for urgent action to end predatory practices of the tobacco industry and protect public health. Importantly, we call for an immediate ban on all non-tobacco-flavored ENDS products that contain natural or synthetic nicotine to reduce ENDS use by youth and adults who never previously used tobacco. Concurrently, evidence-based treatments to promote smoking cessation and prevent smoking relapse to reduce cancer incidence and improve public health remain top priorities for our organizations. We also recognize there is an urgent need for research to understand the relationship between ENDS and tobacco-related disparities.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

On the basis of the cultural theory of risk, policy disputants were divided into entrepreneurial, bureaucratic, and egalitarian communities, each with a distinct cosmology that impedes discourse among the groups. The authors examined ways in which the 3 policy factions framed the tobacco advertising issues to see the extent to which such unique cosmologies were expressed or whether mutual frames might signal opportunities for negotiation among the interest groups. Major themes in the testimony were identified through semantic network analysis and clustering of associated words that revealed discourse patterns peculiar to each group and reflective of their cultural biases toward health risk. Semantic network analysis can be a tool to clarify these presuppositions and unmask relations among factions, thereby bridging policy solutions across interest groups.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Skoal Classic Wintergreen (SCW) and CORESTA CRP1.1 pouches were used as test products. The dissolution was performed at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 rpm basket or paddle speed in 500 ml artificial saliva pH 6.8. The products were also characterized for assay, pH, particle size, and loss on drying. The dissolution profiles were evaluated for amount/% of nicotine dissolved, time to reach plateau, and profiles comparison by f2 and f1 factors. The nicotine assay was 13.3 ± 0.2 and 7.6 ± 0.1 mg/pouch for SCW and CRP1.1, respectively. The nicotine dissolved in 30 min from SCW and CRP1.1 were 38.4-81.8 and 37.6-88.1, and 50.5-64.9 and 72.3-92.1% by paddle and basket methods, respectively. The f2 and f1 values were ≤ 39.2 and ≥ 42.1 and ≤ 43.2 and ≥ 34.1 for basket methods and paddle methods. RSD were less than 20% at all points of dissolution profiles, and dissolution plateau were achieved in 30 min at some of the tested conditions. In summary, dissolution methods based on basket and paddle can be used as a performance test for STPs.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Although nicotine is the primary driver of physiological addiction in smoking, isolated and controlled use of nicotine is one of the most effective adjuncts to quitting smoking. OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between nicotine and noncombustion cigarette products on bone growth. METHODS: One thousand five studies were identified, of which 501 studies were excluded, leaving 504 studies available for review. Of note, 52 studies were deemed to be irrelevant. Four hundred fifty-two studies remained for eligibility assessment. Of the remaining 452, 218 failed to assess study outcomes, 169 failed to assess bone biology, 13 assessed 5 patients or fewer, and 12 were deemed to be ineligible of the study criteria. Forty studies remained for inclusion within this systematic review. RESULTS: Of the 40 studies identified for inclusion within the study, 30 studies were classified as ""Animal Basic Science,"" whereas the remaining 10 were categorized as ""Human Basic Science."" Of the 40 studies, 11 noted decreased cell proliferation and boney growth, whereas 8 showed an increase. Four studies noted an increase in gene expression products, whereas 11 noted a significant decrease. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that nicotine has a variety of complex interactions on osteoblast and osteoclastic activities. Nicotine demonstrates dose-dependent effects on osteoblast proliferation, boney growth, and gene expression. Further study is warranted to extrapolate the effects of solitary nicotine on clinical outcomes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Different forms of smokeless tobacco are currently massively promoted and are gaining in importance. Dry nasal snuff--the oldest known form of tobacco in Europe--is one of them. The health risks associated with it are different to those attributed to smoking and oral wet snuff. The nicotine contained leads to dependency. Its resorption rate is similar to that of smoking, so it could be seen as an adequate substitutional therapy. The risk for cardiovascular diseases is lower, compared to that for smokers. Chronic abuse leads to morphological and functional changes in the nasal mucosa. Although it contains substances that are potentially carcinogenic, at present, there is no firm evidence, relating the use of nasal snuff to a higher incidence of head and neck or other malignancies.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

However, several studies have shown that vaping predicts smoking initiation and might provide a gateway into smoking for those who otherwise would never have smoked. This paper considers various aspects of the gateway issue in youths. Methods: Here, we reviewed studies (N=15) of the gateway effect examining how extensively they accounted for confounders associated with smoking initiation in youths. We estimated how omitting a confounder, or misclassifying it, might bias the association between vaping and smoking initiation. We assessed how smoking prevalence might be affected by any true gateway effect, and examined trends in youth smoking and e-cigarette use from national surveys. Results: The list of smoking predictors adjusted for in studies reporting a significant gateway effect is not comprehensive, rarely considering internalising/externalising disorders, outcome expectancies, school performance, anxiety, parental smoking and peer attitudes. Furthermore, no study adjusted for residual confounding from inaccurately measured predictors. Better adjustment may substantially reduce the estimated gateway effect. Calculations showed that as any true gateway effects increase, there are much smaller increases in smoking prevalence, and that gateway effects increase only if initiating vaping is more frequent than initiating smoking. These effects on prevalence also depend on the relative odds of quitting vs. initiation. Data from five surveys in US/UK youths all show that, regardless of sex and age, smoking prevalence in 2014-2016 declined faster than predicted by the preceding trend, suggesting the absence of a substantial gateway effect. We also present arguments suggesting that even with some true gateway effect, introducing e-cigarettes likely reduces SRD risk. Conclusions: A true gateway effect in youths has not yet been demonstrated. Even if it were, e-cigarette introduction may well have had a beneficial population health impact.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Philip Morris International'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

A recent review of e-cigarettes agreed there was substantial evidence for this ""gateway effect"". However, the number of confounders considered in the studies was limited, so we investigated whether the effect might have resulted from inadequate adjustment, using Waves 1 and 2 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study. METHODS: Our main analyses considered Wave 1 never cigarette smokers who, at Wave 2, had information available on smoking initiation. We constructed a propensity score for ever e-cigarette use from Wave 1 variables, using this to predict ever cigarette smoking. Sensitivity analyses accounted for use of other tobacco products, linked current e-cigarette use to subsequent current smoking, or used propensity scores for ever smoking or ever tobacco product use as predictors. We also considered predictors using data from both waves to attempt to control for residual confounding from misclassified responses. RESULTS: Adjustment for propensity dramatically reduced the unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 5.70 (4.33-7.50) to 2.48 (1.85-3.31), 2.47 (1.79-3.42) or 1.85 (1.35-2.53), whether adjustment was made as quintiles, as a continuous variable or for the individual variables. Additional adjustment for other tobacco products reduced this last OR to 1.59 (1.14-2.20). Sensitivity analyses confirmed adjustment removed most of the gateway effect. Control for residual confounding also reduced the association. CONCLUSIONS: We found that confounding is a major factor, explaining most of the observed gateway effect. However, our analyses are limited by small numbers of new smokers considered and the possibility of over-adjustment if taking up e-cigarettes affects some predictor variables. Further analyses are intended using Wave 3 data which should avoid these problems.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We addressed this using data from the nationally representative PATH study, with detailed accounting for potential confounding variables. Methods: We considered adults aged 25+. Our original analyses, reported in version 1 of this paper, used data for Waves 1 to 3, separate analyses considering Waves 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and 1 to 3. These related baseline ever e-cigarette use (or e-product use at Wave 2) to quitting at follow-up, adjusting for confounders derived from 55 candidates. Sensitivity analyses omitted ever other product users, linked quitting to current e-cigarette use, and used values of some predictors modified using follow-up data. Additional analyses used data for Waves 1 to 4, separately considering sustained, delayed and temporary quitting during Waves 1 to 3, 2 to 4 and 1 to 4. Sensitivity analyses considered 30-day quitting, restricted attention to smokers attempting to quit, and considered ever smokeless tobacco or snus use. Results: In the original analyses, unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) of quitting smoking for ever e-cigarette use were 1.29 (95% CI 1.01-1.66), 1.52 (1.26-1.83) and 1.47 (1.19-1.82) for the Wave 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 1 to 3 analyses. These reduced after adjustment, to 1.23 (0.94-1.61), 1.51 (1.24-1.85) and 1.39 (1.11-1.74). Quitting rates remained elevated in users in all sensitivity analyses. The additional analyses found associations of e-cigarette use with sustained, delayed and temporary quitting, associations little affected by considering 30-day quitting, and only slightly reduced restricting attention to quit attempters. Ever use of smokeless tobacco or snus also predicted increased quitting. Conclusions: As does most evidence from clinical trials, other analyses of PATH, and other epidemiological studies, our results suggest using e-cigarettes helps adult smokers to quit.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

This paper describes the nationwide prevalence and patterns of TNP use in Japan following the commercialization of one such smoke-free TNP, the heated tobacco product IQOS® (Philip Morris International). Methods: We analyzed the first annual data (2016-2017) of two repeated cross-sectional surveys conducted in a representative sample of the Japanese general adult (≥20 years of age) population (N = 4,878) and a sample of adult IQOS users (N = 2,000). We assessed the prevalence of current TNP use according to type of product (cigarettes, IQOS, e-cigarettes, and other TNPs) in the general population and patterns of TNP use in the IQOS user sample. Results: The prevalence of current use across all TNP in the sampled general population was 18.5% (95% confidence interval 17.2-19.5%), with 17.5% (16.4-18.6%) for cigarette smoking and 1.8% (1.4-2.2%) for IQOS use. Regarding the distribution of patterns of use in the IQOS user survey, the majority (63.4% [61.2-65.6%]) were exclusive users of IQOS, followed by 20.6% (18.7-22.5%) of individuals who reported dual use of IQOS and cigarettes. Conclusions: In Japan, cigarette smoking remains the most prevalent way of consuming TNP; however, IQOS is being adopted by a growing number of adult Japanese smokers. These findings serve as baseline data for monitoring trends over time in the use and adoption of potential smoke-free TNP in Japan.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Philip Morris International'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

From the end of 2020 until at least 2024 the STS/ATS is expanding to Scotland and Wales to include all constituent nations in Great Britain. Expanding data collection to Scotland and Wales will permit the evaluation of how smoking and alcohol related behaviours respond to divergent policy scenarios across the devolved nations. Methods The STS/ATS consists of monthly cross-sectional household interviews (computer or telephone assisted) of representative samples of adults in Great Britain aged 16+ years. Commencing in October 2020 each month a new sample of approximately 1700 adults in England, 450 adults in Scotland and 300 adults in Wales complete the survey (~n = 29,400 per year). The expansion of the survey to Scotland and Wales has been funded for the collection of at least 48 waves of data across four years. The data collected cover a broad range of smoking and alcohol-related parameters (including but not limited to smoking status, cigarette/nicotine dependence, route to quit smoking, prevalence and frequency of hazardous drinking, attempts and motivation to reduce alcohol consumption, help sought and motives for attempts to reduce alcohol intake) and socio-demographic characteristics (including but not limited to age, gender, region, socio-economic position) and will be reviewed monthly and refined in response to evolving policy needs and public interests.

In an attempt to reduce these, support is growing for the use of alternative nicotine delivery systems in smokers who are unable to break their addiction to nicotine. However, as increasing numbers of alternative nicotine delivery systems are developed, by pharmaceutical companies, the tobacco industry and other manufacturers, the need for a comprehensive regulatory policy governing all such products becomes even more important. This article reviews the existing legislation surrounding tobacco and nicotine, the politics of nicotine delivery, and current scientific knowledge surrounding nicotine, and assesses the various policy options to minimize tobacco-related harm. Segmentation of the nicotine market, according to different smokers' needs, and research and philosophical issues are also considered.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Heated tobacco products - a systematic review.","Heated tobacco products (HTPs) are a form of nicotine delivery intended to provide an alternative to traditional cigarettes. The aim of this systematic review was to present the current state of knowledge on HTPs with an emphasis on the potential impact of HTP use on human health. During the preparation of this systematic review, the literature on HTPs available within Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar was retrieved and examined. In the final review, 97 research papers were included. The authors specifically assessed the construction and operation of HTPs, as well as the chemical composition of HTP tobacco sticks and the generated aerosol, based on evidence from experimental animal and cellular studies, and human-based studies.Heated tobacco products were found to generate lower concentrations of chemical compounds compared to traditional cigarettes, except for water, propylene glycol, glycerol, and acetol. The nicotine levels delivered to the aerosol by HTPs were 70-80% as those of conventional combustion. The results of in vitro and in vivo assessments of HTP aerosols revealed reduced toxicity, but these were mainly based on studies sponsored by the tobacco industry. Independent human-based studies indicated that there was a potentially harmful impact of the active and passive HTP smoking on human health. Currently, a large body of knowledge on HTP exposures and health effects is provided by the tobacco industry (52% of identified studies). Based on the available evidence, HTPs produce lower levels of toxic chemicals, compared to conventional cigarettes, but they are still not risk-free.

However, in Poland there is no specific legislation governing the sale of these products. At the same time, no information has been made public about the hazards e-cigarettes pose to the users and bystanders - passive smokers. The aim of the study was to determine the qualitative composition of the analyzed liquid, which is an essential element of regulating the distribution of such cigarettes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Under this study the method for determining the composition of e-cigarette liquids was developed. This method employs gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Levels of nicotine and flavoring components were determined in 50 e-liquid samples. The results were compared with the information provided by the manufacturer on the packaging. RESULTS: The applied method of qualitative determination helped to identify the main ingredients, such as nicotine and propylene glycol (PG). Propylene glycol was found to be present in all liquids, because it was used as the solvent for nicotine and flavors. There was a good agreement between the declared and the determined content of nicotine in the analyzed samples. The agreement was considerably poorer for the remaining e-liquid ingredients, mainly flavors. CONCLUSIONS: There was no agreement between the flavor substances specified by the manufacturer and aroma identified in the e-cigarette liquid, which may pose a risk to users of e-cigarettes, particularly those susceptible to allergies. Several unsaturated aliphatic alcohols and aldehydes found to be present in the liquids, unstable at elevated temperatures, may be more harmful to the smoker than the original compounds. Therefore, it is essential to implement in Poland the legal provisions regarding e-cigarettes.

Nicotine dependence (ND) or nicotine addiction (NA), among other forms of drug addiction, continues to be a significant public health problem in the world, as it is associated with major severe diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Evidence for a genetic influence on smoking behavior and ND has prompted a search for susceptibility genes. Proof has recently accumulated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genetic region encoding the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits α5, α3, and β4 are associated with smoking and ND. In this review, we consider tobacco as the archetype of substance addiction and describe the evolution of the tobacco habit from elite users to lower socioeconomic abusers (by mass marketing and specific targeting of vulnerable groups by the tobacco industry) to exemplify detrimental behavior with major threats to public health. Finally, we discuss the reasons for the difficulty of quitting addictions/habits and highlight possible solutions.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

The objective of this study was to determine whether perceived accessibility predicted future smoking among youths. METHODS: This study used data from the second Development and Assessment of Nicotine Dependence in Youth (DANDY-2) study, a 4-year (2002-2006) cohort study that began with 1,246 sixth-grade students in 6 Massachusetts communities. DANDY-2 comprised 11 waves of in-person interviews. A total of 1,195 students who were aged 11 to 14 years at the baseline interview in 2002 were eligible for inclusion in this report. The outcomes for this study were the onset of smoking initiation and regular tobacco use. RESULTS: At baseline 1,027 students had never smoked cigarettes, and 168 had previously initiated smoking. During the 4 years of the study, 177 students newly initiated smoking, and 109 became regular smokers. In unadjusted city-stratified Cox proportional hazard models, perceived accessibility increased the risk for smoking initiation among nonsmokers and regular smoking among all participants in a dose-response fashion. Perceived accessibility also increased the risk for smoking progression among initiators in a dose-response fashion. The associations between perceived accessibility and smoking were robust to adjustment for peer and parental smoking. Youths with both perceived accessibility and peer-smokers had a higher risk of regular smoking and progression after initiation than either factor alone. These associations were stable to adjustment for potential confounders other than peer smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived accessibility increases the risk for smoking among youths and has a stronger effect among those with peer smokers. There may be a role for identifying this group of youths for targeted interventions in child health care settings. Perceived accessibility should be carefully considered and measured in smoking intervention programs for teens.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, tobacco use by pregnant women receives greater scrutiny because it can also compromise the health of future generations. More men smoke cigarettes than women. Yet the impact of nicotine use by men upon their descendants has not been as widely scrutinized. We exposed male C57BL/6 mice to nicotine (200 μg/mL in drinking water) for 12 wk and bred the mice with drug-naïve females to produce the F1 generation. Male and female F1 mice were bred with drug-naïve partners to produce the F2 generation. We analyzed spontaneous locomotor activity, working memory, attention, and reversal learning in male and female F1 and F2 mice. Both male and female F1 mice derived from the nicotine-exposed males showed significant increases in spontaneous locomotor activity and significant deficits in reversal learning. The male F1 mice also showed significant deficits in attention, brain monoamine content, and dopamine receptor mRNA expression. Examination of the F2 generation showed that male F2 mice derived from paternally nicotine-exposed female F1 mice had significant deficits in reversal learning. Analysis of epigenetic changes in the spermatozoa of the nicotine-exposed male founders (F0) showed significant changes in global DNA methylation and DNA methylation at promoter regions of the dopamine D2 receptor gene. Our findings show that nicotine exposure of male mice produces behavioral changes in multiple generations of descendants. Nicotine-induced changes in spermatozoal DNA methylation are a plausible mechanism for the transgenerational transmission of the phenotypes. These findings underscore the need to enlarge the current focus of research and public policy targeting nicotine exposure of pregnant mothers by a more equitable focus on nicotine exposure of the mother and the father.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

There is substantial evidence of the influence of conventional cigarette promotion on smoking behaviours in Anglophone countries, and the popularity of social networking sites, as well as the lack of marketing regulations on the commercial promotion of electronic cigarettes online, suggest an urgent need to explore this topic further. This scoping review aims to map the existing evidence related to the influence of e-cigarette commercial promotion on social media on positive perceptions of vaping and vaping behaviours in core Anglophone countries. Searches were conducted in CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Embase, Epistemonikos, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Science Citation Index, on the 21st of July 2022. From 1,385 studies, 11 articles were included in the final review, using diverse study designs, including focus groups, content analysis, cross-sectional studies, and experiments. The studies were primarily based in the U.S. and evidenced the association between the commercial promotion of e-cigarettes on social media with positive perceptions of vaping and vaping behaviours, particularly among young people, addressing diverse themes including celebrities' sponsorship, e-liquid appeal (including flavours and nicotine levels), users' engagement with ads, and other marketing strategies. Further, social networking sites commercially promoting e-cigarettes might increase positive attitudes towards vaping and vaping behaviours, particularly among youths. Future research should be conducted in broader settings, incorporate larger and diverse sample sizes, ensure research transparency, cover multiple social networking sites, emphasize ecological validity, and foment longitudinal studies.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Proponents of ""harm reduction"" point to the Swedish experience. Snus seems to be widely used as an alternative to cigarettes in Sweden, say these proponents, contributing to the low overall prevalence of smoking and smoking-related disease. Harm reduction proponents thus argue that the health community should actively inform inveterate cigarette smokers of the benefits of switching to snus. However, critics of harm reduction say that snus has its own risks, that no form of tobacco should ever be promoted, and that Sweden's experience is likely to be specific to that culture and not transferable to other settings. Critics also remain deeply suspicious that the tobacco industry will use snus marketing as a ""gateway"" to promote cigarettes. In the interests of promoting debate, the authors (who are collaborators on a research project on the future of tobacco control) have agreed to outline the strongest arguments for and against promoting Swedish snus as a form of harm reduction.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

To inform the current review of this legislation, this paper aims to explore transnational tobacco company (TTC) interests in SLT and pure nicotine in Europe from the 1970s to the present, comparing them with TTCs' public claims of support for harm reduction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Internal tobacco industry documents (in total 416 documents dating from 1971 to 2009), obtained via searching the online Legacy Tobacco Documents Library, were analysed using a hermeneutic approach. This library comprises documents obtained via litigation in the US and does not include documents from Imperial Tobacco, Japan Tobacco International, or Swedish Match. To help overcome this limitation and provide more recent data, we triangulated our documentary findings with contemporary documentation including TTC investor presentations. The analysis demonstrates that British American Tobacco explored SLT opportunities in Europe from 1971 driven by regulatory threats and health concerns, both likely to impact cigarette sales negatively, and the potential to create a new form of tobacco use among those no longer interested in taking up smoking. Young people were a key target. TTCs did not, however, make SLT investments until 2002, a time when EU cigarette volumes started declining, smoke-free legislation was being introduced, and public health became interested in harm reduction. All TTCs have now invested in snus (and recently in pure nicotine), yet both early and recent snus test markets appear to have failed, and little evidence was found in TTCs' corporate materials that snus is central to their business strategy. CONCLUSIONS: There is clear evidence that BAT's early interest in introducing SLT in Europe was based on the potential for creating an alternative form of tobacco use in light of declining cigarette sales and social restrictions on smoking, with young people a key target. We conclude that by investing in snus, and recently nicotine, TTCs have eliminated competition between cigarettes and lower-risk products, thus helping maintain the current market balance in favour of (highly profitable) cigarettes while ensuring TTCs' long-term future should cigarette sales decline further and profit margins be eroded.

After decades of public denial, the tobacco industry now agrees with public health authorities that nicotine is addictive. In 2000, Philip Morris became the first major tobacco company to admit nicotine's addictiveness. Evolving definitions of addiction have historically affected subsequent policymaking. This article examines how Philip Morris internally conceptualized addiction immediately before and after this announcement. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed previously secret, internal Philip Morris documents made available as a result of litigation against the tobacco industry. We compared these documents to public company statements and found that Philip Morris's move from public denial to public affirmation of nicotine's addictiveness coincided with pressure on the industry from poor public approval ratings, the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), the United States government's filing of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) suit, and the Institute of Medicine's (IoM's) endorsement of potentially reduced risk products. Philip Morris continued to research the causes of addiction through the 2000s in order to create successful potentially reduced exposure products (PREPs). While Philip Morris's public statements reinforce the idea that nicotine's pharmacology principally drives smoking addiction, company scientists framed addiction as the result of interconnected biological, social, psychological, and environmental determinants, with nicotine as but one component. Due to the fragmentary nature of the industry document database, we may have missed relevant information that could have affected our analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Philip Morris's research suggests that tobacco industry activity influences addiction treatment outcomes. Beyond nicotine's pharmacology, the industry's continued aggressive advertising, lobbying, and litigation against effective tobacco control policies promotes various nonpharmacological determinants of addiction. To help tobacco users quit, policy makers should increase attention on the social and environmental dimensions of addiction alongside traditional cessation efforts.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The present study was carried out between 2006 and 2008 at a manufacturing factory in the Toyama Prefecture of Japan and included subjects who voluntarily entered a smoking cessation program. The program included face-to-face counselling followed by weekly contact to provide encouragement over six months using e-mail or inter-office mail. Nicotine patches were available if required. All 151 participants stopped smoking immediately. Over the 24-month study period, self-report showed 49.7% abstained continuously from smoking. The rate of 24-month consecutive abstinence was higher in participants with lower Fagerström Test scores for Nicotine Dependence at baseline than in those with higher scores (63.6% for 0-2 points vs. 46.5% for 3-6 points vs. 43.8% for 7-10 points; chi-square test p = 0.19). A logistic regression model showed a significant linear trend for the association between the score and abstinence status after adjustment for possible confounding factors (p = 0.03). The crude incremental cost for one individual to successfully quit smoking due to the support program was ¥46,379 (i.e., ¥100 = $1.28, £0.83, or €1.03 at foreign exchange rates). The corresponding costs for the three categories of the Fagerström Test score for Nicotine Dependence were ¥31,953, ¥47,450 and ¥64,956, respectively. When a sensitivity analysis was conducted based on the 95% confidence interval of the success rate, the variance in the corresponding costs was ¥25,514-45,034 for 0-2 points, ¥38,344-61,824 for 3-6 points, and ¥45,698-108,260 for 7-10 points. The degree of nicotine dependence may therefore be an important determinant of the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation programs.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

METHODS: This study employed hospital discharge data identifying all adult AMI admissions (ICD-9-CM code 410) between April 1996 and December 2001. Patients were classified as having an SUD if they had alcohol and/or drug (not nicotine) abuse or dependence using a validated ICD-9-CM coding definition. Catheterization and revascularization data were obtained by linkage with a clinically-detailed cardiac registry. Analyses (controlling for comorbidities and disease severity) compared patients with and without SUDs for post-MI catheterization, revascularization, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of 7,876 AMI unique patient admissions, 2.6% had an SUD. In adjusted analyses mortality was significantly higher among those with an SUD (odds ratio (OR) 2.02; 95%CI: 1.10-3.69), while there was a trend toward lower catheterization rates among those with an SUD (OR 0.75; 95%CI: 0.55-1.01). Among the subset of AMI admissions who underwent catheterization, the adjusted hazard ratio for one-year revascularization was 0.85 (95%CI: 0.65-1.11) with an SUD compared to without. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol and drug use disorders are associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality following AMI in adults of all ages, and may also be associated with decreased access to catheterization and revascularization. This higher mortality in the face of poorer access to procedures suggests that these individuals may be under-treated following AMI.

The ratio of 3HC to cotinine (the ""nicotine metabolite ratio"", NMR) is an in vivo marker for the rate of CYP2A6 mediated nicotine metabolism, and total nicotine clearance, and has been associated with differences in numerous smoking behaviors. The clearance of 3HC, which affects the NMR, occurs via renal excretion and metabolism by UGT2B17, and possibly UGT2B10, to 3HC-glucuronide. We investigated whether slower 3HC glucuronidation alters NMR, altering its ability to predict CYP2A6 activity and reducing its clinical utility. METHODS: Plasma NMR, three urinary NMRs, three urinary 3HC glucuronidation phenotypes and total nicotine equivalents were examined in 540 African American smokers. The UGT2B17 gene deletion and UGT2B10*2 were genotyped. RESULTS: The UGT2B17 gene deletion, but not UGT2B10*2 genotype, was associated with slower 3HC glucuronidation (indicated by three 3HC-glucuronidation phenotypes), indicating its role in this glucuronidation pathway. However, neither lower rates of 3HC glucuronidation, nor the presence of a UGT2B17 and UGT2B10 reduced function allele, altered plasma or urinary NMRs or levels of smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in 3HC glucuronidation activity, including these caused by UGT2B17 gene deletions, did not significantly alter NMR and is therefore unlikely to affect the clinical utility of NMR in smoking behavior and cessation studies. This study demonstrates that NMR is not altered by differences in the rate of 3HC glucuronidation, providing further support that NMR is a reliable indicator of CYP2A6 mediated nicotine metabolism.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

In this study which used a series of nationwide cross-sectional surveys in Korea performed from 2005 to 2011, we examined the prevalence of smoking cessation medication use and factors associated with it. METHODS: We analyzed data from the third to fifth waves of Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2011). Prevalence of each smoking cessation method use was calculated for each year, and its secular trend was tested by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among smokers who made quit attempt during the previous year, 15.7% had used smoking cessation medications,15.3% had used NRT, and 0.7% had used prescription medication. There was a significant increasing trend for NRT use (P<0.001) during the study period, but use of prescription medication did not show any increase over time (P = 0.654) Education on smoking prevention and cessation was associated with smoking cessation medications use (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.58-2.75). CONCLUSIONS: While the use of NRT has increased over years through government-sponsored smoking cessation programs, use of prescription drugs remained very low and flat probably due to lack of reimbursement. Education of smokers about effective smoking cessation methods and change in reimbursement policy are suggested to stimulate evidence-based smoking cessation practice.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Some argue that e-cigarettes have great potential to help smokers quit regular cigarettes while others contend they should be banned for lack of safety and efficacy data. This study examined population data from the U.S. METHODS: A U.S. population survey with a national probability sample (N=10,041) was conducted (February 24 to March 8, 2012, before any major paid advertisement of e-cigarettes appeared on television). Survey respondents were asked if they had heard about e-cigarettes, where they had heard about them, whether they had used e-cigarettes or snus, how often they used them, and why they used them. Responses were weighted to represent the entire U.S. population. FINDINGS: A high proportion, 75.4%, reported having heard about e-cigarettes. Television ranked as the number one source of information, followed by ""in-person conversation"" and ""Internet."" About 8.1% had tried e-cigarettes, and 1.4% were current users. These rates were twice those of snus (4.3% and 0.8%, respectively). Among current smokers, 32.2% had tried e-cigarettes, and 6.3% were current users. Over 80% of current e-cigarette users were non-daily users. Women were significantly more likely to have tried e-cigarettes than men. Those who had tried e-cigarettes were more likely than those who tried snus to report their products being safer than regular cigarettes (49.9% vs. 10.8%). Almost half (49.5%) of current smokers were susceptible to using e-cigarettes in the future. CONCLUSIONS: That e-cigarettes have surpassed snus in adoption rate, even before any promotion by major tobacco companies, suggests that the former have tapped into smokers' intuitive preference for potentially harm-reducing products, probably due to the product design. E-cigarette use is likely to increase in the next few years.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We searched for drug metabolizing enzyme and transporter (DMET) gene variation associated with the NMR and prospective abstinence in 2,946 participants of laboratory studies of nicotine metabolism and of clinical trials of smoking cessation therapies. Stage I was a meta-analysis of the association of 507 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 173 DMET genes with the NMR in 449 participants of two laboratory studies. Nominally significant associations were identified in ten genes after adjustment for intragenic SNPs; CYP2A6 and two CYP2A6 SNPs attained experiment-wide significance adjusted for correlated SNPs (CYP2A6 PACT=4.1E-7, rs4803381 PACT=4.5E-5, rs1137115, PACT=1.2E-3). Stage II was mega-regression analyses of 10 DMET SNPs with pretreatment NMR and prospective abstinence in up to 2,497 participants from eight trials. rs4803381 and rs1137115 SNPs were associated with pretreatment NMR at genome-wide significance. In post-hoc analyses of CYP2A6 SNPs, we observed nominally significant association with: abstinence in one pharmacotherapy arm; cigarette consumption among all trial participants; and lung cancer in four case:control studies. CYP2A6 minor alleles were associated with reduced NMR, CPD, and lung cancer risk. We confirmed the major role that CYP2A6 plays in nicotine metabolism, and made novel findings with respect to genome-wide significance and associations with CPD, abstinence and lung cancer risk. Additional multivariate analyses with patient variables and genetic modeling will improve prediction of nicotine metabolism, disease risk and smoking cessation treatment prognosis.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Among the studies that reported significant associations with cessation, the effects were observed in smokers treated with placebo treatment in some studies and conversely in those receiving active pharmacological therapy (bupropion and nicotine replacement therapies) in others. Thus, it remains unclear whether CHRNA5-A3-B4 is a useful marker for optimizing smoking cessation. Using data from 654 Caucasian smokers treated with placebo, nicotine patch or varenicline, we investigated whether CHRNA5-A3-B4 variants were associated with smoking cessation outcomes, and whether there were significant genotype-by-treatment or haplotype-by-treatment interactions. We observed no significant associations between CHRNA5-A3-B4 variants and smoking cessation, despite replicating previous associations with baseline tobacco consumption. At end of treatment the effect size on smoking cessation in the placebo, patch and varenicline groups for rs16969968 [GG vs. GA+AA] was OR = 0.66 (P = 0.23), OR = 1.01 (P = 0.99), and OR = 1.30 (P = 0.36) respectively, of rs588765 [CC vs. CT+TT] was OR = 0.96 (P = 0.90), OR = 0.84 (P = 0.58), and OR = 0.74 (P = 0.29) respectively, and for rs578776 [GG vs. GA+AA] on smoking cessation was OR = 1.02 (P = 0.95), OR = 0.75 (P = 0.35), and OR = 1.20 (P = 0.51) respectively. Furthermore, we observed no associations with cessation using the CHRNA5-A3-B4 haplotype (constructed using rs16969968 and rs588765), nor did we observe any significant genotype-by-treatment interactions, with or without adjusting for the rate of nicotine metabolism (all P>0.05). We also observed no significant genetic associations with 6 month or 12 month smoking abstinence. In conclusion, we found no association between CHRNA5-A3-B4 variants and smoking cessation rates in this clinical trial; however, as expected, significant associations with baseline tobacco consumption were replicated. Our data suggest that CHRNA5-A3-B4 gene variants do not exhibit a robust association with smoking cessation and are unlikely to be useful for clinically optimizing smoking cessation pharmacotherapy for Caucasian smokers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

METHODS: Air flow rate, pressure drop, and aerosol absorbance were measured using two different protocols, first 10 puffs and a modified smoke-out protocol. RESULTS: First 10 puff protocol: The air flow rate required to produce aerosol ranged between brands from 4-21 mL/s. Pressure drop was relatively stable within a brand but ranged between brands from 14-71 mmH2O and was much lower than the earlier classic 3-piece models. Absorbance, a measure of aerosol density, was relatively consistent between puffs, but varied between brands. With the modified smoke-out protocol, most brands were puffed until 300 puffs. The pressure drop was relatively stable for all brands except three. Absorbance of the aerosol decreased as the number of puffs increased. Although there was some uniformity in performance within some brands, there was large variation between brands. The labeled and measured nicotine concentrations were within 10% of each other in only 1 out of 10 brands. CONCLUSIONS: Over 10 puffs, the cartomizers all perform similarly within a brand but varied between brands. In smoke-out trials, most brands lasted at least 300 puffs, and performed similarly within brands with respect to pressure drop and absorbance. For five brands, products purchased at different times performed differently. These data show some improvement in performance during evolution of these products, but nevertheless indicate problems with quality control in manufacture.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The presence of ammonia in the cigarette filler material and smoke is of significance because of the potential role ammonia could have in raising the ""smoke pH."" An increased smoke pH could shift a fraction of total nicotine to free-base nicotine, which is reportedly more rapidly absorbed by the smoker. Methods measuring ammonia in smoke typically employ acid filled impingers to trap the smoke. We developed a fast, reliable method to measure ammonia in mainstream smoke without the use of costly and time consuming impingers to examine differences in ammonia delivery. The method uses both a Cambridge filter pad and a Tedlar bag to capture particulate and vapor phases of the smoke. We quantified ammonia levels in the mainstream smoke of 50 cigarette brands from 5 manufacturers. Ammonia levels ranged from approximately 1μg to 23μg per cigarette for ISO smoking conditions and 38μg to 67μg per cigarette for Canadian intense smoking conditions and statistically significance differences were observed between brands and manufacturers. Our findings suggest that ammonia levels vary by brand and are higher under Canadian intense smoking conditions.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This information may drive smokers to switch to cigarettes with lower chemical quantities, under the misperception that doing so can reduce health risk. We sought to understand past brand-switching behavior and whether learning about specific chemicals in cigarette smoke increases susceptibility to brand switching. METHODS: Participants were US adult smokers surveyed by phone (n = 1,151, probability sample) and online (n = 1,561, convenience sample). Surveys assessed whether smokers had ever switched cigarette brands or styles to reduce health risk and about likelihood of switching if the smoker learned their brand had more of a specific chemical than other cigarettes. Chemicals presented were nicotine, carbon monoxide, lead, formaldehyde, arsenic, and ammonia. RESULTS: Past brand switching to reduce health risk was common among smokers (43% in phone survey, 28% in online survey). Smokers who were female, over 25, and current ""light"" cigarette users were more likely to have switched brands to reduce health risks (all p < .05). Overall, 61-92% of smokers were susceptible to brand switching based on information about particular chemicals. In both samples, lead, formaldehyde, arsenic, and ammonia led to more susceptibility to switch than nicotine (all p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Many US smokers have switched brands or styles to reduce health risks. The majority said they might or would definitely switch brands if they learned their cigarettes had more of a toxic chemical than other brands. Brand switching is a probable unintended consequence of communications that show differences in smoke chemicals between brands.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Previous research has reported an inverse association between combustible cigarette smoking and educational attainment, but little is known about the association for e-cigarettes, especially heat-not-burn tobacco products. Our objective was to analyze the relationship between educational attainment and e-cigarette and heat-not-burn tobacco use. SETTING: An internet survey (randomly sampled research agency panelists) in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7338 respondents aged 18-69 years in 2015 (3632 men and 3706women). PRIMARY MEASURES: Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of educational attainment for current smoking (combustible cigarettes), e-cigarette ever-use, and heat-not-burn ever-use were calculated by multivariable logistic regression models using covariates including socio-demographic factors. Stratified analyses according to smoking status (combustible cigarettes) were additionally performed for e-cigarette ever-use and heat-not-burn tobacco product ever-use. RESULTS: Associations between educational attainment and e-cigarette ever-use or heat-not-burn tobacco ever-use are not straightforward, although these associations are not statistically significant except for one cell. For example, using ""graduate school"" education as a reference category, adjusted ORs for ""high school"" were 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-2.44) for e-cigarettes ever-use and 0.75 (95% CI:0.19-2.97) for heat-not-burn tobacco product ever-use. Among current smokers, compared with ""graduate school"" (reference), those with lower educational attainment showed 0.6 to 0.7 ORs for e-cigarette ever-use: e.g.,""4-year university""(OR = 0.54, 95% CI:0.24-1.24) and ""high school"" (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.30-1.60). Among former smokers, lower education indicated higher ORs for both e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco ever-use. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides baseline information on educational gradients of e-cigarette and heat-not-burn tobacco products, ever-use. As heat-not-burn tobacco products are increasing their market share in Japan, continuous monitoring of these products will be necessary.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

With declining cigarette sales in the western world, tobacco companies have looked to the development of alternative tobacco products. In 2006 snus products were launched in the US. Even though several studies have demonstrated negative health effects, snus is often depicted as harmless. The aim of the present study was to investigate acute vascular effects of snus as measured by arterial stiffness as well as blood pressure and heart rate. METHODS: Two separate randomized double-blind crossover studies with the same study design were pooled for analysis. Twenty-nine healthy snus-users (17 females, 12 males) were included. Snus (Göteborgs Rapé) and tobacco free snus (Onico) were administered in a randomized order at two separate visits. Arterial stiffness, blood pressure and heart rate were measured at baseline as well as every five minutes for 40 minutes during exposure. Following snus removal, measurements continued for 30 minutes post exposure. Arterial stiffness was measured using pulse wave velocity (Vicorder) and pulse wave analysis (Sphygmocor). RESULTS: Compared to placebo, snus significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate, however, only in females (p = 0.004, p = 0.006 and p<0.001 respectively). No changes were seen in arterial stiffness measurements in either gender. CONCLUSION: We observed an increase in blood pressure and heart rate only in females, but not in males due to snus usage as compared to placebo. This novel finding was surprising and needs to be further investigated considering most of the earlier studies have mainly focused on male snus users and the increasing usage of snus among females.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

All participants used tobacco flavor for one week, and either berry or menthol flavor for one week. Results provide strong evidence that flavor affects the topography behaviors of mean puff flow rate and mean puff volume, and there is insufficient evidence to support an influence of flavor on mean puff duration and mean puff interval. There was insufficient evidence, due to the low power associated with the limited number of observation days, to establish a relationship between flavor and cumulative consumption behavior. While the results indicate that an effect may be evident, additional observation days are required to establish significance.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Our goal was to investigate the potential of gemfibrozil, a PPARα agonist, on reducing tobacco smoking in humans. METHODS: This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluating the effects of gemfibrozil (1200 mg/day) on smoking in 27 treatment-seeking smokers. The study had two 2-week phases separated by a washout period of at least 1 week. In each phase and after 1 week on medication, participants underwent a lab session where cue reactivity and forced choice paradigms were conducted. Physiological responses and self-reported craving were monitored during the presentation of smoking and neutral cues. In addition, two types of cigarettes were used in the forced choice paradigms: the Nicotinized cigarettes (Nic) and the Denicotinized cigarettes (Denic). The goal of the forced choice was to calculate the percentage of choice of Nic cigarettes while taking gemfibrozil or placebo. The number of quit days was calculated during the two quit attempts weeks (one while taking gemfibrozil and one while taking placebo) of the study. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between gemfibrozil and placebo groups in the percentage of choice of Nic cigarettes, the cue-reactivity (both physiological and subjective measures), or in the number of days of abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Although preclinical studies with PPAR α agonists showed promising results, this preliminary study did not demonstrate positive effect of gemfibrozil on tobacco use and cessation indices.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Conventional cigarettes have a well-established relationship with adolescent risky behaviors such as alcohol and drug use; however, no studies exist on the association between alcohol consumption and use of e-cigarettes or HNB tobacco products among Korean adolescents. This study evaluated alcohol-related behaviors and drug use in relation to whether a Korean nationally representative adolescent sample had ever used e-cigarettes and HNB tobacco products. METHODS: Data from the 2018 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey were analyzed. The final study sample comprised 60,040 adolescents. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to examine whether the ever having used e-cigarettes and HNB tobacco products was associated with alcohol-related behaviors and drug use. P-values for trends were calculated to examine the dose-response relationship for each variable. RESULTS: Respondents with higher drinking frequency, drinking quantity, alcohol intoxication, alcohol availability, and drug use were more likely to report having used e-cigarettes and HNB tobacco products, thus implying a significant relationship between substance use and novel tobacco product (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that at-risk adolescents who are engaged in other forms of risk-taking behaviors are prone to attract the experimentation with e-cigarettes or HNB tobacco products. Thus, smoking cessation programs related to substance use should be implemented, and there is an urgent need to monitor and regulate these products effectively.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We compared nicotine delivery and subjective effects associated with the use of two classes of e-cigarettes and cigarettes. METHODS: 14 e-cigarette users were instructed to vape their own e-cigarette device every 20 seconds for 10 minutes while blood was drawn at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,12, and 15 minutes after initiating vaping. Users rated withdrawal symptoms and side effects before and after vaping. E-cigarette devices were classified as first-generation (same size as cigarette, no activation button) or advanced (larger than cigarette with an activation button). Separately, 10 cigarette smokers completed a similar protocol. Fisher's Exact Test and two-sided t-tests were used as appropriate to determine differences in outcomes between first-generation e-cigarette users, advanced e-cigarette users, and smokers. RESULTS: Compared to first-generation devices, advanced devices were associated with greater serum nicotine Cmax (ng/ml) (11.5 v. 2.8, p = 0.0231) and greater nicotine boost (ng/ml) (10.8 v. 1.8, p = 0.0177). Overall, e-cigarettes users experienced a significant reduction in withdrawal and craving, although there were no significant differences between users of first-generation and advanced devices. Comparing e-cigarettes overall to cigarettes, cigarettes were associated with greater Cmax (25.9 v. 9.0, p = 0.0043) and greater nicotine boost (21.0 v. 8.2, p = 0.0128). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced e-cigarettes delivered significantly more nicotine than first-generation devices but less than combustible cigarettes. Overall, e-cigarette use was associated with a reduction in withdrawal and craving with no reported side effects.

METHODS: A representative poll of 851 smokers in Metropolitan Santiago de Chile, which comprises 40% of the country's total population, was implemented in mid-2017. Smokers were given a questionnaire that collected socio-demographic information and information on smoking patterns. Four discrete-choice models were estimated on the decision to smoke flavor capsule cigarettes to better understand the statistical relationships between traits of smokers and the consumption of flavor capsule cigarettes. RESULTS: The results of these models show that each year less in a smoker's age increases the likelihood of preferring flavor capsule cigarettes by, on average, between 0.8 and 0.9 percentage points. If the smoker is a woman, the likelihood of preferring flavor capsule cigarettes increases between 13.4 and 13.5 percentage points. Results also reveal a positive relationship between the price paid and the consumption of flavor capsule cigarettes, indicating that these cigarettes tend to be more expensive. There is no statistical relationship between participation in the labor market and smoking these products. CONCLUSIONS: Chile has the world's highest prevalence of flavor capsule cigarette smoking, which is concentrated among young people (25 years and younger) and females. No relationship between socioeconomic status and use of these products is found, though there are indications that such relationship may exist, as they were at the time of study 14% more expensive, on average, than conventional non-flavored cigarettes. As in most countries, the tobacco industry appears to be deliberately promoting these products with the goal of halting or slowing the decline in cigarette consumption in Chile. Thus, to reduce cigarette consumption (especially among youth), restricting or forbidding cigarette flavorings of all types, including flavor capsules, would be an effective strategy.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Snus products are available as fine-cut loose tobacco or in pre-portioned porous ""pouches."" Some snus products undergo tobacco pasteurization during manufacturing, a process that removes or reduces nitrite-forming microbes, resulting in less tobacco-specific nitrosamine content in the product. Some tobacco companies and researchers have suggested that snus is potentially less harmful than traditional tobacco and thus a potential smoking cessation aid or an alternative to continued cigarette consumption. Although snus is available in various countries, limited information exists on snus variants from different manufacturers. METHODS: Moisture, pH, nicotine, and tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines (TSNAs) were quantified in 64 snus products made by 10 manufacturers in the United States and Northern Europe (NE). Reported means, standard errors, and differences are least-square (LS) estimates from bootstrapped mixed effects models, which accounted for correlation among repeated measurements. Minor alkaloids and select flavors were also measured. RESULTS: Among all product types, moisture (27.4%-59.5%), pH (pH 5.87-9.10), total nicotine (6.81-20.6 mg/g, wet), unprotonated nicotine (0.083-15.7 mg/g), and total TSNAs (390-4,910 ng/g) varied widely. The LS-mean unprotonated nicotine concentration of NE portion (7.72 mg/g, SE = 0.963) and NE loose (5.06 mg/g, SE = 1.26) snus were each significantly higher than US portion snus (1.00 mg/g, SE = 1.56). Concentrations of minor alkaloids varied most among products with the highest total nicotine levels. The LS-mean NNN+NNK were higher in snus sold in the US (1360 ng/g, SE = 207) than in NE (836 ng/g, SE = 132) countries. The most abundant flavor compounds detected were pulegone, eucalyptol, and menthol. CONCLUSION: Physical and chemical characteristics of US and NE products labeled as snus can vary considerably and should not be considered ""equivalent"". Our findings could inform public health and policy decisions pertaining to snus exposure and potential adverse health effects associated with snus.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Around the same time, several changes to the tax system were applied (a Minimum Excise Tax (MET) for FM products and tax increases weighted towards RYO products). The tobacco industry claims that standardised packaging will lower prices (a disincentive for quitting) by commoditising the product, yet had itself taken advantage of the previous tax regime to achieve large profits from premium brands while also keeping some products' prices relatively low. Here we evaluate the impact of standardised packaging, the MET and the RYO focussed tax changes on price and industry profitability. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Nielsen electronic point of sale (EPOS) data (May 2015 to April 2018) were used to calculate real (inflation adjusted) monthly price per stick overall, by cigarette type (FM and RYO) and by seven market segments. Trend estimation, using additive mixed models, assessed weighted average price (weighted by volume of sales) and tobacco industry net revenue changes. The beginning and end of the data series were compared in terms of: (a) average monthly price growth, (b) average monthly net revenue growth, and (c) undershifting and overshifting patterns after tax changes. FM and RYO real prices changed little over the 3-year period-overall prices rose by about 1p per stick. There was no evidence of commoditisation with prices of all FM segments (but not RYO) rising faster after the implementation of standardised packaging than immediately beforehand. The prices of the cheapest FM brands rose with the implementation of the MET. RYO price increases did not close the gap to FM pricing levels despite RYO focussed tax increases. Tax changes following the implementation of standardised packaging and the MET were more widely and quickly passed on to smokers in the form of higher prices than the tax change pre-implementation. The main limitations are first that because we do not know the exact mechanism by which Nielsen scales up sample data to provide UK estimates, we could only use data for a set three year period during which the same adjustments are made. Second, the tax and standardised packaging events were sometimes too close in time to separate their consequences statistically. Third, tobacco prices may also be affected by external factors such as changes in smokers' disposable income or availability of electronic nicotine delivery systems. CONCLUSIONS: There was no long-term lowering of tobacco prices after the implementation of standardised packaging as predicted by the industry. The introduction of the MET was successful in increasing the price of the cheapest FM cigarettes and narrowing the price gap between FM brands. The RYO tax increases were, however, insufficient to narrow the price gap between RYO and FM. Overall, undershifting became less extensive indicating that tobacco industry manipulation of the tax system which had previously kept cheap products available had declined. This suggests that standardised packaging and a MET will likely contribute to further declines in UK tobacco use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

PARTICIPANTS: US adult (ages 18+) daily cigarette smokers identified at Wave 1 (W1; 2013-14) of the PATH Study, who reported a quit attempt before W2 and completed W3 (n = 2443). EXPOSURES: Use of e-cigarettes, pharmacotherapy (including nicotine replacement therapy), or no product for last quit attempt (LQA), and current daily e-cigarette use at W2. ANALYSIS: Propensity score matching (PSM) of groups using different methods to quit. OUTCOME MEASURES: 12+ months abstinence at W3 from cigarettes and from all tobacco (including e-cigarettes). 30+ days abstinence at W3 was a secondary outcome. RESULTS: Among daily smokers with an LQA, 23.5% used e-cigarettes, 19.3% used pharmacotherapy only (including NRT) and 57.2% used no product. Cigarette abstinence for 12+ months at W3 was ~10% in each group. Half of the cigarette abstainers in the e-cigarette group were using e-cigarettes at W3. Different methods to help quitting had statistically comparable 12+ month cigarette abstinence at W3 (e-cigarettes vs no product: Risk Difference (RD) = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.06; e-cigarettes vs pharmacotherapy: RD = 0.02, 95% CI:-0.04 to 0.09). Likewise, daily e-cigarette users at W2 did not show a cessation benefit over comparable no-e-cigarette users and this finding was robust to sensitivity analyses. Abstinence for 30+ days at W3 was also similar across products. LIMITATIONS: The frequency of e-cigarette use during the LQA was not assessed, nor was it possible to assess continuous abstinence from the LQA. CONCLUSION: Among US daily smokers who quit cigarettes in 2014-15, use of e-cigarettes in that attempt compared to approved cessation aids or no products showed similar abstinence rates 1-2 years later.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

The present study, conducted in four high-income countries during the first global wave of COVID-19, examined the association between COVID-19 and: (1) thoughts about quitting smoking; (2) changes in smoking (quit attempt, reduced or increased smoking, or no change); and (3) factors related to a positive change (making a quit attempt or reducing smoking) based on an adapted framework of the Health Belief Model. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 6870 adult smokers participating in the Wave 3 (2020) ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey conducted in Australia, Canada, England, and United States (US). These four countries had varying responses to the pandemic by governments and public health, ranging from advising voluntary social distancing to implementing national and subnational staged lockdowns. Considering these varying responses, and the differences in the number of confirmed cases and deaths (greatest in England and the US and lowest in Australia), smoking behaviours related to COVID-19 may have differed between countries. Other factors that may be related to changes in smoking because of COVID-19 were also explored (e.g., sociodemographics, nicotine dependence, perceptions about personal and general risks of smoking on COVID-19). Regression analyses were conducted on weighted data. RESULTS: Overall, 46.7% of smokers reported thinking about quitting because of COVID-19, which differed by country (p<0.001): England highest (50.9%) and Australia lowest (37.6%). Thinking about quitting smoking because of COVID-19 was more frequent among: females, ethnic minorities, those with financial stress, current vapers, less dependent smokers (non-daily and fewer cigarettes smoked/day), those with greater concern about personal susceptibility of infection, and those who believe COVID-19 is more severe for smokers. Smoking behaviour changes due to COVID-19 were: 1.1% attempted to quit, 14.2% reduced smoking, and 14.6% increased smoking (70.2% reported no change). Positive behaviour change (tried to quit/reduced smoking) was reported by 15.5% of smokers, which differed by country (p = 0.02), where Australia had significantly lower rates than the other three countries. A positive behavioural smoking change was more likely among smokers with: lower dependence, greater concern about personal susceptibility to infection, and believing that COVID-19 is more severe for smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Though nearly half of smokers reported thinking about quitting because of COVID-19, the vast majority did not change their smoking behaviour. Smokers were more likely to try and quit or reduce their smoking if they had greater concern about susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 related to smoking. Smokers in Australia were least likely to reduce or try to quit smoking, which could be related to the significantly lower impact of COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic relative to the other countries.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Evidence underpinning e-cigarettes policy recommendations has been necessarily limited due to the novelty of the technology and the lack of long-term epidemiological studies and trials. Some public health bodies have actively encouraged e-cigarette use whilst others have raised concerns over introducing new health risks and renormalising tobacco smoking. Using citation network analysis we investigated the author conflicts of interest and study funding statements within sources of evidence used by public health bodies when making recommendations about e-cigarette policy. METHODS: We conducted citation network analysis of public health recommendation documents across four purposively selected diverse jurisdictions: WHO, UK, Australia, and USA. We extracted all citations from 15 public health recommendation documents, with more detailed data collected for influential citations (used in 3+ recommendation documents). We analysed the relationships between the sources of evidence used across jurisdictions using block modelling to determine if similar groups of documents were used across different jurisdictions. We assessed the frequency and nature of conflicts of interest. RESULTS: 1700 unique citations were included across the 15 public health recommendation documents, with zero to 923 citations per document (median = 63, IQR = 7.5-132). The evidence base underpinning public health recommendations did not systematically differ across jurisdictions. Of the 1700 citations included, the majority were journal articles (n = 1179). Across 1081 journal articles published between 1998-2018, 200 declared a conflict of interest, 288 contained no mention of conflicts of interest, and 593 declared none. Conflicts of interest were reported with tobacco (3%; n = 37 journal articles of 1081), e-cigarette (7%; n = 72), and pharmaceutical companies (12%; n = 127), with such conflicts present even in the most recent years. There were 53 influential citations, the most common study type was basic science research without human subjects (e.g. examination of aerosols and e-liquids) (n = 18) followed by systematic review (n = 10); with randomised control trial being least common (n = 4). Network analysis identified clusters of highly-cited articles with a higher prevalence of conflicts of interest. CONCLUSION: Public health bodies across different jurisdictions drew upon similar sources of evidence, despite articulating different policy approaches to e-cigarettes. The evidence drawn upon, including the most influential evidence, contained substantial conflicts of interest (including relationships with e-cigarette and tobacco industries). Processes to explicitly manage conflicts of interest arising from the underlying evidence base may be required when developing public health recommendations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In this study, we analyze whether someone's genetic predisposition to smoking moderates the response to tobacco excise taxes. METHODS: We interact polygenic scores for smoking behavior with state-level tobacco excise taxes in longitudinal data (1992-2016) from the US Health and Retirement Study (N = 12,058). RESULTS: Someone's genetic propensity to smoking moderates the effect of tobacco excise taxes on smoking behavior along the extensive margin (smoking vs. not smoking) and the intensive margin (the amount of tobacco consumed). In our analysis sample, we do not find a significant gene-environment interaction effect on smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: When tobacco excise taxes are relatively high, those with a high genetic predisposition to smoking are less likely (i) to smoke, and (ii) to smoke heavily. While tobacco excise taxes have been effective in reducing smoking, the gene-environment interaction effects we observe in our sample suggest that policy makers could benefit from taking into account the moderating role of genes in the design of future tobacco control policies.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Currently, commercial e-liquid and oral pouch products are available that contain tobacco-free nicotine, which could be either extracted from tobacco or synthesized. While tobacco products that contain TDN are regulated by FDA Center for Tobacco Products, those with SyN are currently not in the domain of any regulatory authority. This regulatory difference provides an economic incentive to use or claim the use of SyN to remain on the market without submitting a Premarket Tobacco Product Application. TDN is ~99.3% (S)-nicotine, whereas SyN can vary from racemic (50/50 (R)/(S)) to ≥ 99% (S)-nicotine, i.e., chemically identical to the tobacco-derived compound. Here we report efforts to distinguish between TDN and SyN in various samples by characterizing impurities, (R)/(S)-nicotine enantiomer ratio, (R)/(S)-nornicotine enantiomer ratio, and carbon-14 (14C) content. Only 14C analysis accurately and precisely differentiated TDN (100% 14C) from SyN (35-38% 14C) in all samples tested. 14C quantitation of nicotine samples by accelerator mass spectrometry is a reliable determinate of nicotine source and can be used to identify misbranded product labelled as containing SyN. This is the first report to distinguish natural, bio-based nicotine from synthetic, petroleum-based nicotine across a range of pure nicotine samples and commercial e-liquid products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Perceptions of risk and benefits determine diverse framings of the e-cigarette debate and complicate policy decisions. E-cigarette use by smokers who are attempting to quit may result in improved health outcomes, while their use among young people and non-smokers may lead to adverse health consequences. The purpose of this study was to identify the types of evidence used during public consultations on proposed revisions to New Zealand's e-cigarette legislation in 2020. METHODS: Using submissions to parliament made by the tobacco/e-cigarette industry and the health sector, we assessed the cited evidence for quality and independence measured by publication type and tobacco industry connections. We identified themes from a sub-sample of frequently cited evidence to understand how stakeholders and organisations used evidence. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 57 submissions from the e-cigarette and tobacco industry (n = 21) and health organisations (n = 36). A total of 442 pieces of evidence were cited at least once. Health organisations were more likely to cite peer-reviewed evidence (OR = 2.99). The industry was more likely to cite evidence outside of peer review and sources with tobacco industry connections (OR = 4.08). In the sample of frequently cited evidence, youth prevalence and flavours were the most common themes. In some cases the same evidence was used by both groups to support opposing policy positions. CONCLUSIONS: The industry continues to rely more heavily on evidence published outside of the peer-review process, which is, therefore, subjected to less scientific scrutiny. By using a smoking-cessation or harm-reduction narrative, the industry could be seen as a legitimate stakeholder in policy development.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study explored news media coverage of arguments and activities in relation to the South African lockdown tobacco sales ban. We collected media articles published between 26 March to 17 August 2020, which corresponded to the period of the sales ban. Data were sourced via google search and snowball identification of relevant articles. Thematic analysis of data was conducted with the aid of NVivo. We analysed a total of 305 articles relevant to the South African tobacco sales ban during the lockdown. Six major themes were identified in the data: challenges associated with implementing the ban, litigation, and threats of litigation to remove the ban, governance process and politicization of the ban, pro and anti-tobacco sales ban activities and arguments and reactions to the announcement lifting the ban. The initial reason for placing the ban was due to the non-classification of tobacco products as an essential item. Early findings of a link between tobacco smoking and COVID-19 disease severity led to an extension of the ban to protect South Africa's fragile health system. Pro-sales ban arguments included the importance of protecting the health system from collapse due to rising COVID-19 hospitalization, benefit of cessation, and the need for non-smokers to be protected from exposure to secondhand smoke. Anti-sales ban arguments included the adverse effect of nicotine withdrawal symptoms on smokers, loss of jobs and the expansion of the illicit cigarette markets. Litigation against the ban's legality was a strategy used by the tobacco industry to mobilize the public against the ban while promoting their business through the distribution of branded masks and door-to-door delivery which goes against current tobacco regulations. The media could serve as a veritable tool to promote public health if engaged in productive ways to communicate and promote public health regulations to the general population. Engagement with the media should be enhanced as part of health promotion strategies.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Precisely how to incorporate pathway knowledge in genetic association studies is not yet clear, however. Previous approaches employ a two-step approach, in which a regular association test is first performed to identify variants associated with the disease phenotype, followed by a test for functional enrichment within the genes implicated by those variants. Here we introduce a concise one-step approach, Hierarchical Genetic Analysis (Higana), which directly computes phenotype associations against each function in the large hierarchy of biological functions documented by the Gene Ontology. Using this approach, we identify risk genes and functions for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), highlighting microtubule transport, muscle adaptation, and nicotine receptor signaling pathways. Microtubule transport has not been previously linked to COPD, as it integrates genetic variants spread over numerous genes.

We aimed to examine the impact of the cost-of-living crisis in Great Britain on the nature of smoking cessation and alcohol reduction attempts, and explore changes in health professionals offering support. METHODS: Data were from 14,567 past-year smokers and high-risk drinkers (AUDIT-C ≥5) participating in monthly representative surveys, January-2021 through December-2022. We estimated time trends in cost as a motive driving the most recent (smoking cessation/alcohol reduction) attempt, use of paid or evidence-based support, and receipt of GP offer of support for smoking cessation or alcohol reduction, and tested for moderation by occupational social grade. RESULTS: The proportion of attempts motivated by cost did not change significantly over time among smokers (25.4% [95%CI = 23.8-26.9%]), but increased between December-2021 and December-2022 among high-risk drinkers from less advantaged social grades (from 15.3% [95%CI 12.1-19.3] to 29.7% [20.1-44.1]). The only change in support use was an increase in smokers using paid support, specifically e-cigarettes (from 28.1% [23.7-33.3] to 38.2% [33.0-44.4]). Among those visiting their GP, the proportion who received an offer of support was similar over time among smokers (27.0% [25.7-28.2]) and high-risk drinkers (1.4% [1.1-1.6%]). CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence that the 2021/22 cost-of-living crisis affected the nature of attempts to stop smoking and reduce alcohol consumption, or receipt of GP offer of support. It is encouraging that use of evidence-based support has not declined and that use of e-cigarettes in quit attempts has increased. However, cost is increasingly motivating alcohol reduction attempts among less advantaged drinkers, and rates of GPs offering support, especially for alcohol reduction, remain very low.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,No,

Given its novelty, it is important to understand where young adults learn about NTN ENDS. This study examined sources of exposure to NTN ENDS and relationships with NTN ENDS use and susceptibility. METHODS: We analyzed online survey data collected in Fall 2021 from 642 young adults (18-25 years) who had heard of NTN ENDS. We assessed 9 sources of NTN ENDS exposure (e.g., retail stores, social media) and examined associations between sources of exposure and NTN current (past-month) use, lifetime (non-current) use, and susceptibility to use, adjusting for demographics and other tobacco product use. RESULTS: Participants reported current NTN ENDS use (37.4%), lifetime use (12.0%), susceptibility (18.5%), or no susceptibility to use (32.1%). The most common sources of NTN ENDS exposure were retail stores (87.7%) and social media (81.0%). Exposure to NTN ENDS via social media was associated with greater odds of current NTN ENDS use (vs. no susceptibility) (aOR = 1.83, 95%CI: 1.02-3.28). Exposure via online streaming platforms was associated with greater odds of current (aOR = 1.75, 95%CI: 1.08-2.82) and lifetime NTN ENDS use (aOR = 2.42, 95%CI: 1.25-4.68). CONCLUSIONS: Young adults were exposed to and learned about NTN ENDS from diverse sources, primarily retail shops and social media. Further, exposure via social media and streaming platforms were associated with NTN ENDS use. Future studies should explore the content of NTN information from various sources to inform prevention efforts.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We examined e-cigarette advertising exposure and its associations with curiosity and susceptibility across multiple years among adolescents who have never used e-cigarettes. METHODS: We obtained data from the National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTSs), 2014-2020 (N = 97,496). The NYTS identified e-cigarette advertising exposure from four channels: Internet, newspapers and magazines, convenience stores, and TV. Logistic regressions explored e-cigarette advertising exposure over time and the associations between exposure from the four channels and both curiosity and susceptibility to using e-cigarettes. RESULTS: Youth exposure to e-cigarette advertising on the Internet and in convenience stores formed an increase-decrease-increase pattern from 2014 to 2020, whereas exposure in newspapers and magazines and on TV generally decreased over this period. Exposure on the Internet and in convenience stores was consistently associated with curiosity and susceptibility; but exposure in newspapers and magazines and on TV was sporadically associated with the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a changing e-cigarette marketplace, youth were consistently exposed to e-cigarette advertising, especially on the Internet and in convenience stores. This pattern is worrisome, as it may increase youth curiosity and susceptibility to using e-cigarettes. Comprehensive tobacco prevention efforts to prevent e-cigarette use in adolescents should continue to restrict e-cigarette advertising and marketing, thereby reducing exposure and discouraging e-cigarette use. Regular efforts should also be made to educate adolescents about the risks of using e-cigarettes to counteract the impact of high e-cigarette advertising exposure.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Using e-cigarettes causes different types of adverse health effects both in adults and elderly people. Over time, using e-cigarettes has detrimental consequences on lung function, brain development and numerous other illnesses. METHODS: This study employed a mixed-methods conducted between June and September 2023, comprising two phases: Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping of available e-cigarette point-of-sale (POS) locations and conducting 15 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with e-cigarette retailers, along with 5 key informant interviews (KIIs) involving tobacco control activists and policy experts. ArcGIS was employed for spatial analysis, creating distribution and type maps, and buffer and multi-buffer ring analyses were conducted to assess proximity to hospitals and academic institutions. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics for GIS mapping and qualitative analysis for interview transcripts, utilizing a priori codebook and thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 276 POS were mapped in the entire Dhaka city. About 55 POS were found within 100m distance from academic institutions in Dhaka city, which offers the easy accessibility of young generations to e-cigarettes. The younger generation is becoming the major target for e-cigarettes because of their alluring flavors, appealing looks, and variation in flavors. Sellers have been using different marketing tactics such as postering, offering discounts and using internet marketing on social media. Moreover, they try to convince the customers by saying that e-cigarettes are 'not harmful' or 'less harmful'. However, retailers were mostly taking e-cigarettes from local wholesalers or distributors. Customers buy these products both from in-store and online services. Due to the absence of laws and regulations on e-cigarettes in Bangladesh, the availability, marketing, and selling of e-cigarettes are increasing alarmingly. CONCLUSION: E-cigarette retail shops are mostly surrounded by academic institutions, and it is expanding. Besides, frequent exposure, easy accessibility, and tactful promotion encourage the younger generations to consume e-cigarettes. The government should take necessary control measures on manufacturing, storage, advertising, promotion, sponsorship, marketing, distribution, sale, import, and export in order to safeguard the health and safety of young and future generations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The internal quality of the cigarettes is highly related to the chemical components of tobacco leaves and shreds. Blue mold severity (BMS), chlorophyll (Chl), total nitrogen (N), sugar (S), nicotine (Nt), chloride (Cl), and potassium (K) contents of tobacco leaves are linked to the flavor and taste of cigarette products. A precise analysis of the effects of these factors would open the door for improving farmer income in low- and middle-income countries. In this study, BMS, Chl, N, S, Nt, Cl, K, green weight (GW), dry weight (DW), and leaf quality of four cultivars, including Bergerac, Bell, Burly, and Basma, were evaluated during two growing seasons. Bell displayed the highest leaf quality in two growing seasons. Multiple linear regression, stepwise regression, ordinary least squares regression, partial least squares regression, principal component regression, and multilayer perceptron neural network-genetic algorithm (MLPNN-GA) were used for the prediction of tobacco leaf quality responding to BMS, Chl, N, S, Nt, Cl, K. MLPNN-GA models displayed higher prediction accuracy compared with the best regression model according to R2 for MLPNN-GA vs. regression models were: Bergerac; 1.00 vs. 0.82, Bell = 1.00 vs. 0.41, Burly = 1.00 vs. 0.68, Basma = 0.94 vs. 0.68, and all cultivars = 0.94 vs. 0.66. The close match between the predicted and actual data validated the superior efficiency of the developed MLNNP-GA models for predicting tobacco leaf quality responding to BMS, Chl, N, S, Nt, Cl, K. Analysis of the developed MLPNN-GA models showed that Bergerac, Bell, Burly, and Basma leaf quality was most sensitive to BMS. MLPNN-GA was demonstrated to be a practical mathematical tool for predicting tobacco leaf quality in response to its chemical components and BMS.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

They are being heavily promoted through mass media advertising. Advertising spots on radio, television, and in the printed media use well-known sports personalities and entertainers to act as spokesmen for smokeless tobacco. Despite the esthetic drawbacks of these social acceptance. This is being accomplished, at least in part, through a skillful manipulation of the public by the tobacco industry. Use of smokeless tobacco is rapidly increasing, especially among young male athletes and students in high school and college. Advertising implies that smokeless tobacco habits are innocuous and safe. They are not. Smokeless tobacco products have shown that potential for causing cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and eophagus. A review of the medical and dental literature has shown 646 cases of cancer associated directly with smokeless tobacco. Smokeless tobacco can produce significant effects on the soft and hard tissues of the mouth, including bad breath, discolored teeth and restorations, excessive wear (abrasion) of the incisal and occlusal surfaces of the teeth, decreased ability to taste and small, gingival recession, advanced periodontal destruction of the soft and hard tissues, erythema of the soft tissues, leukoplakia, and cancer. Health professionals are urged to advise their patients concerning the hazards of using smokeless tobacco and to take a strong public stance in opposition to the current advertising campaigns aimed at youth.

American Society of Clinical Oncology. Annual Meeting,"Tobacco and lung cancer: risks, trends, and outcomes in patients with cancer.","Tobacco use, primarily associated with cigarette smoking, is the largest preventable cause of cancer mortality, responsible for approximately one-third of all cancer deaths. Approximately 85% of lung cancers result from smoking, with an additional fraction caused by secondhand smoke exposure in nonsmokers. The risk of lung cancer is dose dependent, but can be dramatically reduced with tobacco cessation, especially if the person discontinues smoking early in life. The increase in lung cancer incidence in different countries around in the world parallels changes in cigarette consumption. Lung cancer risks are not reduced by switching to filters or low-tar/low-nicotine cigarettes. In patients with cancer, continued tobacco use after diagnosis is associated with poor therapeutic outcomes including increased treatment-related toxicity, increased risk of second primary cancer, decreased quality of life, and decreased survival. Tobacco cessation in patients with cancer may improve cancer treatment outcomes, but cessation support is often not provided by oncologists. Reducing the health related effects of tobacco requires coordinated efforts to reduce exposure to tobacco, accurately assess tobacco use in clinical settings, and increase access to tobacco cessation support. Lung cancer screening and coordinated international tobacco control efforts offer the promise to dramatically reduce lung cancer mortality in the coming decades.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Sixty of these destroyed documents were subsequently uncovered in British American Tobacco's files. METHODS: Legal counsel for Imperial Tobacco Canada provided a list of 60 destroyed documents to British American Tobacco. Information in this list was used to search for copies of the documents in British American Tobacco files released through court disclosure. We reviewed and summarized this information. RESULTS: Imperial Tobacco destroyed documents that included evidence from scientific reviews prepared by British American Tobacco's researchers, as well as 47 original research studies, 35 of which examined the biological activity and carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke. The documents also describe British American Tobacco research on cigarette modifications and toxic emissions, including the ways in which consumers adapted their smoking behaviour in response to these modifications. The documents also depict a comprehensive research program on the pharmacology of nicotine and the central role of nicotine in smoking behaviour. British American Tobacco scientists noted that "".. the present scale of the tobacco industry is largely dependent on the intensity and nature of the pharmacological action of nicotine,"" and that ""... should nicotine become less attractive to smokers, the future of the tobacco industry would become less secure."" INTERPRETATION: The scientific evidence contained in the documents destroyed by Imperial Tobacco demonstrates that British American Tobacco had collected evidence that cigarette smoke was carcinogenic and addictive. The evidence that Imperial Tobacco sought to destroy had important implications for government regulation of tobacco.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This Food and Drug Administration regulatory decision draws attention to the growing worldwide use of smokeless tobacco products in general. Use of these tobacco products is particularly popular in low- and middle-income countries of Asia. Due to aggressive and strategic marketing to children, young adults, and current smokers, rates of smokeless tobacco use in men of all ages are on the rise in United States and elsewhere. The tobacco industry also continues to market these products to current cigarette smokers for use in the growing number of ""smoke-free environments."" Smokeless tobacco products are associated with cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, particularly the oral cavity, esophagus, and pancreas; cardiovascular diseases; small-for-gestational-age infants; premature births; increased risk of apnea; and stillbirth. There is no convincing evidence regarding the efficacy of smokeless tobacco, including snus, to promote smoking cessation. Rather, studies from Europe and the United States demonstrate that smokeless tobacco use may facilitate regular cigarette smoking by acting as a gateway drug, especially for children. Caution is warranted before proposing smokeless tobacco as a harm-reduction strategy, in part because of the potential for further promoting smokeless tobacco in low- and middle-income countries where use is already widespread. Continued vigilance through comprehensive surveillance is warranted. We strongly recommend the use of graphic warning labels as a ""no regrets"" strategy for all smokeless tobacco products marketed globally.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The European Commission is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of its tobacco regulations. This article aims to address critical inquiries that arise during the amendment of the regulatory framework. We evaluate the effectiveness of existing tobacco control methods and observe a diminishing impact on promoting smoking cessation. Additionally, we explore how individuals of varying genders respond to the regulatory environment. We propose a comprehensive and evidence-based framework for implementing a taxation system in response to the proliferation of emerging products, including e-cigarettes and heated tobacco. This system is designed to align effectively with health policy objectives, providing a strategic approach to curbing tobacco use and promoting public health.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Smoking tobacco products included Hookah, Cohutta, Chillum, Chillum, ganja, Beedi, Mava, Cigarettes, and cigar etc. Various types of smokeless tobacco like betel quid, khaini, mishri, snuff, gutkha are used. Fifty percent of them are addicted to smokeless tobacco. Sixty eight smokeless tobacco products were available in 2010; most of them included the risk of cancer warning except for loose tobacco products. Women mostly prefer 8 out of 29 gutkha brands. Out of these 29 gutkha brands, 15 were loose tobacco packets. India is the second-largest tobacco consumer, comprises of 27.5 crore consumers which altogether greater than the population of Western Europe. From among these 27.5 crore consumers, 16.4 crore people are smokeless tobacco in takers, 6.9 crore people are exclusive smokers and 4.2 crore people are both tobacco in takers and exclusive smokers. If we take this data into consideration early mortality of 45 crore people is expected by 2050 worldwide. Female basically are prone to fewer cigarettes per day as compared to males. On the other hand, a cigarette that is consumed by females has lower nicotine content as compared to males. In developing countries, the female population has less prevalence of smoking because the level of employment is low, socio-cultural norms, and health and beauty concerns. According to the estimation by the South East Asia Region (SEAR) in the year 2000 basically from India, we encounter death of about 18% men and about 3% of women due to tobacco. Various policies have been set up to control the use of tobacco. So that threat to public health is reduced. Policies like tobacco control policy, pro-health policy are set up for this purpose.

Accordingly, knowledge on the chemical properties and free radical formation during tobacco burning is an important subject towards unravelling the relationship between smoking behaviour and disease. This review investigates how scientific efforts have been advanced towards understanding the release of molecular products from the thermal degradation of tobacco, and harm reduction strategies among cigarette smokers in general. The mechanistic characteristics of nicotine and selected aldehydes are critically examined in this review. For the purpose of this work, articles published during the period 2004-2021 and archived in PubMed, Google Scholar, Medley, Cochrane, and Web of Science were used. The articles were selected based on the health impacts of cigarette smoking, tobacco burning kinetics, tobacco cessation and tobacco as a precursor for emerging diseases such as Covid-19. CONTENT: The toxicity of cigarette smoke is directly correlated with its chemical composition derived from the pyrolysis of tobacco stem and leaves. Most of the harmful toxic substances are generated by pyrolysis during smoking and depends on pyrolysis conditions. Detailed studies have been conducted on the kinetics of nicotine by use of robust theoretical models in order to determine the rate constants of reactions in nicotine and those of nicotine dissociation via C-C and C-N scission, yielding pyridinyl and methyl radicals, respectively. Research has suggested that acetaldehyde enhances the effect of nicotine, which in turn reinforces addiction characteristics whereas acrolein and crotonaldehyde are ciliatoxic, and can inhibit lung clearance. On the other hand, phenol affects liver enzymes, lungs, kidneys, and the cardiovascular system while m-cresol attacks the nervous system. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK: The characteristics of chemical release during tobacco burning are very important in the tobacco industry and the cigarette smoking community. Understanding individual chemical formation from cigarette smoking will provide the necessary information needed to formulate sound tobacco reform policies from a chemical standpoint. Nonetheless, intense research is needed in this field in order to prescribe possible measures to deter cigarette smoking addiction and ameliorate the grave miseries bedevilling the tobacco smoking community.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Nicotine and nicotinic agonists may have a therapeutic potential for a variety of disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, depression, attention deficit disorder, Tourette's syndrome and ulcerative colitis. These interests are partially fuelled by the urgent need of the tobacco industry to find new niches for nicotine in a world bound eventually to retire from cigarette smoking. At the same time, there is an increased interest in developing drugs for fighting obesity, a growing affliction of industrialised nations. This review presents data on the potential of nicotine, and in particular synthetic nicotinic agonists, for controlling body weight. Nicotinic agonists may become relatively safe, effective and inexpensive alternatives for several optional drugs currently being developed for treating human obesity, including beta-3-adrenergic agonists, leptin and its agonists, and neuropeptide Y antagonists.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Local communities have responded by prohibiting the distribution and/or redemption of coupons at retail locations, yet evidence that this policy diminishes product purchases and use intentions is lacking. The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate whether elimination of price discounts from retail locations influences use intentions for smokeless tobacco, little cigars/cigarillos (LCCs), and electronic cigarettes (ENDS) in young adults. METHODS: Participants were 298 college students recruited from the community. They participated in a simulated shopping task in the RAND StoreLab, a life-sized replica of a mid-sized convenience store. They were randomized into one of two conditions: Price discounts present (store tobacco posters displayed price discount information) or price discounts absent (no price discount information displayed on posters). The dependent measure was post-shopping intentions to use smokeless tobacco, LCCs, and ENDS. RESULTS: Exposure to the price discounts absent condition led to a lower susceptibility of using smokeless tobacco compared to exposure to the price discounts present condition (aOR = 0.48 [95% CI, 0.23, 0.98]). Experimental condition was not related to LCC use susceptibility (aOR = 1.46 [95% CI, 0.70, 3.03]) or to ENDS use susceptibility (aOR = 0.89 [95% CI, 0.40, 1.95]). CONCLUSIONS: These results support eliminating tobacco discounts from retail locations, at least for reducing college students' desire to use some tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Developing from this are electronic nicotine delivery systems or vapes, promulgated as being less harmful than tobacco. Nicotine itself is toxic to the foetus, with permanent effects on lung structure and function. Most vapes contain nicotine, but they also contain many other compounds which are inhaled and for which there are no toxicity studies. They also contain known toxic substances, whose use is banned by European Union legislation. Accelerating numbers of young people are vaping, and this does not reflect an exchange of vapes for cigarettes. The acute toxicity of e-cigarettes is greater than that of tobacco, and includes acute lung injury, pulmonary haemorrhage and eosinophilic and lipoid pneumonia. Given the worse acute toxicity, it should be impossible to be complacent about medium and long term effects of vaping. Laboratory studies have demonstrated changes in lung proteomics and the innate immune system with vaping, some but not all of which overlap with tobacco. It would be wrong to consider vapes as a weaker form of tobacco, they have their own toxicity. Children and young people are being targeted by the vaping industry (which is largely the same as the tobacco industry), including on-line, and unless an efficient legislative program is put in place, a whole new generation of nicotine addicts will result.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Research, however, has failed to show a reduction in smoking-related health risks, an increase in rates of smoking cessation, a decrease in the amount of carbon monoxide or tar released, or a reduction in the rates of cardiovascular disease or lung cancer associated with light cigarette use, compared with regular cigarette use. Nevertheless, more than one-half of adolescent smokers in the United States smoke light cigarettes. This study is the first to investigate adolescents' perception of the risks associated with smoking light cigarettes, as well as adolescents' attitudes and knowledge about the delivery of tar and nicotine, health risks, social effects, addiction potential, and ease of cessation with light cigarettes, compared with regular cigarettes. DESIGN: Participants were 267 adolescents (mean age: 14.0 years) who completed a self-administered questionnaire during class time. After reading scenarios in which they imagined that they smoked regular or light cigarettes, participants estimated the chances that they would personally experience 7 smoking-related health risks and 3 addiction risks. Participants also responded to 14 items concerning their attitudes and knowledge about light cigarettes versus regular cigarettes. RESULTS: Participants thought that they would be significantly less likely to get lung cancer, have a heart attack, die from a smoking-related disease, get a bad cough, have trouble breathing, and get wrinkles when smoking light cigarettes, compared with regular cigarettes, for the rest of their lives. Furthermore, when participants were asked how long it would take to become addicted to the 2 cigarette types, they thought it would take significantly longer to become addicted to light versus regular cigarettes. Adolescents also thought that their chances of being able to quit smoking were higher with light versus regular cigarettes. Similarly, when participants were asked how easy it would be to quit smoking the 2 cigarette types, they thought it would be significantly easier for them to quit smoking light cigarettes than regular cigarettes. Adolescents agreed or strongly agreed that regular cigarettes deliver more tar than light cigarettes and that light cigarettes deliver less nicotine than regular cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results of this study show that adolescents hold misperceptions in both their personal risk estimates and their general attitudes about the health risks, addictive properties, and ease of cessation associated with light cigarettes. With a variety of light and ultralight cigarettes on the market, adolescents are led to think that there is a progression of safety levels to choose from when deciding which cigarettes to smoke. This illusion of control over health outcomes contributes to an underestimation of risks associated with smoking light cigarettes and supports these misperceptions. These results are of concern, given evidence suggesting that, if adolescents think they are less vulnerable to smoking-related health risks (ie, lung cancer), then they are more likely to initiate smoking. Furthermore, there is evidence that adolescents are not fully aware of the addictive nature of cigarettes and therefore think that they can experiment with smoking during adolescence without becoming addicted or experiencing any health consequences. The data presented here support concerns regarding smoking addiction; adolescents might be even more inclined to smoke light cigarettes to delay addiction. Without correct information about light cigarettes, adolescents are unable to make informed decisions about their smoking behaviors. The findings presented here strongly suggest that health care practitioners need to talk to their adolescent clients not only about the overall risks of smoking but also about the specific risks associated with smoking light cigarettes and other tobacco varieties, including the potential for addiction and long-term health consequences. Information shared with adolescents about light cigarettes, both individually by health care practitioners and at the population level via counter-advertising campaigns, may be successful in changing current misperceptions, and ultimately light cigarette smoking patterns, among youth.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

We sought to identify the presence of chemical toxicants associated with e-cigarette use among adolescents. METHODS: Adolescent e-cigarette users (≥1 use within the past 30 days, ≥10 lifetime e-cigarette use episodes) were divided into e-cigarette-only users (no cigarettes in the past 30 days, urine 4-[methylnitrosamino]-1-[3-pyridyl]-1-butanol [NNAL] level <1 pg/mL of creatinine; n = 67), dual users (use of cigarettes in the past 30 days in addition to e-cigarettes, NNAL level >30 pg/mL; n = 16), and never-using controls (N = 20). Saliva was collected within 24 hours of the last e-cigarette use for analysis of cotinine and urine for analysis of NNAL and levels of 8 volatile organic chemical compounds. Bivariate analyses compared e-cigarette-only users with dual users, and regression analyses compared e-cigarette-only users with dual users and controls on levels of toxicants. RESULTS: The participants were 16.4 years old on average. Urine excretion of metabolites of benzene, ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylamide was significantly higher in dual users versus e-cigarette-only users (all P < .05). Excretion of metabolites of acrylonitrile, acrolein, propylene oxide, acrylamide, and crotonaldehyde were significantly higher in e-cigarette-only users compared with controls (all P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Although e-cigarette vapor may be less hazardous than tobacco smoke, our findings can be used to challenge the idea that e-cigarette vapor is safe, because many of the volatile organic compounds we identified are carcinogenic. Messaging to teenagers should include warnings about the potential risk from toxic exposure to carcinogenic compounds generated by these products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

E-cigarette manufacturers target children with enticing candy and fruit flavors and use marketing strategies that have been previously successful with traditional cigarettes to attract youth to these products. Numerous toxicants and carcinogens have been found in e-cigarette solutions. Nonusers are involuntarily exposed to the emissions of these devices with secondhand and thirdhand aerosol. To prevent children, adolescents, and young adults from transitioning from e-cigarettes to traditional cigarettes and minimize the potential public health harm from e-cigarette use, there is a critical need for e-cigarette regulation, legislative action, and counterpromotion to protect youth.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

New federal legislation that liberalized the Canadian e-cigarette market in May 2018, along with differences in provincial regulations, provides an opportunity to examine the impact of regulatory restrictions on e-cigarette marketing. METHODS: Repeat cross-sectional surveys of 12 004 16- to 19-year-olds in Canada, completed online in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Logistic regression models were used to examine differences over time in exposure to e-cigarette marketing and e-cigarette use, including between provinces with differing strengths of marketing restrictions.

Because many of those who use tobacco are parents and/or caregivers, children are disproportionately exposed to tobacco smoke. People who use tobacco products often become addicted to nicotine, resulting in tobacco dependence, a chronic, relapsing disease. Tobacco use and exposure are more likely to occur in vulnerable and marginalized groups, including those living in poverty. Although some view tobacco use as a personal choice, evidence suggests that structural forces play an important role in tobacco uptake, subsequent nicotine addiction, and perpetuation of use. Viewing tobacco use and tobacco dependence through a structural competency lens promotes recognition of the larger systemic forces perpetuating tobacco use, including deliberate targeting of groups by the tobacco industry, lack of enforcement of age-for-sale laws, inferior access to health insurance and health care, poor access to cessation resources, and economic stress. Each of these forces perpetuates tobacco initiation and use; in turn, tobacco use perpetuates the user's adverse health and economic conditions. Pediatricians are urged to view family tobacco use as a social determinant of health. In addition to screening adolescents for tobacco use and providing resources and treatment of tobacco dependence, pediatricians are encouraged to systematically screen children for secondhand smoke exposure and support family members who smoke with tobacco cessation.

So far at least 800 cases were confirmed as vaping-associated lung injuries (VALI) with 18 patients succumbing to the illness. To our present knowledge, vape fluids may contain certain compounds with toxic properties. It is not yet understood though what component or components are responsible for the cluster of cases. However, federal and state investigators are focusing on vape cartridges that likely contained cannabinoids as most patients vaped legal or illegal cannabinoids. Until recently, USA and UK public health authorities have welcomed vaping as a safer alternative to smoking. In countries where cannabis has been legalised, vaporizers became an increasingly popular form of administration, however, no human studies have been performed with vaporized cannabinoid oils, hence the safety of such device is unknown. A 2018 review concluded that although vaping might not necessarily be safe, it is still preferable for both patients and their environment to smoking cannabis. Since 2015, Hungarian, Australian and European scientific bodies have called for ban on the unregulated e-cigarettes, but encouraged future research to understand all aspects of vaping cannabinoids. Should vaping itself prove harmless, it might open new avenues for research and potential administration of medical cannabis, however, the contrary may cause landslide in the tobacco industry.

Morbidity and mortality weekly report,"Electronic Cigarette Use Among Working Adults - United States, 2014.","Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are battery-powered devices that deliver a heated aerosol, which typically contains nicotine, flavorings, and other additives, to the user. The e-cigarette marketplace is rapidly evolving, but the long-term health effects of these products are not known. Carcinogens and toxins such as diacetyl, acetaldehyde, and other harmful chemicals have been documented in the aerosol from some e-cigarettes (1-3). On May 5, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finalized a rule extending its authority to all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes.* The prevalence of e-cigarette use among U.S. adults has increased in recent years, particularly among current and former conventional cigarette smokers (4); in 2014, 3.7% of all U.S. adults, including 15.9% of current cigarette smokers, and 22.0% of former cigarette smokers, used e-cigarettes every day or some days (5). The extent of current e-cigarette use among U.S. working adults has not been assessed. Therefore, CDC analyzed 2014 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data for adults aged ≥18 years who were working during the week before the interview, to provide national estimates of current e-cigarette use among U.S. working adults by industry and occupation. Among the estimated 146 million working adults, 3.8% (5.5 million) were current (every day or some days) e-cigarette users; the highest prevalences were among males, non-Hispanic whites, persons aged 18-24 years, persons with annual household income <$35,000, persons with no health insurance, cigarette smokers, other combustible tobacco users, and smokeless tobacco users. By industry and occupation, workers in the accommodation and food services industry and in the food preparation and serving-related occupations had the highest prevalence of current e-cigarette use. Higher prevalences of e-cigarette use among specific groups and the effect of e-cigarette use on patterns of conventional tobacco use underscore the importance of continued surveillance of e-cigarette use among U.S. working adults to inform public health policy, planning, and practice.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Tobacco additives include flavorings, enhancers, humectants, sugars, and ammonium compounds. Although companies maintain that tobacco additives do not enhance smoke toxicity and do not make cigarettes more attractive or addictive, these claims are questioned by independent researchers. This study reviewed the studies on the effects of tobacco additives on smoke chemistry and toxicity. Tobacco additives lead to higher levels of formaldehyde and minor changes in other smoke analytes. Toxicological studies (bacterial mutagenicity and mammalian cytoxicity tests, rat 90 days inhalation studies and bone-marrow cell micronucleus assays) found that tobacco additives did not enhance smoke toxicity. Rodent assays, however, poorly predicted carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke, and were clearly underpowered to disclose small albeit toxicologically relevant differences between test (with tobacco additives) and control (without tobacco additives) cigarettes.

We used data from the Risk and Protective Factors Surveillance System for Chronic Non-Comunicable Diseases Through Telephone Interview (Vigitel), 2019 edition, which interviewed 52,443 individuals 18 years or older in Brazil's 26 state capitals and the Federal District. Point prevalence rates and confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated for current and ever use of ENDS in each state capital, and the profile of ENDS users were described. Prevalence of lifetime use was estimated at 6.7% (95%CI: 6.13-7.27) and current use at 2.32% (95%CI: 1.97-2.68). A total of 2.4 million individuals had used ENDS any time in life, and 835,000 were currently using them. Approximately 80% of persons who had used ENDS were 18 to 34 years-old. Prevalence rates for daily use and dual use in individuals aged 18 to 24 years were nearly 10 times than prevalence in the older age groups. More than half of individuals who had ever used ENDS were never smokers. The proportion of women and individuals with high educational level were higher in the group of young people who only used ENDS than among those who only smoked conventional cigarettes. ENDS users also presented a higher proportion of binge drinking. Our findings are opposite to the tobacco industry's argument that the target public for ENDS is adult smokers. Considering that groups purportedly less prone to using conventional cigarettes are experiencing initiation with ENDS, our findings call attention to the possible negative impact of the dissemination of ENDS on Brazil's successful experience in the fight against tobacco.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

These countries have the characteristic of a wide base of the pyramidal population structure, with many young people who have been natural targets for the tobacco industry. Therefore in this region there is an urgent need to establish prevention and treatment strategies capable to reduce incidence and prevalence of tobacco smoking in the population and as a consequence modify the health effects of tobacco consumption. Treating nicotine addiction requires intervention strategies really effective to reduce the number of current smokers as well as giving them tools to avoid relapse and maintain abstinence. Currently poor and vulnerable groups, which represent 44% of the total population in Latin America, are the most susceptible to suffer the health consequences of smoking since they show the highest prevalence rates and have little or no access to health services. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and MPOWER, both strategies proposed by the World Health Organization against tobacco, define clear goals to achieve their purposes, nevertheless they are limited by the economic and human resources assigned by each country. The scientific community involved in the fight against tobacco must think about new ways to place this issue in the political agenda so there will be more opportunities to increase the resources and therefore to reduce tobacco consumption in all the groups of the population. In the fight against tobacco, this is the right time to consider primarily issues related to equity and social justice.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Daily smoking promotes tumor progression, increases the risk of second cancer and decreases survival. The diagnosis of smoking and support for cessation and preventing recurrence is an integral part of cancer treatment. Smoking increases side effects of chemotherapy and surgery and reduces the effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Smokers with cancer do not smoke by life-style choice but because they are highly addicted and are suffering from a chronic relapsing disease: tobacco dependence, which justifies intensive medical management. The oncologist himself may perform this support or coordinate with other physicians in charge of the patient or with a tobacco cessation clinic, but patients are often unable to stop alone, as evidenced by the continued to use tobacco despite a cancer diagnosis. Treatment will always include a therapeutic education, compartmental behavioral therapy and medication. The patches and oral nicotine replacement or varenicline are the two most effective treatments that can be prescribed to smokers suffering of cancer, without including those with any motivation to quit. Smoking reducing occurred in a few days or weeks on treatment will allow them to reconsider the judgment. The full stop is always the goal for the doctor, even if it is not the patient initial goal. After stopping, the patient is not cured but still a patient with tobacco dependence who does not smoke. The risk of relapse in the year being 50%. The cancer patient management will use every visit to the point tobacco dependence and prevent relapse, alone or with assistance of a specialist. There is a lack of data on smoking cessation in cancer patients, but no item calls for a three-month quit rate of 50% as observed in the general population after an optimal management of tobacco cessation.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

The aetiological and clinical aspects vary according to the different tobacco production and processing steps. Contact dermatitis is frequent in tobacco harvesters, curers and cigar makers, whereas it rarely affects smokers and, only exceptionally, cigarette packaging workers. The skin sites involved also vary, according to whether the exposure is occupational or non-occupational. Tobacco contact irritation is far more frequent than contact allergy. The sensitizing compound in tobacco is unknown; nicotine, while highly toxic, does not seem to cause sensitization, except in rare cases. Besides natural substances, several compounds are added to tobacco during processing and manufacturing. For this reason, identifying the aetiological factors is exceedingly difficult. Another important aspect to take into account is the co-causative role of tobacco in eliciting or exacerbating contact dermatitis in response to other agents, occupational or extra-occupational.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In late 2022, the Australian Federal Government announced it would be ""reigniting the fight against tobacco addiction"". The forthcoming reforms package will help modernise and re-energise Australian tobacco control. The Government has signalled that preliminary reforms will include updating graphic health warnings, standardising tobacco pack sizes and filters, and banning menthol and flavours. The recently endorsed National Tobacco Strategy 2023-2030 also opens the door to further supply-side reforms. Ten years ago, when Australia fought multiple legal challenges from the tobacco industry and established plain packaging as a best practice standard, e-cigarette or vaping products were a fringe issue with little presence in Australia. Today, vaping product use by young Australians has dramatically and rapidly increased. Easy access and marketing of cheap, flavoured, disposable, nicotine-containing vaping products are driving use. Recognising that the current approach to e-cigarette regulation is not achieving its aim of preventing children and adolescents from accessing vaping products, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) launched a consultation on possible reforms in late 2022. Currently, vaping importers and retailers are exploiting an exemption for non-nicotine products in regulations, and nicotine-containing products are masquerading as non-nicotine products. The ideal public health solution would see the elimination of all vaping product sales, nicotine and non-nicotine alike, that fall outside of the TGA prescription-only access pathway. After 10 years of minimal action, it is invigorating to have three key initiatives in play to fully ""reignite"" tobacco control - the tobacco legislation renewal and update, the imminent national strategy release, and the TGA consultation on vaping products. Re-establishing Australia as a tobacco control leader is welcome news for public health.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In Canada, e-cigarettes containing nicotine have not been approved for sale; however, e-cigarettes that do not contain nicotine and do not make health claims can be sold. To date, there is little empirical evidence assessing the retail availability and marketing of e-cigarettes in countries such as Canada. METHODS: Audits were conducted at 59 brick-and-mortar retail outlets (grocery stores, convenience stores, tobacconist shops and vape shops) in four cities (Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax) in August-October 2014. In addition, a total of 21 e-cigarette manufacturer/retailer websites were audited, and inquiries were made as to whether the companies sold nicotine-containing products. RESULTS: Overall, 76% of the retail outlets sold e-cigarette products. Of convenience stores, grocery stores and tobacconist shops with e-cigarettes for sale, the vast majority (94%) sold nicotine-free products only; in contrast, all the vape shops sold at least one nicotine-containing e-cigarette product. Front counter displays were the most common form of in-store promotions and were present in virtually all convenience stores, tobacconist shops and vape shops. Nicotine-containing e-cigarettes were available for purchase at approximately half (52%) of the online e-cigarette retailers surveyed. CONCLUSION: E-cigarettes with and without nicotine are widely available and marketed at a variety of retail outlets in Canada. ""Illegal"" sales of nicotinecontaining e-cigarettes were predominantly found at vape shops and online outlets, suggesting limited compliance with existing regulations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

To circumvent the data limitations and parameter instability challenges in modeling transitions, we indirectly estimate NVPs' impact on smoking prevalence and resulting smoking-attributable deaths using the SimSmoke simulation model. METHODS: Canada SimSmoke uses age- and sex-specific data on Canadian population, smoking prevalence and tobacco control policies. The model incorporates the impact of cigarette-oriented policies on smoking prevalence but not the explicit contribution of NVPs. The model was calibrated from 1999 to 2012, thereby projecting smoking prevalence before NVPs were widely used in Canada. The NVP impact on smoking prevalence is inferred by comparing projected 2012-2020 smoking trends absent NVPs to corresponding trends from two Canadian national surveys. We further distinguish impacts before and after NVPs became regulated in 2018 and more available. RESULTS: Comparing 2012-2020 survey data of post-NVP to SimSmoke projected smoking prevalence trends, one survey indicated an NVP-related relative reduction of 15% (15%) for males (females) age 15+, but 32% (52%) for those ages 15-24. The other survey indicated a 14% (19%) NVP-related smoking reduction for ages 18+, but 42% (53%) for persons ages 18-24. Much of the gain occurred since Canada relaxed NVP restrictions. NVP-related 2012-2020 smoking reductions yielded 100,000 smoking-attributable deaths averted from 2012 to 2060. CONCLUSION: Smoking prevalence in Canada, especially among younger adults, declined more rapidly once NVPs became readily available. The emergence of NVPs into the Canadian marketplace has not slowed the decline in smoking.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Cigarette packs were collected from International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Survey (ITC) participants in the U.S., the U.K., Mauritius, Mexico, and Thailand. Cigarettes were assessed for physical and design properties (eg, ventilation, pressure drop, rod density, weight) by published methods, and for metal content (As, Cd, Ni, Pb) by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. RESULTS: Significant differences in cigarette design and toxic metal concentrations were observed between countries and between manufacturers within countries. Filter ventilation, which is strongly predictive of machine-measured tar and nicotine levels, varied most widely across countries. Ni and Cd were highest in Thailand (2.23ug/g and 1.64ug/g, respectively); As was highest in Mexico (0.29ug/g) and Pb was highest in the U.K. (0.43 ug/g).

METHODS: 23 participants stayed in a hotel that permitted smoking for 5 days and 4 nights. They were provided 2 packs of VLNC cigarettes each day (0.4 mg of nicotine/g of tobacco; Spectrum cigarettes) and did not have access to other tobacco products. 24-hour urine samples were collected to assess exposure to nicotine and anatabine. RESULTS: After 4 days of exclusive use, the geometric means for urinary total cotinine, total nicotine equivalents (TNE), and anatabine were 1.13 nmol/ml (92% reduction), 3.17 nmol/ml (94% reduction) and 0.0031 nmol/ml (93% reduction). The population estimates of the 95th percentile of cotinine, TNE, and anatabine levels were 2.69, 6.41, and 0.0099 nmol/ml, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Study participants exclusively smoking 0.4 mg/g Spectrum cigarettes are unlikely to have biomarker values above these levels.

Plasma nicotine was measured before and every 15 minutes after the first puff; subjective effects were measured before and after the session. RESULTS: Average puff duration and interpuff interval were 3.5±1.4 seconds (±SD) and 118±141 seconds, respectively. 12% of puffs were unclustered puffs while 43%, 28%, and 17% were clustered in groups of 2-5, 6-10, and >10 puffs, respectively. On average, 4.0±3.3 mg of nicotine was inhaled; the maximum plasma nicotine concentration (Cmax) was 12.8±8.5 ng/mL. Among the 8 tank users, number of puffs was positively correlated with amount of nicotine inhaled, Cmax, and area under the plasma nicotine concentration-time curve (AUC0→90min) while interpuff interval was negatively correlated with Cmax and AUC0→90. CONCLUSION: Vaping patterns differ from cigarette smoking. Plasma nicotine levels were consistent with intermittent dosing of nicotine from e-cigarettes compared to the more bolus dosing from cigarettes. Differences in delivery patterns and peak levels of nicotine achieved could influence the addictiveness of e-cigarettes compared to conventional cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: Nicotine and pH levels for 50 cigarette and 75 cigar brands were measured. Non-mentholated and mentholated cigarette products were included in the analysis along with several cigar types as identified by the manufacturer: large cigars, pipe tobacco cigars, cigarillos, mini cigarillos, and little cigars. RESULTS: There were significant differences found between pH and nicotine for cigarette and cigar tobacco products. Mean nicotine concentrations in cigarettes (19.2 mg/g) and large cigars (15.4 mg/g) were higher than the other cigars types, especially the pipe tobacco cigars (8.79 mg/g). The mean pH for cigarettes was pH 5.46. Large cigars had the highest mean pH value (pH 6.10) and pipe tobacco cigars had the lowest (pH 5.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although cigarettes are the most common combustible tobacco product used worldwide, cigar use remains popular. Our research provides a means to investigate the possibility of distinguishing the 2 tobacco product types and offers information on nicotine and pH across a wide range of cigarette and cigar varieties that may be beneficial to help establish tobacco policies and regulations across product types.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: We used Nielsen Scantrack to calculate U.S. e-cigarette sales market share from convenience and mass market channels during the 4-week period ending 1/19/13 through the period ending 12/19/15. Internet searches were used to supplement Nielsen product information. RESULTS: From 2013 to 2015, rechargeable e-cigarette brands VUSE and MarkTen experienced the largest growth in Nielsen channels. E-liquid and tank type brands Vapin Plus and Haus experienced growth although their Nielsen market share is small compared to other brands. Sales of brands with high labeled nicotine content (according to packaging or website) increased. Fruit-flavored sales increased rapidly in Nielsen, yet still represent a minority of market share in these channels. DISCUSSION: Market-leading e-cigarette brands changed substantially in Nielsen channels from 2013 to 2015. Brand leaders in these channels are now owned by tobacco companies. Changes in labelled nicotine content and fruit-flavored products and product types suggest that as e-cigarette use increases, convenience store and mass market channels are offering new products to meet consumer preferences; however, Nielsen channels do not represent the entire e-cigarette marketplace.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The enumeration and baseline characteristics of a new cohort of adult tobacco users are described. METHODS: Residents, ≥18 years of age, in urban Franklin County, or one of 6 rural Appalachian counties, and who were exclusive users of combustible, smokeless (SLT), or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) tobacco products, or were dual users, were targeted for recruitment. Participants were interviewed in-person at baseline on sociodemographic characteristics, tobacco product use, and cognitive/affective and purchasing factors. RESULTS: We recruited 1210 participants (urban, N = 595; rural, N = 615). Urban participants were less likely to use tobacco daily, began using tobacco later, used tobacco for less time, and had higher cessation interest. ENDS users were significantly less likely to have made a quit attempt than users of other tobacco products. Duration of tobacco use and nicotine dependence also differed by product type. CONCLUSION: This cohort's enumeration allowed us to compare factors associated with tobacco product preferences and the use of novel products. The inclusion of rural Appalachia-a region with high tobacco use and disease burden-may provide additional insights into the implementation of tobacco control interventions.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, all flavoured e-cigarettes, flavoured cigars larger than 6g, and alcohol flavoured cigars without filters over 1.4g were exempted. This paper examines the association between use of flavoured non-cigarette products and self-reported cigarette smoking cessation after the ban. METHODS: Current past-30 day cigarette smokers (N=913) who were 16 years or older, living in Ontario were recruited between September-December 2016 and re-contacted January-August 2018. RESULTS: Both daily and occasional pre-ban menthol cigarette smokers were more likely to use flavoured cigar products (adjusted relative rate, RR=1.53, 95% confidence interval, CI=1.01, 2.31; adjusted RR=1.57, 95% CI=1.06, 2.30) after the ban, while occasional pre-ban menthol cigarette smokers were more likely to use other tobacco products (adjusted RR=1.25, 95% CI=1.02, 1.53) or flavoured other tobacco products (adjusted RR=1.56, 95% CI=1.09, 2.24), conditional on prior use. CONCLUSIONS: Menthol smokers prior to the ban were more likely to use other tobacco products, or flavoured tobacco products, after the ban. These results suggest that comprehensive menthol bans could be more effective without the option of using flavoured tobacco or nicotine products as substitutes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: Urine samples from 51 ECIG users (collected pre/post 12-hours ECIG abstinence), and 50 controls (who do not use nicotine/tobacco) were analyzed for urine cotinine, PG, and VG concentration. RESULTS: Of 42 ECIG users with pre-abstinence urine cotinine indicating nicotine use, mean (SD) urine cotinine concentration was 1053.7 ng/ml (874.5) and for controls was 1.93 ng/ml (0.4); after abstinence, ECIG users' mean cotinine decreased to 615.4 ng/ml (753.0). For ECIG users, mean urine PG pre-abstinence was 25.6 mcg/ml (20.0) and was 9.8 mcg/ml (13.5) for controls; after abstinence, ECIG users' mean urine PG decreased to 9.7 mcg/ml (15.0; ps < .05). For ECIG users, mean urine VG pre-abstinence was 7.5 mcg/ml (7.1) and was 13.2 mcg/ml (25.0) for controls; after abstinence, ECIG users' mean VG decreased to 5.0 mcg/ml (4.4; ps < .05). CONCLUSIONS: ECIG users' mean urine PG was greater than controls and decreased after 12-hours ECIG abstinence suggesting urine PG may be useful for discriminating ECIG users from non-users and verifying short-term abstinence.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Structural equation modeling (SEM) offers a powerful solution by modeling the relationship between smoking intensity and multiple biomarkers through a latent variable. METHODS: Baseline data from a randomized trial (N = 1250) were used to estimate the relationship between smoking intensity and a latent toxicant exposure variable summarizing five volatile organic compound biomarkers. Two variables of smoking intensity were analyzed: the self-report cigarettes smoked per day and total nicotine equivalents in urine. SEM was compared with linear regression with each biomarker analyzed individually or with the sum score of the five biomarkers. RESULTS: SEM models showed strong relationships between smoking intensity and the latent toxicant exposure variable, and the relationship was stronger than its counterparts in linear regression with each biomarker analyzed separately or with the sum score. CONCLUSIONS: SEM is a powerful multivariate statistical method for studying multiple biomarkers assessing the same class of harmful constituents. This method could be used to evaluate exposure from different combusted tobacco products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

On 2 April, 2020, the Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint that the deal was anticompetitive and should be voided. This paper analyzes the deal. We find that the deal gives Altria market power in the e-cigarette market through its support of Juul in retail stores and through the agreement not to otherwise compete in the e-cigarette market. The deal also has implications for its marketing of heated tobacco product IQOS and generally may provide Altria greater control of the broader nicotine delivery product market.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, mouthpiece-based topography devices may affect natural puffing behavior. This study was designed to compare ECIG topography measured by mouthpiece-based eTop computerized device and mouthpiece-free video recordings. METHODS: ECiG-naïve cigarette smokers (N = 18) and ECIG-experienced users (N = 25) puffed on a standardized ECIG via eTop or conventionally; both sessions were videotaped. Following overnight abstinence, participants experienced one directed (10 puffs, 30 sec IPI) and 2 ad libitum puffing bouts. Heart rate and subjective response were measured throughout sessions. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences between methods were observed for topography, heart rate, or abstinence-related subjective effects, and both methods were accurate and reliable. Use of a mouthpiece was perceived to alter aspects of ECIG puffing (eg, ""reduce enjoyment). CONCLUSIONS: The mouthpiece-based eTop measures ECIG topography precisely as when no mouthpiece is used, and interferes minimally with subjective ECIG experience. Reliable and valid ECIG topography measurement methods are an important regulatory tool, as they can be used to understand the interplay between product design and user behavior to predict toxicant exposure.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: Ten cigarette smokers (8 men, 2 women) completed this within-subject study assessing effects of 2 device power settings (15 W, 45 W) and 3 liquid nicotine concentrations (0, 3, and 6 mg/ml) using a tank-style ENDS. Participants completed one directed (10 puffs) and one ad libitum use period for each condition, with blood sampled throughout. RESULTS: Plasma nicotine concentration did not increase significantly at 15 W regardless of liquid nicotine concentration. At 45 W, mean plasma nicotine increased (not significantly compared to 0 mg/ml) from 2.24 ng/ml (SD=0.2) at baseline to 3.4 ng/ml (SD=0.6) in the 3 mg/ml condition. In the 6 mg/ml, 45 W condition, mean plasma nicotine increased significantly (compared to 0 mg/ml) from 2.0 ng/ml (SD=0) at baseline to 5.96 ng/ml (SD=1.3) after 10 puffs. In general, puff duration and volume decreased as device power and nicotine concentration increased. CONCLUSIONS: Despite using a variable wattage, tank-style device, nicotine delivery was minimal. These results, when combined with results from other studies using tank-style devices, highlight ENDS performance heterogeneity. Regulation may play a role in standardizing ENDS nicotine delivery.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, there is limited research on the manifestations of stigma and discrimination among LGBTQ+ cancer survivors. METHODS: Data were collected by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services via the 2023 North Carolina LGBTQ+ Health Needs Assessment. Differences in outcomes (i.e., discrimination, violence, homelessness, mental health, substance use, and overdose) between LGBTQ+ individuals by cancer history were assessed using Chi-squared tests. Further, multivariable logit models were used to generate predicted probabilities, average marginal effects (AME), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the association of cancer with each outcome. RESULTS: A total of N = 3170 LGBTQ+ individuals (n = 200 cancer survivors) took part in the survey. In adjusted analyses, cancer history was associated with an 8.1 to 19.1 percentage point increase in the probability of all discrimination, violence, and homelessness outcomes. The largest AME of cancer was with accidental overdose (AME: 22.5; 95% CI, 15.2-29.8), followed by homelessness (AME: 19.1; 95% CI, 11.6-26.6), spouse or family violence (AME: 16.7; 95% CI, 9.3-24.1), LGBTQ+ violence (AME: 15.1; 95% CI, 7.8-22.5), sexual assault (AME: 14.1; 95% CI, 6.0-22.2), as well as nicotine product (AME: 9.0; 95%CI, 1.6-16.5) and cocaine use (AME: 8.9; 95% CI, 3.8-14.1). The most common barriers to mental health services were cost (36.0%) and health insurance (33.5%).

METHODS: Participants were first-time treatment seeking adult smokers (N=90) on a waiting list for a government-sponsored cessation program. Pearson's bivariate correlations assessed relationships between the primary outcome variable (dispositional mindfulness) and each explanatory variable (nicotine dependence, depression, anxiety, and state positive/negative affect). Linear regression analyses evaluated the unique contribution of each explanatory variable when controlling for the others. RESULTS: The sample (N=90) was predominantly female (n=71) and most (79%) had 11 or fewer years of education. In the final regression model, a total of 36.2% of the variance in dispositional mindfulness was accounted for by positive affect (B=0.81, p<0.001), negative affect (B= -0.44, p=0.02), and level of nicotine dependence (B=1.48, p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Positive and negative affect, as well as nicotine dependence, account for a significant and sizable amount of the variance in dispositional mindfulness. Future mindfulness interventions for smoking cessation should be designed to address individual differences in affect, as well as nicotine dependence, in order to better tailor treatment to address baseline differences in mindfulness.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

Results can inform tobacco policy and control efforts and the design of public education campaigns for these groups. METHODS: Five journal databases in medicine, communication, and science, were used to identify 8875 peer-reviewed, original articles in English, published in the period 2004-2018. There were 144 articles that met inclusion criteria on pro-tobacco marketing or anti-tobacco campaigns aimed at eight US groups: women of reproductive age, racial/ethnic minority groups (African American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaska Native), Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender (LGBT) populations, groups with low socioeconomic status, rural/inner city residents, military/veterans, and people with mental health or medical co-morbidities. We summarized the number of articles for each population, type of tobacco, and pro-tobacco or anti-tobacco focus. Narrative summaries were organized by population and by pro-tobacco or anti-tobacco focus, with key strategies and gaps by group. RESULTS: There were more studies on pro-tobacco marketing rather than anti-tobacco campaigns, and on cigarettes rather than other tobacco products. Major gaps included studies on Asian Americans, American Indian/Alaska Natives, pregnant women, LGBT populations, and those with mental health or medical co-morbidities. Gaps related to tobacco products were found for hookah, snus, and pipe/roll-your-own tobacco in the pro-tobacco studies, and for all products except cigarettes in anti-tobacco studies. Common tobacco industry methods used were tailoring of product and package design and messages that were used to reach and appeal to different sociodemographic groups. Studies varied by research design making it difficult to compare results. CONCLUSIONS: We found major research gaps for specific groups and tobacco products.

Non-smokers may also start using IQOS if they believe this product is less harmful than other nicotine products. Smokers' and non-smokers' decisions may be driven by relative harm perceptions of emerging nicotine products. We aimed to examine relative harm perceptions between IQOS, e-cigarettes, and cigarettes, among nicotine product users and non-users. METHODS: We conducted a web survey with Canadian respondents (aged ≥20 years; n=268) in September-October 2018. Perceptions about relative harm between IQOS (available for sale since 2017 and subject to the same comprehensive marketing restrictions as cigarettes in Canada), e-cigarettes, and cigarettes, were assessed among non-users (n=79), exclusive smokers (n=78), exclusive e-cigarette users (n=32), and dual users (n=79). Multiple logistic regression explored the association between relative harm perceptions and nicotine-use status, adjusting for sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Over half of respondents perceived IQOS as equally or more harmful than e-cigarettes (53.7%), while almost a quarter either reported IQOS as less harmful than e-cigarettes or were uncertain (22.7% and 23.5%, respectively). Two-thirds of respondents (65.7%) perceived e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes, yet only half (48.1%) perceived IQOS as less harmful than cigarettes. Both exclusive and dual e-cigarette users, but not exclusive smokers, had higher odds of perceiving IQOS as more harmful than e-cigarettes and less harmful than cigarettes compared to non-users. CONCLUSIONS: Most nicotine users and non-users perceive differential health risk across IQOS, e-cigarettes, and cigarettes. Although e-cigarettes are generally viewed as less harmful than cigarettes, the perceived harm of IQOS was unclear.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study aimed to examine the perceived risks of tobacco use on COVID-19 infection and severity, and possible COVID-related changes in perceptions of tobacco use and overall health. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of adults in the United States in June 2020 (n=2097). The survey covered cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, and hookah. We also assessed changes in the use of any of the four tobacco products. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of agreeing with the perceived risks for each risk and each product, with the adjustment of demographic and COVID-19 related variables. RESULTS: For all four tobacco products, the perceived risks to general health were slightly higher during the pandemic than before the pandemic (77% vs 79.5% for cigarettes) and the perceived risk of COVID-19 severity was larger than the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection (73.3% vs 56.2% for cigarettes). All risk measures varied with tobacco products consistently, with the risks highest for cigarettes, then cigars, followed by e-cigarettes and hookah. Females and people with higher income or education were more likely to endorse the risks of tobacco use than their counterparts. People who perceived higher risks of using cigarettes (OR=1.65; 95% CI: 1.20-2.27) and cigars (OR=1.63; 95% CI: 1.17-2.27) to COVID-19 severity were more likely to have decreased or quit their use. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco/nicotine use was perceived to increase the risk of COVID-19 severity and the perceived risk of tobacco/nicotine use to general health was high during the pandemic, particularly for cigarettes. The change of perceived risks appeared to be prompting harm-reducing changes in tobacco product use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We systematically analyzed content and themes of TikTok posts tagged #nicotineaddiction. METHODS: We conducted a quantitative content analysis of the visual and textual content of the 149 top-viewed English-language TikTok posts tagged #nicotineaddiction as of 1 March 2021. Posts were double-coded using a shared codebook, noting content creator characteristics, nicotine products featured, references to quitting, and overall themes of #nicotineaddiction expressed. We assessed the prevalence of post characteristics and themes overall and by apparent age of content creators (aged ≥21 years versus <21 years). RESULTS: The 149 posts analyzed received a mean and median of 62433 and 15800 likes, respectively. E-cigarettes were referenced or featured in 75% of posts; 58% featured a specific nicotine product brand, most commonly Puff Bar (23% of total) and JUUL (19%). Overall, 22% of posts mentioned quitting nicotine. The top themes of #nicotineaddiction expressed were physical or psychological consequences (e.g. withdrawal symptoms, 46%), physical or psychological benefits (e.g. tasting good, feeling 'buzzed', 28%), and social benefits (e.g. bonding with fellow users, 28%). Compared to those aged ≥21 years, posts by content creators likely <21 years (26%) less commonly mentioned quitting (p<0.01), had fewer followers (p<0.01), were more commonly from Canada (p<0.01) and less commonly from the US (p<0.01), and more commonly featured JUUL (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: While reaching a large and engaged audience, TikTok content creators suggest a range of benefits and consequences of nicotine addiction. Future research is warranted to examine this content's potential to influence young people's intentions to use or quit nicotine products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

METHODS: This study examined transition outcomes among tobacco users and factors associated with future JUUL use. Convenience sample data were collected from adult tobacco users in South Korea, from March-April 2019 (baseline, n=2173) to September 2019 (follow-up, n=779). Results were obtained from the 779 respondents in the follow-up survey, and user data of one or more tobacco products were analyzed. The changes in the proportion of EC and JUUL use during this period were calculated, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the selection factors of JUUL. RESULTS: Four months after the JUUL launch, the proportion of current EC and JUUL users among the whole sample increased by 10.3% (42.6-52.9%, p<0.001) and 17.7 % (4.0-21.7%, p<0.001), respectively, while the proportion of triple users doubled (18.7% vs 37.5%, p<0.001). Among current EC users, the percentage of quitting EC within one month decreased from 18.7% to 8.7%; this change was more pronounced among concurrent JUUL users than non-JUUL users (p<0.001). In the multivariate logistic analysis with adjustment for possible confounders, JUUL use was significantly associated with male sex, young and middle age, and metropolitan residency status at the baseline survey. CONCLUSIONS: After the launch of JUUL in South Korea, EC users, including JUUL and triple users, increased significantly, but the intention to stop EC decreased significantly. Given the serious interests of the tobacco industry in these products, additional regulation is warranted.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study investigated the general trends and maintenance of ENDS flavor use for youth (aged 12-17 years), young adults (aged 18-24 years), and older adults (aged ≥25 years) between 2014 and 2019. METHODS: Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study Wave 2 (2014-2015), Wave 3 (2015-2016), Wave 4 (2016-2017), and Wave 5 (2018-2019) youth and adult data were used. Cross-sectional flavor use prevalence (trends) and flavor maintenance (using the same flavor category in at least three consecutive waves) were assessed. RESULTS: The most reported primary flavor category was fruit among all age groups in all waves. Candy/desserts in waves two, three, four, and menthol/mint in wave five were the second most reported flavor in all age groups. The highest increase was observed for menthol/mint use among youth between wave two (21.9%) and five (58.1%) (OR=5.33; 95% CI: 3.58-7.96). Overall, 37.6% of fruit flavor users, 25.3% of candy/desserts users, 32.0% of menthol/mint users, and 33.4% of tobacco flavor users, maintained use of the same flavor in at least three consecutive waves. CONCLUSIONS: Fruit flavor had the highest percentages of use and maintenance between 2014 and 2019. While the maintenance of fruit and candy/desserts flavors were higher among youth, adults had substantially higher maintenance percentages for menthol/mint and tobacco flavor. There was a substantial increase in menthol/mint use in wave five among youth, which may affect ENDS flavor maintenance patterns in the future. Understanding maintenance of flavors over time can inform regulation of ENDS flavors.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The aim of the study was to analyze the smoker narrative using two types of methodologies: content analysis and grounded theory, before and after smoking cessation intervention, provided to the smoker in a specialized Smoking Cessation Unit accredited by the Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery. METHODS: A prospective observational study of current smokers included in a tobacco cessation program between 2017 and 2020 was conducted at the Smoking Cessation Unit of Santiago de Compostela Health Area, Spain. Routine clinical variables and patient narrative data were collected. A descriptive analysis of the sample, the content of the textual corpus, and a grounded theory were performed in semi-structured interviews at baseline and at follow-up at 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were included (mean age 55.6 ± 10.6 years; 56.9% male; mean nicotine dependence score 5.7 ± 1.6). Quantitative analysis of the narrative shows that the most frequent phrases and words are associated with smoking, nicotine craving, and predisposition for smoking cessation. After the intervention, phrases related to the manifestation of abstinence, response to pharmacological treatment, and self-perception of smoking cessation were predominant. In the qualitative analysis, the most frequent categories in the smoker's textual corpus were dependence, motivation, and emotionality, which decreased after the intervention (11.4%, 21.4%, and 9.9%, respectively) accompanied by increased satisfaction (19.2%) and the manifestation of abstinence (21.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Motivation, nicotine dependence, and sensitivity to emotions are all closely intertwined in the current smoker narrative and can be modified as a consequence of treatment.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

We examined the unique devices and liquids used among US adults frequently using ENDS before, during, and after a majority of PMTA decisions were made. METHODS: Data are from waves 1-5 (W1: May-Oct 2020, n=1179; W5: Feb-Apr 2023, n=1290) of a longitudinal survey of US adults (≥21 years) using ENDS ≥5 days/week. User-submitted photos of participants' most used devices and liquids were coded. Descriptive analyses and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to understand the number and types of unique devices and liquids used in W1-W5, and the top brands in each wave. RESULTS: From W1-W5, the number of unique ENDS device models and liquid products used by participants increased from 279 to 357 (p<0.001) and 546 to 695 (p<0.001), respectively. More unique devices in W5 versus W1 were disposable (W1: 16.5%; W5: 36.1%); fewer were disposable pod (W1: 6.5%; W5: 3.1%) or tank (W1: 53.8%; W5: 30.8%) devices. Liquids were primarily sweet-flavored (W1: 81.1%; W5: 82.0%). The median liquid nicotine concentration increased from 12 to 50 mg/mL. In W5, few participants used FDA-approved devices (n=17; 1.3%) or liquids (n=6; 0.5%), and Elf Bar was the most commonly used device and liquid brand. Results for all waves are reported. CONCLUSIONS: Despite PMTA decisions, an increase in the number of unique device models and liquid products used among adults who frequently use ENDS was observed from 2020 to 2023. Few participants in 2023 were using FDA-approved devices or liquids. Further research and monitoring are needed to inform how FDA prioritizes enforcement actions and what types of enforcement actions are effective.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

These are often referred to as 'concept flavors'. This article presents a sample of ENDS concept flavor names to identify naming conventions the industry uses. METHODS: We reviewed 4546 English-language ENDS advertisements that ran in a variety of outlets including magazines, TV, radio, and direct-to-consumer emails, during the period 2015-2020. ENDS flavors in ads were identified and classified as 'concept' if the name contained no explicit characterizing flavor information. All concept flavor names were then reviewed by two coders to identify themes and practices used by ENDS manufacturers. RESULTS: The sample identified 215 unique concept flavor names. We found examples of flavor names that were suggestive of food or drink such as 'Citra Zing', as well as flavor names suggestive of sensations associated with drug use, such as 'Blurred Vision'. Some other concept flavor themes identified included the use of colors ('Red Venom'), numbers ('No 42.'), words associated with mythology ('God Nectar'), tropical imagery (Hawaiian Rainbow), and pop culture ('Miami Vice'). Some naming practices included the creation of flavor names using a portmanteau ('Grappleberry'), flavor names that used intentional misspelling or satiric misspelling, ('Gritz', and 'Cap'n Crunk'), and the use of malapropisms ('ohm sweet ohm'). CONCLUSIONS: The tobacco industry uses concept flavor names, and these names are presented in advertising in the US. This article identified themes and naming practices for concept flavors. Future work may continue to monitor the use of concept flavors and if concept flavor names are used in response to flavor restrictions. Additionally, future research may explore if concept flavors themes are associated with perceived risk, use intentions and behavior.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The aim of this study is to investigate the perceptions of tobacco control stakeholders in Africa on their agreement with what endgame approaches are suited for the region to achieve a tobacco-free society. METHODS: Data were collected using a web-based cross-sectional survey hosted on Redcap. A total of 146 stakeholders from 28 African countries took the survey. Participants rated agreement with 11 proposed endgame approaches drawn from the literature and the qualitative phase of this study. Descriptive analysis was used to summarize stakeholders' level of agreement while bivariate (chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests) and adjusted modified Poisson regression analyses examined association between agreement/disagreement to endgame approaches and demographic factors. Data were analyzed using STATA v17. RESULTS: All participants agreed to an integrated endgame approach while over 90% agreed with six measures (having non-addictive cigarettes, making cigarette unappealing, tobacco-free generation, regulated market model, quota/sinking lid and specific approaches for Africa). Agreements ranged from 70-85% for price caps, performance-based regulation, and non-combustible nicotine products, while only 35% supported government takeover of tobacco companies. Adjusted Poisson regression analyses showed that female stakeholders were less likely to support restricting tobacco sales by year of birth (relative risk ratio, RRR=0.89) and price caps (RRR=0.78), while PhD holders were more likely to support restricting tobacco sales by year of birth (RRR=1.29) and price caps (RRR=1.27). Stakeholders from Southern Africa were less likely to support a state takeover of tobacco companies (RRR=0.40) and performance-based regulation (RRR=0.76). Having more than 20 years of tobacco control experience lowered the support of price caps endgame measures (RRR=0.45). CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers are encouraged to use insights from this study to consider multifaceted approaches aimed at addressing the problem of commercial tobacco in the African region and pave the way for a tobacco-free Africa.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In addition, we introduce the social phenomena that occur as a result of an increase in tobacco tax, and propose effective strategies and principles that need to be taken into account before increasing cigarette prices. METHODS: We compared changes to smoking rates before and after the increase in cigarette prices. To investigate the changes that occurred before South Korea's increase in tobacco tax, we first analysed the state of cigarette consumption and then the change in smoking rates. RESULTS: The increase in cigarette prices caused an immediate backlash from smokers, particularly low-income groups and those claiming tax inequality. In particular, the sales of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) increased dramatically and the lower price marketing of tobacco companies led to short-term market share increases. As expected, smoking rates in South Korea decreased. However, because the price increase was not sufficient to encourage widespread smoking cessation, the decrease in smoking rates was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Because the primary objective of the cigarette pricing policy was not designed to promote public health, by reducing smoking rates, it received public criticism. To avoid public criticism, the government must emphasize and convince the public that the primary objective of increasing cigarette prices is to protect public health through a decline in smoking rates. Ideally, health authorities should play a leading role in formulating tobacco tax policy.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The current study aims to assess a tobacco company's use of novel marketing strategies and intent to promote snus in the US as either a replacement or situational substitute for the cigarette. METHODS: A Boolean search string was used to search R. J. Reynolds' (RJR) Records in UCSF's Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library. A total of 358 documents, from 2005-2009, met our initial search criteria and were selected for their relevance to the marketing of Camel Snus. A content analysis was subsequently conducted using the Framework Method to identify themes and strategies for promoting Camel Snus. RESULTS: Four major themes about Camel Snus emerged from the documents: 1) promotion by third parties including retailers, snus ambassadors and secret shoppers, 2) expansion of the target population of SLT users to include female smokers and dual users of cigarettes and SLT, 3) emphasis on the difference between Camel Snus and other SLT, and 4) a shift from promoting the practical uses of Camel Snus to using emotional messages conveying freedom. CONCLUSIONS: The findings align with other studies suggesting that RJR intended to market snus to non-users of SLT. The findings also reveal that RJR employed creative marketing strategies (e.g. snus ambassadors) and may have intended to promote snus as a situational substitute for the cigarette, as evidenced by the company's recruitment of dual tobacco users.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

To date, three cohorts of Korean respondents have participated in the larger ITC Korea Project (cohort 1: 2005-2014, cohort 2: 2016, and cohort 3: 2020-present). The overall objectives of the ITC KRA1 Survey were to examine the use of cigarettes, heated tobacco products (HTPs), e-cigarettes (ECs); whether HTPs might help smokers quit; and the effectiveness of tobacco control policies, such as large graphic warnings, high cigarette taxes, and smoking bans in public places. The KRA1 Survey measures were identical or functionally similar to those of the ITC Japan Survey and, to a lesser extent, those of other ITC countries. Key measures assessed sociodemographic characteristics of respondents; the use of combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and heated tobacco products; and measures assessing policies of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, including price and tax (Article 6), smoke-free laws (Article 8), health warnings (Article 11), education, communication and public awareness (Article 12), advertising, promotion, and sponsorship restrictions (Article 13), and support for cessation (Article 14). Adult tobacco and/or nicotine users aged ≥19 years in South Korea were recruited by a commercial survey firm from its online panel. Overall, 4794 respondents completed the KRA1 Survey. The cooperation rate was 97.4% and the response rate was 15.2%. The cohort design permits assessment of transitions in products used among users in South Korea and evaluations of the impact of policies on tobacco and/or nicotine products used and transitions in use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

A consortium of 12 international tobacco companies submitted 14 reports that were reviewed by an independent scientific body within the Joint Action on Tobacco Control (JATC). The reports were evaluated in accordance with the TPD with regard to their comprehensiveness, methodology and conclusions. Here we present their significant identified methodological limitations. The toxicological and chemical evaluation in the industry reports was mainly based on comparative testing, which lacks discriminative power for products with high toxicity and variability, like cigarettes. The literature reviews were biased, the comparative chemical studies did not assess previously identified pyrolysis products, the toxicological evaluation did not include the assessment of inhalation toxicity, and pyrolysis products were not assessed in terms of toxicity, including their genotoxic and carcinogenic potential. For both chemistry and toxicity testing, the statistical approach applied to test the difference between test and additive-free control cigarettes resulted in a high chance of false negatives. The clinical study for inhalation facilitation and nicotine uptake had limitations concerning study design and statistical analysis, while addictiveness was not assessed. Finally, the methodology used to assess characterizing flavors was flawed. In conclusion, there are significant limitations in the methodology applied by the industry. Therefore, the provided reports are of insufficient quality and are clearly not suitable to decide whether a priority additive should be banned in tobacco products according to the TPD.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study examined young adults' nicotine pouch awareness, use, use intentions, and related factors. METHODS: We analyzed Spring 2022 survey data from 942 young adults recruited via social media from six US cities (mean age=27.61 years, 34.3% men, 33.1% racial/ethnic minority) to characterize nicotine pouch awareness, ever use, use intentions, exposure, and perceptions. RESULTS: Nicotine pouch awareness and ever use were reported by 34.6% and 9.8%, respectively. Males (AOR=1.79; 95% CI: 1.33-2.38), non-White participants (vs White; AOR=1.64; 95% CI: 1.04-2.61), and those using cigarettes (AOR=2.67; 95% CI: 1.63-4.38), e-cigarettes (AOR=2.28; 95% CI: 1.57-3.31), and smokeless tobacco (SLT) (AOR=14.46; 95% CI: 1.81-115.61) had greater odds of awareness. Among those aware of nicotine pouches, males (AOR=2.27; 95% CI: 1.33-3.85), White participants (vs Asian; AOR=0.40; 95% CI: 0.17-0.94), and SLT users (AOR=4.90; 95% CI: 1.26-18.98) had greater odds of ever use; being male (B=0.39; 95% CI: -0.67 - -0.12) and using SLT (B=1.73; 95% CI: 1.10-2.36) predicted greater use intentions. Overall, 31.4% reported past-month advertising exposure, most often via tobacco retailers (67.3%). Ever users most commonly purchased them at gas stations (46.7%). The most frequently reported use motives were to quit combusted tobacco (16.8%) and reduce tobacco smell (15.4%). Nicotine pouches were perceived as less harmful and less addictive than cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and SLT, and more socially acceptable than cigarettes and SLT. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults were exposed to advertising, accessed nicotine pouches via various sources, and perceived these products favorably. Marketing and use surveillance is needed to monitor their impact on those likely to use them (e.g. males, SLT users).","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Historically, the tobacco industry has exploited loopholes in the Tobacco Control Act (TCA), especially related to the definitions of nicotine, tobacco product and characterizing flavors, to circumvent the PMTA requirement. In 2023, the industry introduced several 'PMTA-exempt' e-cigarette and smokeless products, including products containing 6-methyl nicotine, a synthetic nicotine analog that is pharmacologically more potent than nicotine. In late 2023 and early 2024, the major US e-cigarette suppliers Nicotine River and ECBlend introduced 'PMTA-exempt' products with the brand names 'Nixamide' or 'Nixodine' or 'Nixotine', with nicotinamide as the main active ingredient. Nicotinamide is a form of vitamin B3 with no known pharmacological activity at nicotinic receptors. Here, we report that the marketing claims for these products, suggesting them and be nicotine substitute products designed to target nicotinic receptors and provide the same experience as nicotine, is deceptive and misleading to consumers. We also inform that these products have evolved further to contain a combination of nicotinamide and 6-methyl nicotine. The regulatory implications of these newly introduced products are discussed.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study examines whether the primary reason for continued ENDS usage changes over time, and its association with device and liquid characteristics. METHODS: Data are from a longitudinal cohort study and include 526 US adults (≥21 years) using ENDS frequently (≥5 days/week) as self-reported, and uploaded photos of their most used ENDS devices and liquids and self-reported primary reason for continued ENDS usage in wave 2 (December 2020-April 2021) and wave 5 (February-April 2023). Device-liquid grouping was defined by device (disposable/disposable pod/refillable pod/tank, adjustable/no adjustable settings) and liquid (salt/freebase) characteristics. A device was classified as having adjustable settings if it allowed users to modify the power, coil, or airflow. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regressions and McNemar tests. RESULTS: From wave 2 to 5, the primary reason for continued ENDS usage significantly changed, with more participants reporting addiction (29.2% vs 34.6%, p<0.001); and significantly more participants used disposable devices (salt, no adjustable settings) (7.9% vs 25.2%, p<0.001). Compared to those using tanks (freebase, adjustable settings), participants using devices with nicotine salt liquids were more likely to report addiction (AOR>2; 95% CI: 1.12-8.19); and participants using disposable devices (salt, no adjustable settings) were less likely to report quitting/reducing smoking as the primary ENDS use reason after controlling for smoking status and sociodemographic characteristics (AOR<0.6; 95% CI: 0.14-0.995). CONCLUSIONS: Over a 2.5-year period, the proportion of participants continuing to use ENDS at least 5 days/week because of addiction grew, and participants' motivations varied by device-liquid grouping. Restrictions on nicotine salts may disproportionately impact those using ENDS because of addiction; and regulations targeting tanks with freebase liquids may disproportionately impact those using ENDS for smoking cessation/reduction.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Despite the well-formulated tobacco control interventions defined by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) in place, smoking prevalence in 2019 was high (27%) and has not decreased since 2014. Therefore, greater emphasis should be placed on addressing and treating smokers. This narrative review summarizes the progress in smoking cessation support in Hungary to identify strengths and areas for improvement. A literature search was conducted in the Hungarian Arcanum Digital Science Library. After 2012, data were derived from the National Methodology Center for Cessation Support reports. The National Korányi Institute for Pulmonology established the first organized network of cessation counselling services in 1987 in outpatient pulmonary clinics (OPCs) sponsored by a State Insurance tender. By 1999, individual behavioral counselling with medication was accessible to 130 healthcare providers, due to the support of pharmaceutical companies. Since 2005, the National Health Insurance Fund has financed smoking cessation support in OPCs, albeit at a low value. Having recognized that OPCs are overburdened by the organizational tasks of cessation support and that funding is intermittent, from 2020, the counselling service has transferred to the existing network of health promotion offices, although without specific funding for cessation programs and communication. Adequate and regular funding for established counselling services and nicotine withdrawal treatment is essential to achieve progress in tobacco control. The role of healthcare professionals is outstanding; therefore, individual responsibilities should be recognized.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

There is a need to identify challenges and opportunities for advancing SAFE policies and their implementation. This study aims to identify barriers and opportunities to extend, enforce, and comply with SAFE policies in Europe. METHODS: Within the Joint Action on Tobacco Control 2, a cross-sectional expert consultation was launched in 2022. Data obtained through an online questionnaire including closed and open-ended questions on barriers, opportunities, and interference by the tobacco and/or nicotine industry (TNI) on the extension, and compliance with/enforcement of SAFE policies, were analyzed thematically and descriptively. RESULTS: From 29 European countries, 61 experts (response rate: 55.5%) were included in our sample. The most commonly identified barriers for the extension of SAFE policies were tobacco industry lobbying and funding activities, while the most commonly reported opportunity was extending SAFE policies to specific outdoor public or private places, especially where children are present. In terms of compliance with/enforcement of SAFE policies, the lack of human and financial resources and capacity to monitor/enforce compliance were the most commonly identified barriers, while opportunities included more powerful enforcement authorities with increased capacity. The experts identified greater TNI interference on the extension than on the enforcement of SAFE policies. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive regulation of TNI interference and allocation of human/financial resources for policy enforcement, should be a priority for the extension of SAFE policies in Europe.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

It is unknown whether the use of 6MN has spread to other product categories. Industry reports, patent and trademark databases were searched for 6-methyl nicotine products. Identified trademarks 'Metatine', 'Nixotine', 'Imotine' were used to search for US-marketed products. Ingredient information was compared to US market-leading products, and safety warnings and regulatory statements were assessed in context with US state and federal regulations. Two US-based oral pouch brands, 'MG' and 'Hippotine' pouches, were identified in August 2024, advertised to contain 'Imotine'-trademarked 6MN. MG Pouches are marketed in four flavors, and 'Hippotine'-branded pouches are marketed in two flavors, likely representing banned flavor characterization in US state jurisdictions such as California. 6MN contents range 8-25 mg. Otherwise, the ingredient lists were almost identical across both product lines. Products list extensive addiction and health warnings, including warnings not to operate vehicles. Vendors state that these are not tobacco products, which implies that federal and state tobacco regulations do not apply. The spread of nicotine analogs to additional product categories, such as oral pouches, is concerning, especially given the high declared 6MN contents exceeding nicotine in popular US-marketed oral nicotine pouch products. Legislators and regulators need to provide certainty about the regulatory status of nicotine analogs to prevent further erosion of tobacco flavor bans and other regulations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The study assesses Ukraine's efforts across three pillars: 1) surveillance, 2) legislation and public health gains, and 3) adherence to the WHO FCTC Article 5.3. Despite war-related disruptions and a humanitarian crisis, Ukraine has upheld and strengthened policies like tobacco taxation, new pictorial health warnings on cigarette packs, advertising bans, and smoking restrictions, largely due to strong policy leadership and international collaborations driven by the European Union integration. Successes and political leadership over the past decade have reinforced Ukraine's compliance with the WHO FCTC. However, continued threats from the tobacco industry, especially efforts to weaken legislation and obstruct enforcement of regulations on new and emerging nicotine and tobacco products, remain a serious concern. This analysis underscores the vital role of a resilient public health infrastructure and sustained international support in protecting tobacco control progress, particularly during times of crisis.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The Joint Action on Tobacco Control 2 (JATC2) aims to identify TAPS gaps in the current European Union (EU) regulations and to provide comprehensive recommendations for updating them. METHODS: An online consultation with European TAPS national experts was conducted in 2023. Seventy-seven experts from 27 European countries were contacted and 38 experts from 21 countries participated in the consultation. RESULTS: Significant gaps in current TAPS regulations were identified, particularly in entertainment, online media and points of sale. Citizens are not adequately protected from TAPS, the tobacco industry extensively uses loopholes to circumvent regulations. TAPS-related issues currently affect tobacco and particularly non-therapeutic nicotine products, devices, accessories, products imitations and all marketing channels, entertainment, online media and especially, social networks. To address these challenges, regulations should include bans on internet sales and TAPS at points of sale, licensing, decreased retail availability, plain packaging and ban on corporate social responsibility actions, corporate promotion and 'brand stretching'. These measures should be accompanied by effective monitoring and enforcement, dissuasive sanctions, formalized collaboration among countries and international collaboration, civil society involvement, strong public education, and community awareness programs. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to address the current gaps in the EU TAPS regulations through comprehensive and harmonized TAPS bans across all EU countries. Updated regulations must anticipate emerging industry strategies and new products, ensuring continuous adaptation to counteract them effectively.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study examines trends in tobacco-related attitudes, education, and media exposure among Polish youth, using data from the 2022 GYTS alongside previous surveys conducted in 2003 and 2016. METHODS: The study sample was stratified by geographical regions: rural areas, small towns, and large cities. Data were collected from 98 schools across Poland, involving 95 schools (96.9%), 224 classes (97.8%), and 3985 students (78.9%). The primary analysis focused on 3573 students aged 13-15 years. Data from 2003 and 2016 GYTS editions were also used for comparison. Sampling, data weighting, and the methodological framework followed WHO guidelines. RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2022, there was a notable decline in the proportion of Polish adolescents receiving tobacco education in school, from 61.4% to 43.1%. Perceptions of the harms of secondhand smoke also fell substantially, from 65.8% to 34.4%. Support for smoke-free policies weakened, with a decline in support for both indoor and outdoor smoking bans. Exposure to anti-tobacco messages in media dropped dramatically, from 89.4% in 2003 to 34.9% in 2022. On the other hand, perceptions that smoking enhances social interactions rose from 40.8% to 45.5%, while tobacco industry advertising and depictions of tobacco use in media remained prevalent, though declining over time. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest concerning trends in tobacco-related attitudes and behaviors among Polish adolescents, indicating weakened prevention efforts and a shift towards pro-tobacco norms. The decline in tobacco education, public support for smoke-free policies, and media exposure to anti-tobacco messages highlight the need for renewed public health interventions. Strengthening school-based education, reinforcing smoke-free policies, and regulating tobacco portrayals in media are critical to reversing these trends. Additionally, policy measures such as plain packaging and a ban on tobacco displays at points of sale are necessary to protect future generations from tobacco initiation. Without decisive action, there is a risk of undermining the progress made in tobacco control.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In recent years, electronic cigarettes have gained popularity as seemingly safer alternatives to conventional cigarettes; however, their impact on tumor biology remains controversial. A central process in lung cancer progression is the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which promotes cellular invasion, migration, and therapy resistance. This review summarizes current evidence on how nicotine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), carbonyl compounds, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulate EMT through key signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and HIF-1α. Moreover, it discusses the role of thermal processes during tobacco combustion and e-liquid heating in generating carcinogenic by-products. Emerging data indicate that both traditional and electronic cigarettes release bioactive agents capable of inducing EMT, thereby contributing to lung cancer pathogenesis and revealing potential therapeutic targets.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Pharmacists can assist smokers seeking to quit by offering counseling on smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. Pragmatic randomized trials are useful for investigating practical questions about an intervention's risks, benefits, and costs in routine clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an enhanced pharmacy care (EPC) program involving personalized pharmacist-provided telephone counseling for supporting prescription smoking cessation medications compared with usual care (UC). METHODS: Cigarette smokers filling a newly prescribed smoking cessation pharmacotherapy and with pharmacy benefits managed by Express Scripts were recruited. Qualified subjects were randomized 1:1 to EPC and UC. Subjects in EPC received 3 telephone-counseling sessions from specialist pharmacists during the early course of the study, while subjects in UC did not receive any counseling sessions. Study outcomes were collected through telephone contact and using the Express Scripts prescription database. The primary outcome assessed the 1-week point prevalence (PP) of smoking abstinence at the end of the trial (week 12). Secondary outcomes included 4-week PP at week 12 and adherence, evaluated by proportion of days covered (PDC), to prescribed smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. RESULTS: There were 1,017 randomized subjects. Among them, 1,002 subjects were included in the analysis, and 513 were randomized into EPC and 489 into UC. Baseline demographics, smoking history, and prescribed smoking cessation pharmacotherapies were comparable. Varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) were most frequently prescribed for smoking cessation. In EPC, 46.0% received all 3 counseling sessions; 29.4% received 2 sessions; and 14.6% received 1 session. Overall, 353 subjects in EPC and 383 subjects in UC completed the week 12 assessment. In the analysis for 1-week PP of smoking abstinence at week 12, the percentage of abstainers in EPC was numerically higher than in UC (42.3% vs. 38.2%) with OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.96-1.61. It was not statistically significant. Adherence to prescription smoking cessation medication was significantly higher in EPC versus UC (49.7% vs. 45.6%; P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated whether a telephone-based pharmacy care program, provided by pharmacists and designed to support attempted quitters, improved quitting and increased adherence over usual care. The findings suggest that an enhanced program may benefit smokers by increasing prescription smoking cessation medication adherence. Future research should explore this program's effect on smokers who are compliant, based on insights on quitting provided by the post hoc analyses and limitations of the current study design.

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of smoking cessation drugs (nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline) used either in isolation or in combination in adults under and over 60 years of age. METHODS: Data were collected from 940 Brazilian patients participating in a smoking cessation program. Participants were prescribed smoking cessation medication to be used for at least 12 weeks and were followed for 52 weeks. RESULTS: Cessation rates were significantly different among younger and older participants who were using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) alone. Being over 60 years of age was significantly associated with increased cessation success among those who used NRT alone (OR 2.34, 95% CI: 1.36 to 4.04, p = 0.002). The effectiveness of varenicline and bupropion were not significantly different according to age groups. CONCLUSION: Using age as a predictor for tailoring smoking cessation drugs might potentially lead to a more individualized prescription of smoking cessation therapy. These results should be tested in randomized controlled trials.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Medicines are recommended for all smokers who are motivated to quit and are nicotine dependent. Combination nicotine replacement therapy with a patch and an oral product is more effective than the patch alone. An adequate dose of nicotine must be used for an adequate duration. Varenicline is the most effective oral drug. It is safe in people with stable mental illness.

An overview of selected biomarkers of tobacco exposure in individuals includes exhaled carbon monoxide, cotinine (the proximate metabolite of nicotine), and measurement of an individual's puffing pattern termed smoking topography. Common tobacco contents discussed include tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) some of which increase disease risk including cancer. Exemplars of additives to cigarettes by the tobacco industry will be described including menthol, one additive marketed by the industry. Genetics and tobacco addiction has emerged as a rapidly expanding field. Illustrative of this area are twin studies, nicotinic receptors, CYP2A6 polymorphisms, and genes that impact dopamine receptors. The cadre of nurse scientists conducting research in this much needed area is small. The opportunity for nurse scientists educated in biological inquiry in tobacco-related research is great. Nurse scientists actively involved in multidisciplinary translational teams to address nicotine addition are needed.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Studies included determination of the octanol-water partition coefficient, conversion to CO2 in soil and activated sludge, and evaluation of the effects on microbiological and algal inhibition as well as plant germination and root elongation. The partitioning of nicotine between octanol and water indicated that nicotine will not bioaccumulate regardless of the pH of the medium. The aqueous and soil-based biodegradation studies indicated that nicotine is readily biodegradable in both types of media. The microbiological inhibition and aquatic and terrestrial toxicity tests indicated that nicotine has low toxicity. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Persistence, Bioaccumulation, and Toxicity Profiler model, based on the structure of nicotine and the predictive rates of hydroxyl radical and ozone reactions, estimated an atmospheric half-life of less than 5.0 h. Using this value in the Canadian Environmental Modeling Center level III model, the half-life of nicotine was estimated as 3.0 d in water and 0.5 d in soil. This model also estimated nicotine discharge into the environment; nicotine would be expected to be found predominantly in water (93%), followed by soil (4%), air (3%), and sediment (0.4%). Using the estimated nicotine concentrations in water, soil, and sediment and the proper median effective concentrations derived from the algal growth, biomass inhibition, and buttercrunch lettuce (Lactuca sativa) seed germination and root elongation studies, hazard quotients of between 10(-7) and 10(-8) were calculated, providing further support for the conclusion that the potential for nicotine toxicity to aquatic and terrestrial species in the environment is extremely low.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study highlights several examples of actions by transnational tobacco corporations to obscure those effects, including several in which they were aided by the oral health community. METHODS: Information was derived primarily from a search of records in the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Database, supplemented by other published material and the author's personal experiences. RESULTS: Tobacco companies attempted to interfere with oral cancer research and dissemination of its findings the 1950s and 1960s. Philip Morris, Inc. partnered with the American Dental Association's periodontal research centre until 1973 and the Council for Tobacco Research supported its dental student research program until 1972. Swedish Match funded much of the Swedish research on oral health effects of its smokeless tobacco products and helped foster the current ""tobacco harm reduction"" strategy. Electronic nicotine delivery devices are the current focus of that strategy, though data on oral health effects are sparse. CONCLUSIONS: The transnational tobacco industry has a long history of deception, corruption, and devastation, and oral health was no exception. Organized dentistry may have unwittingly aided and abetted the tobacco industry during a critical period of history.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Conversely, epidemiological studies of smokeless tobacco demonstrate decreased risk, or no elevated risk, of certain cancers versus smoking. However, it is unclear what role, if any, nicotine plays in these associations. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the available evidence from preclinical studies that examined the potential association between nicotine and the initiation and/or progression of cancer. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, PsychInfo, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for articles published from inception until February 13, 2022. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they evaluated animal cancer or tumor models, compared nicotine and non-nicotine groups, and evaluated measures of cancer initiation or progression. RESULTS: Among 1,137 identified articles, 61 were included in qualitative synthesis. Twelve studies reported data on tumor initiation, and 54 studies reported data on tumor progression. The majority of the tumor initiation studies did not identify an association between nicotine exposure and an increased risk of spontaneous tumor initiation. Results of tumor progression studies were inconsistent and varied across the reported measures, cancer type being evaluated, and animal cancer model used. Overall, the quality of reporting was poor, with many studies not demonstrating a high level of internal and/or external validity. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, although animal models have provided invaluable data for human health risk assessments of chemical exposures, the heterogeneity across the studies included in this systematic review make the interpretation and generalizability of the results difficult.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Notably, breast reconstruction restores both the functional and emotional losses patients experience due to tumor resection. Post-cancer quality of life is an important benchmark of successful treatment; therefore, breast reconstruction is an essential component that should be offered whenever possible. Over time, reconstructive techniques and outcomes have improved dramatically resulting in better patient safety and decreased operative morbidity. When counseling a patient for surgery, the provider must consider all aspects of a patient's health. Ideally, breast cancer patients should be physically, emotionally, and oncologically appropriate candidates for reconstruction. However, in concerted effort to provide opportunities for as many patients as possible, the definition of who is a good candidate for reconstruction has evolved to include higher risk patients. These patients include those with advanced age, nicotine use, obesity, and significant ptosis. With improvements in surgical procedures and perioperative care, this population may also benefit from restorative surgery. However, the exact risk of complications and necessary counseling has gone largely undefined in this population.

Although various comorbidities are hypothesized risk factors for complications, this remains incompletely understood. Our objective was to utilize multi-institutional data to characterize risk for reintervention, complications, and infections in patients with common suspected risk factors undergoing IPP placement. METHODS: We queried the TriNetX database for adult men who underwent IPP placement from 2003-2023 utilizing Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. We examined the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), nicotine use, radiation therapy (RT), radical prostatectomy (RP), and urethral surgery [urethroplasty, artificial urinary sphincter (AUS), male urethral sling (MS)] on clinical outcomes defined by International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Our primary outcome was need for reintervention based on CPT codes. Secondary outcomes included overall rates of complication and infection utilizing ICD-10 codes. Analytics were performed using TriNetX to calculate risk ratios (RRs) and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival. We evaluated outcomes overall and for each individual comparison cohort using the remaining demographic variables to perform propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS: In a total of 11,026 patients there was an overall 13.5% risk of undergoing at least one reintervention, with some undergoing multiple based on CPT codes. KM analysis showed a median IPP survival of 18.2 years and a projected 10- and 20-year survival probability at 70.6% and 48.4% respectively. Overall complication rate was 19.3% with a 5.2% rate of infection based on ICD codes. Patients with history of urethral surgery were at higher risk of both IPP complication and re-intervention. When further analyzing type of re-intervention, patients with a history of smoking, prior RP, and prior AUS/MS placement had higher rates of device removal. Patients with a history of diabetes were less likely to undergo IPP replacement at the time of explant. There were no identified risk factors for IPP infection. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest cohort of patients ever evaluated and can help guide patient selection and counseling. There was a higher rate of IPP complications than previously reported, but this may be due to different reporting parameters. History of prior urethral surgery conferred a higher risk of complications and re-intervention. These results can help guide patient selection and counseling.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Descriptive statistics were used to provide summary information on knowledge, attitude and smoking behaviors. Thematic analysis was used to analyze interview data. The sample size for both the quantitative and qualitative approach was fifteen. RESULTS: The results showed that 73% of participants were male, the mean age was 61.8 (SD =4.6) years old, and 66.7% of participants had an income less than $20,000. Eighty percent had an education level of high school or below and 73.3% were overweight or obese. Smoking history was long (mean years =39 SD =14.9), but the number of cigarettes smoked per day was low (mean =9.2 SD =7.3), and 64% of the patients had a low nicotine dependence. Assessment of knowledge and attitudes towards LDCT revealed that participants had a moderate/lower knowledge score (mean =4.3 SD =2.6), and most had a positive attitude. All participants planned to quit smoking, with 73% planning to quit within the next 6 months. Similar findings were also observed in the qualitative analysis. CONCLUSIONS: African Americans who receive LDCT lung cancer screening in this study have a moderate/lower knowledge score and positive attitude towards LDCT. Most were not heavy smokers and had a lower nicotine dependence. Understanding the factors associated with smoking cessation among at-risk African American smokers will help reduce disparities in lung cancer burden, and is important to improve health for medically underserved minority populations.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of nicotine exposure on programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. METHODS: Human lung adenocarcinoma PC9 cells were exposed to 1 µM nicotine for 3 months designated as PC9/N, and cells were stimulated with gefitinib (0, 0.1, or 1 µM) for 48 hrs. Cell viability by the MTT assay and morphological changes by immunofluorescence staining were assessed. The protein expression of EGFR, mTOR, AKT, α1-nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and PD-L1 were measured by Western blot. Gene expression of α1-nAchR and PD-L1 were examined by RT-PCR. Intratumoral levels of PD-L1 expression were compared according to the burden of smoking dosage in 54 EGFR mutant lung cancer patients. RESULTS: Cellular growth was inhibited by treatment with gefitinib, and PC9 cells were significantly more sensitive to gefitinib than PC9/N cells. Pleomorphic appearance with atypical nuclei and to be detached and shrunken with condensed nuclei in PC9 than PC9/N cells. The gene expression level of α1-nAchR and PD-L1 gene were higher in PC9/N cells compared to those in PC9 cells after treatment with gefitinib. Phosphorylation levels of EGFR, mTOR, AKT and PD-L1 level were decreased by gefitinib in PC9/N cells, which was to a lesser extent than that in PC9 cells. In tumors, heavy smokers (≥30 PY) showed 28.5% of ≥50% PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) while light smoker and never smokers had 12.5% and 9.7% of ≥50% PD-L1 TPS, respectively. However, there was no statistical significance (P value =0.628). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic nicotine exposure could increase PD-L1 expression related to intrinsic resistance to EGFR-TKI in NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutation. Considering the clinical importance of inevitable EGFR resistance, further studies regarding the role of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment are needed, especially in EGFR mutant smokers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

A major concern was the risk of cancer. Chemical analysis of e-cigarettes has shown the presence of volatile organic compounds with the potential for carcinogenicity. Comparative toxicology analysis has shown e-cigarette to have relatively lower dosages of toxins than conventional combustible cigarettes. Based on comparative analysis, e-cigarettes have been increasingly advocated as a safe alternative to conventional cigarettes. It is vital to recognize that presence of relatively lower toxin level does not preclude carcinogenic potential. The nicotine present in the e-cigarette was presumed to be the major cytotoxic agents, thus nicotine-free e-cigarette was considered as inert. On the contrary, experimental studies on oral cell lines have shown DNA strand breaks on exposure to e-cigarette vapors with or without nicotine. In addition, dysregulations of genes associated with carcinogenic pathways have also been demonstrated in oral tissues exposed to e-cigarette vapors. Despite alarming molecular data, the oral carcinogenic potential of e-cigarette remains unclear, which can be attributed to the lack of long-term prospective and large-scale case-control studies. As e-cigarette users often have other well-established risk factors (conventional cigarette smoking, alcohol, etc.) as associated habits, it is difficult to assess e-cigarette as an independent risk factor for oral cancer. Thus, the present manuscript aims to review the published literature using the Brad Ford Hill criteria of causation to determine the oral carcinogenic potential of e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

In some countries, this has been mitigated by the introduction of multiple regulatory strategies that have taken decades to implement. But even in the countries with most success at tobacco cigarette regulation, some smokers find it very hard to quit and need better treatment. Electronic cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) have emerged in the last decade or so. Initially designed to help smokers quit and produced by small independent entities, ENDS have become big business, with major transnational tobacco companies competing hard for market share where, for example, in the United States, a single device came to dominate the market within a couple of years and where soaring uptake by adolescents reached levels high enough to alarm the FDA. No doubts remain about the damaging health consequences of tobacco cigarettes. Controversies persist about e-cigarettes-their efficacy, health impacts, development of addiction and whether or not they provide a ""gateway"" to tobacco cigarette smoking. The regulation of tobacco cigarettes falls under a global WHO treaty, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC); over 180 countries are party to the FCTC. The regulation of ENDS has no such treaty, varies considerably around the world and in many countries remains completely untrammelled by specific directives. This paper will not discuss the evidence for or against the of e-cigarettes in smoking cessation (effectively discussed in this issue by Dr. Wallace) but aims to review the current state of tobacco regulation around the world, identify key differences in ENDS regulation, examine the impact of industry influence on public health policy and determine how the lessons of tobacco control should apply to ENDS.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

To assess the impact of these policies on smoking cessation in New York City, we examined over-the-counter sales of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products. METHODS: Pharmacy sales data were collected in real time as part of nontraditional surveillance activities. We used Poisson generalized estimating equations to analyze the effect of smoking-related policies on pharmacy-specific weekly sales of nicotine patches and gum. We assessed effect modification by pharmacy location. RESULTS: We observed increases in NRT product sales during the weeks of the cigarette tax increases and the smoke-free workplace law. Pharmacies in low-income areas generally had larger and more persistent increases in response to tax increases than those in higher-income areas. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time monitoring of existing nontraditional surveillance data, such as pharmacy sales of NRT products, can help assess the effects of public policies on cessation attempts. Cigarette tax increases and smoke-free workplace regulations were associated with increased smoking cessation attempts in New York City, particularly in low-income areas.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

METHODS: In 2002, New York City implemented a tobacco control strategy of (1) increased cigarette excise taxes; (2) legal action that made virtually all work-places, including bars and restaurants, smoke free; (3) increased cessation services, including a large-scale free nicotine-patch program; (4) education; and (5) evaluation. The health department also began annual surveys on a broad array of health measures, including smoking. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2003, smoking prevalence among New York City adults decreased by 11% (from 21.6% to 19.2%, approximately 140000 fewer smokers). Smoking declined among all age groups, race/ethnicities, and education levels; in both genders; among both US-born and foreign-born persons; and in all 5 boroughs. Increased taxation appeared to account for the largest proportion of the decrease; however, between 2002 and 2003 the proportion of cigarettes purchased outside New York City doubled, reducing the effective price increase by a third. CONCLUSIONS: Concerted local action can sharply reduce smoking prevalence. However, further progress will require national action, particularly to increase cigarette taxes, reduce cigarette tax evasion, expand education and cessation services, and limit tobacco marketing.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, the availability of light cigarettes may deter smoking cessation. METHODS: We analyzed the 32374 responses to the US 2000 National Health Interview Survey. Current and former smokers (""ever-smokers"") were asked if they had ever used a lower tar and nicotine cigarette to reduce health risks. Multivariable logistic regression identified determinants of lights use and smoking cessation. Results were weighted to reflect the national population. RESULTS: Of 12285 ever-smokers, 37% (N=4414) reported having used light cigarettes to reduce health risks. Current abstinence was less often reported by ever-smokers who had previously used light cigarettes than by ever-smokers who had never used lights (37% vs 53%, P<.01). Adjusted odds of cessation among ever-smokers who had used light cigarettes relative to those who had never used lights were reduced by 54% (adjusted odds ratio=0.46, 95% confidence interval=0.41, 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Use of light cigarettes was common and was associated with lower odds of current smoking cessation, validating the concern that smokers may use lights as an alternative to cessation.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Whether such uses were specifically intended for these agents is unknown.

We investigated influences on these opposing definitions and their application in expert witness testimony in litigation in the 1990s and 2000s. A scientist with ties to the tobacco industry influenced the selection of a definition of addiction that led to the classification of tobacco as a ""habituation"" in the 1964 Surgeon General's Advisory Committee report. Tobacco was later defined as addictive in the 1988 surgeon general's report. Expert witnesses for tobacco companies used the 1964 report's definition until Philip Morris Tobacco Company publicly changed its position in 1997 to agree that nicotine was addictive. Expert witnesses for plaintiffs suing the tobacco industry used the 1988 report's definition, arguing that new definitions were superior because of scientific advance. Both sides viewed addiction as an objective entity that could be defined more or less accurately.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

By the early 1960s, however, Philip Morris had also begun using ammonia to ""freebase"" the nicotine in cigarette smoke, creating low-yield (reduced-tar or -nicotine) cigarettes that still had the nicotine kick necessary to keep customers ""satisfied"" (i.e., addicted). We show that Philip Morris discovered the virtues of freebasing while analyzing the impact of the ammoniated recon used in Marlboro cigarettes. We also show how Marlboro's commercial success catalyzed efforts by the rest of the tobacco industry to discover its ""secret,"" eventually identified as ammonia technology, and how Philip Morris later exploited the myriad uses of ammonia (e.g., for flavoring and expanding tobacco volume) to defend itself against charges of manipulating the nicotine deliveries of its cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: We analyzed data from tobacco industry documents describing menthol product development, results of laboratory testing of US menthol brands, market research reports, and the 2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. RESULTS: The tobacco industry attracted new smokers by promoting cigarettes with lower menthol content, which were popular with adolescents and young adults, and provided cigarettes with higher menthol content to long-term smokers. Menthol cigarette sales remained stable from 2000 to 2005 in the United States, despite a 22% decline in overall packs sold. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco companies manipulate the sensory characteristics of cigarettes, including menthol content, thereby facilitating smoking initiation and nicotine dependence. Menthol brands that have used this strategy have been the most successful in attracting youth and young adult smokers and have grown in popularity.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

METHODS: We used a population survey in which smoking prevalence was measured each month from 1995 through 2006. Time-series analysis assessed the effect on smoking prevalence of televised antismoking advertising (with gross audience rating points [GRPs] per month), cigarette costliness, monthly sales of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and bupropion, and smoke-free restaurant laws. RESULTS: Increases in cigarette costliness and exposure to tobacco control media campaigns significantly reduced smoking prevalence. We found a 0.3-percentage-point reduction in smoking prevalence by either exposing the population to televised antismoking ads an average of almost 4 times per month (390 GRPs) or by increasing the costliness of a pack of cigarettes by 0.03% of gross average weekly earnings. Monthly sales of NRT and bupropion, exposure to NRT advertising, and smoke-free restaurant laws had no detectable impact on smoking prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in the real price of cigarettes and tobacco control mass media campaigns broadcast at sufficient exposure levels and at regular intervals are critical for reducing population smoking prevalence.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Call volume, service utilization, and quit rates at 7-month follow-up were compared between Latino (n = 243) and non-Latino (n = 527) callers. RESULTS: QuitLine calls increased among Latinos during the campaign by 57.6% (1169 vs 1842 in 3-month periods). Compared with precampaign Latino study respondents, Latino respondents during the campaign were significantly younger (younger than 45 years), more often Spanish speaking, uninsured, and less educated.

We also assessed the potential role of political ideology in support of FDA regulation of nicotine. RESULTS: Nearly 50% of the public supported mandated cigarette nicotine reduction, with another 28% having no strong opinion concerning this potential FDA regulation. Support for nicotine reduction was highest among Hispanics, African Americans, and those with less than a high school education. Among smokers, the odds of supporting FDA nicotine regulation were 2.77 times higher among smokers who intended to quit in the next 6 months than among those with no plans to quit. CONCLUSIONS: Mandating nicotine reduction in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels may reduce youth initiation and facilitate adult cessation.

These marketing strategies showed many parallels to tobacco industry strategies. Most owners engaged in some form of traditional marketing practices (e.g., print media), but only a few used radio or television advertising because of budget constraints. Owners used social media and other forms of electronic communication, pricing discounts and specials, and loyalty programs.

METHODS: We performed a content analysis of 6 months (January through June 2015) of advertising by e-cigarette brands on their company-sponsored social media channels and blogs as well as user-generated content (testimonials) appearing within brand-sponsored Web sites. An explicit claim of cessation efficacy unambiguously states that e-cigarettes help in quitting smoking, and implicit claims use euphemisms such as ""It works."" We selected a cohort of 23 leading e-cigarette brands, either by their rank in advertising spending or their prevalence in Internet searches. RESULTS: Among leading e-cigarette brands, 22 of 23 used cessation-themed advertisements. Overall, 23% of the advertisements contained cessation claims, of which 18% were explicit and 82% were implicit. CONCLUSIONS: Among leading e-cigarette advertisers, cessation themes are prevalent with implicit messaging predominating over explicit quit claims. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: These results can help the Food and Drug Administration clarify whether tobacco products should be regulated as drugs with therapeutic purpose or as recreational products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

I challenge this sense of novelty by tracing their history to the 1960s, when researchers at British American Tobacco first recognized that smokers' brains were dependent on nicotine. This discovery enabled British American Tobacco to develop a novel kind of smoking device under the codename ""Ariel"" between 1962 and 1967. Whereas filters were meant to eliminate specific harmful constituents of tobacco smoke, Project Ariel tried to reduce smoking to its alkaloid essence: nicotine. By heating instead of burning tobacco, the scientists working on Ariel managed to produce an aerosol smoking device that delivered nicotine with very little tar while retaining the look and feel of a cigarette. However, after receiving two patents for Ariel, British American Tobacco ultimately decided to abandon the project to avoid endangering cigarettes, its main product. Today, as e-cigarettes are surging in popularity, it is worth revisiting Ariel because it is not just an episode in the history of aerosol smoking devices but its starting point.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The tobacco industry opposed NRT when it first appeared in the 1980s but by 2016 was marketing its own NRT products. We used internal tobacco industry documents dated 1960 through 2010 to identify the industry's perceptions of NRT. As early as the 1950s, tobacco companies developed nonsmoked nicotine replacements for cigarettes, but they stopped out of concern that marketing such products would trigger Food and Drug Administration regulation of cigarettes. In the 1990s, after pharmaceutical companies began selling prescription NRT, tobacco companies found that many smokers used NRT to supplement smoking rather than to quit. In 2009, once the Food and Drug Administration began regulating tobacco, tobacco companies restarted their plans to capture the nicotine market. Although the tobacco industry initially viewed NRT as a threat, it found that smokers often combined NRT with smoking rather than using it as a replacement and began marketing their own NRT products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Following aborted efforts during the 1980s and 1990s to develop reduced-risk products, TTCs have heavily invested in selected NNDS products since 2010 via acquisitions and internal research and development. This article catalogs and analyzes the patterns of investment in NNDSs by leading TTCs over time, and identifies differences in the companies' approaches to NNDS product acquisition and development in specific markets globally. This analysis raises important questions regarding the companies' intent, which appears to be to sustain, rather than replace, cigarette sales, and to increase their influence and credibility with respect to NNDS policy and regulation. We identify the need for greater public health vigilance and research to understand and respond to the increasingly significant role of NNDSs in TTCs' global business strategies, to ensure that NNDSs advance, rather than hinder, tobacco control efforts.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Tobacco companies have actively promoted the substitution of cigarettes with purportedly safer tobacco products (e.g., smokeless tobacco, e-cigarettes) as tobacco harm reduction (THR). Given the tobacco, e-cigarette, and pharmaceutical industries' substantial financial interests, we quantified industry influence on support for THR. Objectives. To analyze a comprehensive set of articles published in peer-reviewed journals assessing funding sources and support for or opposition to substitution of tobacco or nicotine products as harm reduction. Search Methods. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO with a comprehensive search string including all articles, comments, and editorials published between January 1, 1992, and July 26, 2016. Selection Criteria. We included English-language publications published in peer-reviewed journals addressing THR in humans and excluded studies on modified cigarettes, on South Asian smokeless tobacco variants, on pregnant women, on animals, not mentioning a tobacco or nicotine product, on US Food and Drug Administration-approved nicotine replacement therapies, and on nicotine vaccines. Data Collection and Analysis. We double-coded all articles for article type; primary product type (e.g., snus, e-cigarettes); themes for and against THR; stance on THR; THR concepts; funding or affiliation with tobacco, e-cigarette, pharmaceutical industry, or multiple industries; and each author's country. We fit exact logistic regression models with stance on THR as the outcome (pro- vs anti-THR) and source of funding or industry affiliation as the predictor taking into account sparse data. Additional models included article type as the outcome (nonempirical or empirical) and industry funding or affiliation as predictor, and stratified analyses for empirical and nonempirical studies with stance on THR as outcome and funding source as predictor. Main Results. Searches retrieved 826 articles, including nonempirical articles (21%), letters or commentaries (34%), editorials (5%), cross-sectional studies (15%), systematic reviews and meta-analyses (3%), and randomized controlled trials (2%). Overall, 23.9% disclosed support by industry; 49% of articles endorsed THR, 42% opposed it, and 9% took neutral or mixed positions. Support from the e-cigarette industry (odds ratio [OR] = 20.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3, 180.7), tobacco industry (OR = 59.4; 95% CI = 10.1, +infinity), or pharmaceutical industry (OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 1.3, 3.7) was significantly associated with supportive stance on THR in analyses accounting for sparse data. Authors' Conclusions. Non-industry-funded articles were evenly divided in stance, while industry-funded articles favored THR. Because of their quantity, letters and comments may influence perceptions of THR when empirical studies lack consensus. Public Health Implications. Public health practitioners and researchers need to account for industry funding when interpreting the evidence in THR debates.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,No,

RESULTS: Most legislators agreed that secondhand smoke can cause lung cancer in nonsmokers, and a majority believed that smokers are addicted to nicotine. More than 75% stated that they would support a measure to enforce laws preventing tobacco sales to youth. A majority of Texas and Vermont legislators supported an increase in the state cigarette excise tax; 43% of North Carolina legislators would support an increase if revenues were directed toward tobacco farmer diversification.

METHODS: Between March 8, 2021 and December 17, 2021, adult patients (≥ 18 years) admitted to 6 hospitals affiliated with the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) were screened for their cigarette status. Patients who smoked cigarettes were referred to an TTP offering a brief bedside consult and automated post-discharge follow-up calls with an opportunity to receive a referral to the South Carolina Quitline (SCQL). The hospitals included in this study ranged in size from 82 to 715 beds with diverse patient populations. Herein, we report on the results of screening and referring patients to the TTP, delivery of smoking cessation treatments, and patient smoking status assessed in a sample of patients followed 6-weeks after discharge from the hospital. RESULTS: Smoking prevalence ranged from 14-49% across the 6 hospitals. Among eligible patients reached, 85.6% accepted the bedside consult. Only 3.4% of patients reached were deemed ineligible because they claimed not to be currently smoking cigarettes. The automated post-discharge follow-up calls were answered by 43% of patients, with about a third of those who had relapsed back to smoking accepting the offer of a referral to the SCQL. Overall, about half of the 6,000 patients referred to the TTP received some type of treatment. Self-reported smoking abstinence rates assessed 6-weeks after discharge were similar across the five acute care hospitals ranging from about 20-30%.

It is unknown whether the use of 6MN has spread to the oral nicotine pouch product category that has become increasingly popular. METHODS: Industry reports and the USPTO database were searched for informationon 6-methyl nicotine products. The search terms ""Metatine"", ""Nixotine"", ""Imotine"" and ""pouches"" were shortlisted and used to identify US-marketed pouch products. Ingredient contents were compared to popular products, and safety warnings and regulatory statements assessed in context with US state and federal regulations. RESULTS: Two US-based brands, ""MG"" and ""Hippotine"" pouches, were identified in August 2024, advertised to contain ""Imotine""-trademarked 6MN. MG Pouches are marketed in four youth-appealing flavors. ""Hippotine""-branded pouches are marketed in two flavors. 6MN contents ranged between 8mg - 25mg with almost identical ingredient lists otherwise. Products list extensive addiction and health warnings, including warnings not to operate vehicles. Vendors state that these are not a tobacco product, implicating that federal and state tobacco regulations do not apply. CONCLUSIONS: The spread of nicotine analogues to additional product categories such as oral pouches is concerning, especially given the high 6MN contents that exceed nicotine contents in popular US-marketed oral nicotine pouch products. Legislators and regulators need to provide certainty about the regulatory status of nicotine analogues to prevent further erosion of tobacco flavor bans and other regulations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Recently, the high-intensity artificial sweetener, neotame, was detected in nicotine analogue-containing and ""zero nicotine"" electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). The prevalence of neotame in popular US-marketed disposable e-cigarettes remains unknown. METHODS: Popular disposable e-cigarette devices were chosen based on 2024 US market surveys and analyzed for neotame using Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LCMS). Nicotine, 6-methyl nicotine and cooling compounds were also quantified. Contents of FDA-approved e-cigarettes, nicotine analogue-containing, ""zero-nicotine"" disposables and a candy product were compared. RESULTS: Neotame was detected in all 57 tested popular disposable e-cigarette devices, zero-nicotine, and nicotine analogue products, but not in 13 FDA-approved nor Juul products. 2 disposable products marketed in 2021 also contained neotame. The synthetic coolant WS-23 was detected in the large majority of tested products, with menthol and WS-3 less prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of the artificial sweetener neotame in disposable e-cigarettes raises concerns about its effects on appeal and abuse potential of these products, especially in combination with cooling and sweet-associated flavors (fruit, candy) known to be preferred by youth. While more heat-stable than other artificial sweeteners, the degradation of neotame in e-cigarettes needs to be investigated and assessed for potential toxicity.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, these devices contain harmful chemicals, and there are safety concerns. We have investigated the effects of e-cigs on the inflammatory response and viability of COPD bronchial epithelial cells (BECs). METHODS: BECs from COPD patients and controls were exposed to e-cig vapor extract (ECVE) and the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, C-X-C motif ligand 8 (CXCL8), and lactate dehydrogenase release were measured. We also examined the effect of ECVE pretreatment on polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)-stimulated cytokine release from BECs. Parallel experiments using Calu-3 cells were performed. Comparisons were made with cigarette smoke extract (CSE). RESULTS: ECVE and CSE caused an increase in the release of IL-6 and CXCL8 from Calu-3 cells. ECVE only caused toxicity in BECs and Calu-3 cells. Furthermore, ECVE and CSE dampened poly I:C-stimulated C-X-C motif ligand 10 release from both cell culture models, reaching statistical significance for CSE at an optical density of 0.3. CONCLUSION: ECVE caused toxicity and reduced the antiviral response to poly I:C. This raises concerns over the safety of e-cig use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The number of physically active people in Germany is still too low. METHODS: In ELITE study in Germany, 4602 participants are regularly examined for cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF). The aim is to motivate participants to improve their CVRF through individual recommendations and regular follow-up. Here, the PA data are presented in correlation with CVRF at baseline. A feature of this presentation is that the usual CVRF but also the effects on psychosocial factors were recorded simultaneously. RESULTS: Participants were divided into 3 groups based on their PA: 1. frequent exercise (FE): daily to 2-3x per week (41.4%), 2. moderate exercise (ME): 1x/week to 2x/month (28.8%), 3. rarely exercise (RE): 1x/month to not at all (29.8%). Age did not differ in the 3 groups. The most common CVRF was arterial hypertension, which decreased significantly with an increase in PA. Diabetes, nicotine, and increased BMI were also significantly less frequent in group 1. Antihypertensives were taken less frequently in this group 1. Less physically active participants were significantly more likely to have 3 or more additional CVRF. While group 1 consumed more fruit (64%) and considerably less pork, in group 2 and 3 only 58.3% and 50.3% respectively included fruit in their diet. FE also had a favorable effect on stress, depression and general well-being, all of which were significantly better in group 1. CONCLUSION: Results confirm the beneficial influences of exercise on known CVRF and on psychosocial parameters. The prevalence of several CVRF per person at low levels of sport is of particular concern, as these participants would benefit most. During a 5-year follow-up, participants will receive intensive education on the need to increase PA. It remains to be seen how successful the effort will be.",['Nicotine/NRT'],No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

For some of them, particularly if they have failed in previous cessation attempts and have smoking-related disorders, a long term reduction of tobacco consumption may be proposed as the 'second best' attitude and may offer a perspective for reduction of some of the risk factors associated with smoking. This attitude, which cannot be regarded as a general health policy, usually requires the prolonged use of nicotine replacement therapy. From available studies, it does not seem that a period of sustained smoking reduction decreases the chance of future cessation, it may even increase it.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The second phase, which began in the early 1960s in response to the landmark 1964 U.S. Surgeon General's report that linked smoking with lung cancer and other diseases, included the introduction of purportedly low tar and nicotine cigarettes. Subsequent research found that both filters and low tar and nicotine cigarettes were ineffective approaches to reducing health risks associated with smoking. Despite this, these product design changes were used in tobacco industry marketing campaigns to allay consumer health concerns and stabilize tobacco markets and sales. Since 2004, a new risk or harm reduction phase has occurred with the backing by Philip Morris as well as major U.S. health groups of U.S. Food and Drug Administration legislation that would require disclosure of tobacco ingredients, ban misleading health claims, prohibit or reduce harmful ingredients, and require prior approval of tobacco design, performance changes, and modified risk tobacco products. However, current scientific literature indicates that there is no scientific consensus and little evidence on what tobacco ingredients are linked to particular morbidities and mortalities and at what levels. This will allow the tobacco industry to implicitly or explicitly claim their products are ""safer."" Instead, health advocates should advocate for scientifically proven policy measures such as smoke free public places or higher tobacco taxes that control and reduce tobacco markets and consumption.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Data on cigarette use were obtained from reports published by the government and tobacco manufacturers. Over the study period, there has been a coherent pattern of cigarette modification in Japan. The sales-weighted average yields have declined from 20.7 mg tar and 1.64 mg nicotine/cigarette in 1969 to 8.7 mg tar and 0.72 mg nicotine/cigarette in 1996. On the other hand, the average daily consumption per smoker has continuously increased over the same period. Average nicotine yields and daily cigarette consumption have significant negative correlations among both males and females. This relationship was observed even after controlling for the price changes of cigarettes over time. It is indicated that smokers have compensated for reduced nicotine yields by increasing daily consumption. This may have offset potential benefits of the continuous decline in tar and nicotine yields to smokers' health.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study investigates awareness and perception of HTPs among tobacco users and whether perceptions of HTPs are associated with HTP use and intention to quit. METHODS: We invited 2,000 tobacco users aged 19-65 years with countrywide representation to an online survey in November 2018. Information on general characteristics, tobacco use behaviors, awareness and perception of HTPs, and intention to quit were gathered. Multinomial logistic regression analysis and ANCOVA were used for estimation of association and comparison. RESULTS: Among all tobacco users, 36.8% were classified as ever users, whereas 28.3% had used HTPs in the past 30 days, which was higher than expected. Users of liquid-based e-cigarettes (odds ratio [OR] 1.578; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.210-2.056) and poly-product users (OR 2.029; 95% CI, 1.121-3.671) showed higher intention to quit within 1 month when compared to users of conventional cigarettes (CCs), whereas HTP users and dual product users did not. HTP users rated HTPs more favorably than CCs in terms of smoke, smell, harm, aid in quitting, design, and price than users of other products did (P-value < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We find that positive perception of HTPs following strategic marketing from tobacco companies could have contributed to a greater increase in HTP use than expected in Korea. However, HTPs might not be considered substitutes for CCs for quitting tobacco use because a significant proportion of dual product users reported a lower intention to quit.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The U.S. government produces a ""Report on Carcinogens"" every two years, which lists known and likely human carcinogenic substances. In the late 1990s the tobacco industry responded to the proposed listing of secondhand smoke with a multi-part strategy. Despite industry efforts to challenge both the substance of the report and the agency procedures, environmental tobacco smoke was declared by the agency in 2000 to be a known human carcinogen. A subsequent lawsuit, launched by chemical interests but linked to the tobacco industry, failed, but it produced a particular legal precedent of judicial review that is favorable to all regulated industries.

The Philip Morris International (PMI) Tobacco Heating System (THS) 2.2 is a novel tobacco product with the potential to reduce the risk of harm in smokers compared to continued smoking of combustible cigarettes. It heats tobacco electrically in a controlled manner, never allowing the temperature to exceed 350°C, thereby preventing the combustion process from taking place and producing substantially lower levels of toxicants while providing nicotine, taste, ritual, and a sensory experience that closely parallels combustible cigarettes. Previous clinical studies have demonstrated reduced exposure to the toxicants (approaching the levels observed after quitting) for smokers who switched to THS 2.2, for three months. For adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking combustible cigarettes, switching to THS 2.2 may represent an alternative way to reduce the risk of tobacco-related diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to further substantiate the harm reduction potential of THS 2.2 by demonstrating favorable changes in a set of 8 coprimary endpoints, representative of pathomechanistic pathways (ie, inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, respiratory function, and genotoxicity), linked to smoking-related diseases, in smokers switching from combustible cigarettes to THS 2.2. METHODS: This study was a randomized, controlled, two-arm parallel group, multicenter ambulatory US study conducted in healthy adult smokers switching from combustible cigarettes to THS 2.2 compared with smokers continuing to smoke combustible cigarettes for six months. Subjects had a smoking history of at least ten years and did not intend to quit within the next six months. RESULTS: Enrollment started in March 2015 and the trial was completed in September 2016. In total, 984 subjects were randomized (combustible cigarettes, n=483; THS 2.2, n=477), and 803 completed the study. The results are expected to be available in a subsequent publication in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we describe the rationale and design for this clinical study that focused on the evaluation of THS 2.2's potential to reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases compared with that of combustible cigarettes. This study will provide insights regarding favorable changes in biological and functional endpoints informed by effects known to be seen upon smoking cessation.

The uptake of these devices has escalated despite inconclusive evidence of their efficacy as a smoking cessation device and unknown long-term health consequences. As smoking rates continue to drop or plateau in many well-developed countries, transnational tobacco companies have transitioned into the vaping industry and are now using social media to promote their products. Evidence indicates e-cigarettes are being marketed on social media as a harm reduction alternative, with retailers and manufacturers utilizing marketing techniques historically used by the tobacco industry. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify and describe the messages presented in e-cigarette-related social media (Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest) promotions and discussions and identify future directions for research, surveillance, and regulation. METHODS: Data sources included MEDLINE, Scopus, ProQuest, Informit, the Journal of Medical Internet Research, and Google Scholar. Included studies were published in English between 2007 and 2017, analyzed content captured from e-cigarette-related social media promotions or discussions, and reported results for e-cigarettes separately from other forms of tobacco and nicotine delivery. Database search ceased in October 2017. Initial searches identified 536 studies. Two reviewers screened studies by title and abstract. One reviewer examined 71 full-text articles to determine eligibility and identified 25 studies for inclusion. This process was undertaken with the assistance of the Web-based screening and data extraction tool-Covidence. The review was registered with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Systematic Reviews database and followed the methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. RESULTS: Several key messages are being used to promote e-cigarettes including as a safer alternative to cigarettes, efficacy as a smoking cessation aid, and for use where smoking is prohibited. Other major marketing efforts aimed at capturing a larger market involve promotion of innovative flavoring and highlighting the public performance of vaping. Discussion and promotion of these devices appear to be predominantly occurring among the general public and those with vested interests such as retailers and manufacturers. There is a noticeable silence from the public health and government sector in these discussions on social media. CONCLUSIONS: The social media landscape is dominated by pro-vaping messages disseminated by the vaping industry and vaping proponents. The uncertainty surrounding e-cigarette regulation expressed within the public health field appears not to be reflected in ongoing social media dialogues and highlights the need for public health professionals to interact with the public to actively influence social media conversations and create a more balanced discussion. With the vaping industry changing so rapidly, real-time monitoring and surveillance of how these devices are discussed, promoted, and used on social media is necessary in conjunction with evidence published in academic journals.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Social media hold promise as a scalable intervention strategy to promote smoking treatment utilization and cessation, given the barriers to treatment delivery (ie, geographic remoteness, limited funding, climate, and travel costs) in the state of Alaska (AK). Building on a longstanding tobacco control research partnership with the AK Tribal Health System, in this study, we are developing and pilot-testing a culturally relevant, Facebook (FB)-delivered intervention that incorporates a digital storytelling approach adapted from the effective Centers for Disease Control Tips from Former Smokers campaign. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to promote evidence-based smoking treatment (eg, state quitline and Tribal cessation programs) uptake and cessation among AN people. METHODS: This study fulfills the objectives for stage 1 of the National Institute on Drug Abuse behavioral integrative treatment development program. In stage 1a, we will use a mixed method approach to develop the FB intervention. Cultural variance and surface/deep structure frameworks will address the influence of culture in designing health messages. These developmental activities will include qualitative and quantitative assessments, followed by beta testing of proposed intervention content. In stage 1b, we will conduct a randomized pilot trial enrolling 60 AN adults who smoke. We will evaluate the feasibility, uptake, consumer response, and potential efficacy of the FB intervention compared with a control condition (quitline/treatment referral only). Primary outcome measures include feasibility and biochemically verified smoking abstinence at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups. Secondary outcomes will include self-reported smoking cessation treatment utilization and abstinence from tobacco/nicotine products. We will also explore interdependence (relationship orientation and collaborative efforts in lifestyle change) as a culturally relevant mediator of intervention efficacy. RESULTS: The study enrolled 40 participants for phase 1, with data saturation being achieved at 30 AN people who smoke and 10 stakeholders. For phase 2, we enrolled 40 participants. Qualitative assessment of proposed intervention content was completed with 30 AN smokers and 10 stakeholders. We are currently analyzing data from the quantitative assessment with 40 participants in preparation for the beta testing, followed by the randomized pilot trial. CONCLUSIONS: The project is innovative for its use of social media communication tools that are culturally relevant in a behavioral intervention designed to reach AN people statewide to promote smoking treatment utilization and cessation. The study will further advance tobacco cessation research in an underserved disparity group. If the pilot intervention is successful, we will have a blueprint to conduct a large randomized controlled efficacy trial. Our approach could be considered for other remote AN communities to enhance the reach of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatments.

Although only a few longitudinal studies have assessed the outcome of periodontal disease after smoking cessation, they indicated that recovery after nonsurgical treatment was more successful in those who had quit smoking. As part of tobacco harm reduction strategies, substituting cigarettes with alternative, less harmful tobacco products is an approach complementary to cessation for smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke. The Tobacco Heating System (THS), developed by Philip Morris International (commercialized as IQOS), is part of the heat-not-burn product category. The IQOS device electrically heats tobacco instead of burning it, at much lower temperatures than cigarettes, thereby producing substantially lower levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents, while providing the nicotine, taste, ritual, and a sensory experience that closely parallel those of cigarettes. Phillip Morris International has published the results from a broad clinical assessment program, which was established to scientifically substantiate the harm reduction potential of the THS among adult healthy smokers switching to the THS. The program is now progressing toward including adult smokers with smoking-related diseases. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to demonstrate favorable changes of periodontal endpoints in response to mechanical periodontal therapy in patients with generalized chronic periodontitis who completely switched to THS use compared with continued cigarette smoking. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled two-arm parallel-group multicenter Japanese study conducted in patients with chronic generalized periodontitis who switch from cigarettes to THS compared with smokers continuing to smoke cigarettes for 6 months. The patients were treated with mechanical periodontal therapy as per standard of care in Japan. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the beneficial effect of switching to THS use compared with continued cigarette smoking on pocket depth (PD) reduction in all sites with an initial PD≥4 mm. The secondary objectives include evaluation of other periodontal parameters (eg, clinical attachment level or gingival inflammation) and overall oral health status upon switching to THS. Safety was monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: In total, 172 subjects were randomized to the cigarette (n=86) or THS (n=86) groups, and all 172 completed the study. The conduct phase of the study is completed, while data cleaning and analyses are ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to test a heat-not-burn tobacco product in smokers with an already established disease. The results should further strengthen the evidence that switching to THS can significantly reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases if favorable changes in the evolution of chronic generalized periodontitis after mechanical therapy are found when compared with continued cigarette smoking.

Social media's increasing pervasiveness has provided a powerful avenue to market products and influence social norms and risk behaviors. At present, there is no evidence of how e-cigarettes and vaping are promoted on social media in Australia. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate how e-cigarettes are portrayed and promoted on Twitter through a content analysis of vaping-related tweets containing an image posted and retweeted by Australian users and how the portrayal and promotion have emerged and trended over time. METHODS: In total, we analyzed 1303 tweets and accompanying images from 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 collected through the Tracking Infrastructure for Social Media Analysis (TrISMA), a contemporary technical and organizational infrastructure for the tracking of public communication by Australian users of social media, via a list of 15 popular e-cigarette-related terms. RESULTS: Despite Australia's cautious approach toward e-cigarettes and the limited evidence supporting them as an efficacious smoking cessation aid, it is evident that there is a concerted effort by some Twitter users to promote these devices as a health-conducive (91/129, 70.5%), smoking cessation product (266/1303, 20.41%). Further, Twitter is being used in an attempt to circumvent Australian regulation and advocate for a more liberal approach to personal vaporizers (90/1303, 6.90%). A sizeable proportion of posts was dedicated to selling or promoting vape products (347/1303, 26.63%), and 19.95% (260/1303) were found to be business listings. These posts used methods to try and expand their clientele further than immediate followers by touting competitions and giveaways, with those wanting to enter having to perform a sequence of steps such as liking, tagging, and reposting, ultimately exposing the post among the user's network and to others not necessarily interested in vaping. CONCLUSIONS: The borderless nature of social media presents a clear challenge for enforcing Article 13 of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which requires all ratifying nations to implement a ban on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship. Countering the advertising and promotion of these products is a public health challenge that will require cross-border cooperation with other World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control parties. Further research aimed at developing strategies to counter the advertising and promotion of e-cigarettes is therefore needed.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,Yes,

Twitter is a Web-based platform that allows people to communicate with each other throughout the day using their phone. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to leverage the social media platform of Twitter for fostering peer-to-peer support to decrease relapse with quitting smoking. Furthermore, the study will compare the effects of coed versus women-only groups on women's success with quitting smoking. METHODS: The study design is a Web-based, three-arm randomized controlled trial with two treatment arms (a coed or women-only Twitter support group) and a control arm. Participants are recruited online and are randomized to one of the conditions. All participants will receive 8 weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy (patches plus their choice of gum or lozenges), serial emails with links to Smokefree.gov quit guides, and instructions to record their quit date online (and to quit smoking on that date) on a date falling within a week of initiation of the study. Participants randomized to a treatment arm are placed in a fully automated Twitter support group (coed or women-only), paired with a buddy (matched on age, gender, location, and education), and encouraged to communicate with the group and buddy via daily tweeted discussion topics and daily automated feedback texts (a positive tweet if they tweet and an encouraging tweet if they miss tweeting). Recruited online from across the continental United States, the sample consists of 215 male and 745 female current cigarette smokers wanting to quit, aged between 21 and 59 years. Self-assessed follow-up surveys are completed online at 1, 3, and 6 months after the date they selected to quit smoking, with salivary cotinine validation at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome is sustained biochemically confirmed abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: From November 2016 to September 2018, 960 participants in 36 groups were recruited for the randomized controlled trial, in addition to 20 participants in an initial pilot group. Data analysis will commence soon for the randomized controlled trial based on data from 896 of the 960 participants (93.3%), with 56 participants lost to follow-up and 8 dropouts. CONCLUSIONS: This study combines the mobile platform of Twitter with a support group for quitting smoking.

For adolescents of lower socioeconomic status (SES), exposure is widespread, evidenced in the measurement of urinary cotinine, a major metabolite of nicotine. Direct intervention with exposed children has been proposed as a novel method, yet there is minimal evidence of its efficacy. Combining this approach with a mobile health (mHealth) intervention may be more time and cost-effective and feasible for adolescent populations. OBJECTIVE: In this pilot study, we assessed the feasibility and preliminary evidence of efficacy of a 30-day text message-based mHealth intervention targeted at reducing SHS exposure in adolescent populations of low SES. METHODS: For the study, 14 nonsmoking and nonvaping participants between the ages of 12-21 years exposed to SHS were enrolled. The intervention consisted of a daily text message sent to the participants over the course of a month. Text message types included facts and information about SHS, behavioral methods for SHS avoidance, or true-or-false questions. Participants were asked to respond to each message within 24 hours as confirmation of receipt. Feasibility outcomes included completion of the 30-day intervention, receiving and responding to text messages, and feedback on the messages. Efficacy outcomes included a reduction in urinary cotinine, accuracy of true-or-false responses, and participants' perceptions of effectiveness. RESULTS: Of the 14 participants that were enrolled, 13 completed the intervention. Though not required, all participants had their own cell phones with unlimited text messaging plans. Of the total number of text messages sent to the 13 completers, 91% (372/407) of them received on-time responses. Participant feedback was generally positive, with most requesting more informational and true-or-false questions. In terms of efficacy, 54% (6/11) of participants reduced their cotinine levels (however, change for the group overall was not statistically significant (P=.33) and 45% (5/11) of participants increased their cotinine levels. Of the total number of true-or-false questions sent across all completers, 77% (56/73) were answered correctly. Participants' ratings of message effectiveness averaged 85 on a scale of 100. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, the intervention was feasible as the majority of participants had access to a cell phone, completed the study, and engaged by responding to the messages. The efficacy of the study requires further replication, as only half of the participants reduced their cotinine levels. However, participants answered the majority of true-or-false questions accurately and reported that the messages were helpful.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

While the link between traditional tobacco products and lung cancer is well established, it is not known how the public perceives the association between electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and lung cancer. In addition, it is unclear how members of the public interact with official messages during cancer campaigns on tobacco consumption and lung cancer. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to analyze e-cigarette and smoking tweets in the context of lung cancer during National Cancer Prevention Month in 2018 and examine how e-cigarette and traditional tobacco product discussions relate to implementation of tobacco control policies across different states in the United States. METHODS: We mined tweets that contained the term ""lung cancer"" on Twitter from February to March 2018. The data set contained 13,946 publicly available tweets that occurred during National Cancer Prevention Month (February 2018), and 10,153 tweets that occurred during March 2018. E-cigarette-related and smoking-related tweets were retrieved, using topic modeling and geospatial analysis. RESULTS: Debates on harmfulness (454/915, 49.7%), personal experiences (316/915, 34.5%), and e-cigarette risks (145/915, 15.8%) were the major themes of e-cigarette tweets related to lung cancer. Policy discussions (2251/3870, 58.1%), smoking risks (843/3870, 21.8%), and personal experiences (776/3870, 20.1%) were the major themes of smoking tweets related to lung cancer. Geospatial analysis showed that discussion on e-cigarette risks was positively correlated with the number of state-level smoke-free policies enacted for e-cigarettes. In particular, the number of indoor and on campus smoke-free policies was related to the number of tweets on e-cigarette risks (smoke-free indoor, r49=0.33, P=.02; smoke-free campus, r49=0.32, P=.02). The total number of e-cigarette policies was also positively related to the number of tweets on e-cigarette risks (r49=0.32, P=.02). In contrast, the number of smoking policies was not significantly associated with any of the smoking themes in the lung cancer discourse (P>.13). CONCLUSIONS: Though people recognized the importance of traditional tobacco control policies in reducing lung cancer incidences, their views on e-cigarette risks were divided, and discussions on the importance of e-cigarette policy control were missing from public discourse. Findings suggest the need for health organizations to continuously engage the public in discussions on the potential health risks of e-cigarettes and raise awareness of the insidious lobbying efforts from the tobacco industry.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

One strategy the alternative tobacco industry uses to mobilize political action is coordinating on social media platforms, such as the social networking site Facebook. However, few studies have specifically assessed how platforms such as Facebook are used to influence public sentiment and attitudes towards tobacco control policy. OBJECTIVE: This study used social network analysis to examine how the alternative tobacco industry uses Facebook to mobilize online users to influence tobacco control policy outcomes with a focus on the state of California. METHODS: Data were collected from local and national alternative tobacco Facebook groups that had affiliations with activities in the state of California. Network ties were constructed based on users' reactions to posts (eg, ""like"" and ""love"") and comments to characterize political mobilization networks. RESULTS: Findings show that alternative tobacco industry employees were more likely to engage within these networks and that these employees were also more likely to be influential members (ie, be more active) in the network. Comparisons between subnetworks show that communication within the local alternative tobacco advocacy group network was less dense and more centralized in contrast to a national advocacy group that had overall higher levels of engagement among members. A timeline analysis found that a higher number of influential posts that disseminated widely across networks occurred during e-cigarette-related legislative events, suggesting strategic online engagement and increased mobilization of online activity for the purposes of influencing policy outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study provide important insights into how tobacco industry-related advocacy groups leverage the Facebook platform to mobilize their online constituents in an effort to influence public perceptions and coordinate to defeat tobacco control efforts at the local, state, and federal level. Study results reveal one part of a vast network of socially enabled alternative tobacco industry actors and constituents that use Facebook as a mobilization point to support goals of the alternative tobacco industry.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe excessive smartphone use and associated factors among adolescents, focusing on comparisons between boys and girls. METHODS: This study was based on data collected through a large-scale public health survey distributed in 2016 to pupils in the 9th grade of primary school and those in the 2nd grade of secondary school. Bayesian binomial regression models, with weakly informative priors, were used to examine whether the frequency of associated factors differed between those who reported excessive smartphone use and those who did not. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 77% (9143/11,868) among 9th grade pupils and 73.4% (7949/10,832) among 2nd grade pupils, resulting in a total of 17,092 responses. Based on the estimated median absolute percentage differences, along with associated odds ratios, we found that excessive smartphone use was associated with the use of cigarettes, alcohol, and other substances. The reporting of anxiety and worry along with feeling low more than once a week consistently increased the odds of excessive smartphone use among girls, whereas anxiety and worry elevated the odds of excessive smartphone use among boys. The reporting of less than 7 hours of sleep per night was associated with excessive smartphone use in all 4 study groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results varied across gender and grade in terms of robustness and the size of estimated difference. However, excessive smartphone use was associated with a higher frequency of multiple suspected associated factors, including ever having tried smoking, alcohol, or other substances; poor sleep; and often feeling low and feeling anxious.

This vulnerable population is also at risk for exposed brand marketing and advertisement of e-cigarettes on social media. Understanding predictors of how e-cigarette manufacturers conduct social media advertising and marketing could benefit public health approaches to addressing e-cigarette use. OBJECTIVE: This study documents factors that predict changes in daily frequency of commercial tweets about e-cigarettes using time series modeling techniques. METHODS: We analyzed data on the daily frequency of commercial tweets about e-cigarettes collected between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2020. We fit the data to an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and unobserved components model (UCM). Four measures assessed model prediction accuracy. Predictors in the UCM include days with events related to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), non-FDA-related events with significant importance such as academic or news announcements, weekday versus weekend, and the period when JUUL maintained an active Twitter account (ie, actively tweeting from their corporate Twitter account) versus when JUUL stopped tweeting. RESULTS: When the 2 statistical models were fit to the data, the results indicate that the UCM was the best modeling technique for our data. All 4 predictors included in the UCM were significant predictors of the daily frequency of commercial tweets about e-cigarettes. On average, brand advertisement and marketing of e-cigarettes on Twitter was higher by more than 150 advertisements on days with FDA-related events compared to days without FDA events. Similarly, more than 40 commercial tweets about e-cigarettes were, on average, recorded on days with important non-FDA events compared to days without such events. We also found that there were more commercial tweets about e-cigarettes on weekdays than on weekends and more commercial tweets when JUUL maintained an active Twitter account. CONCLUSIONS: e-Cigarette companies promote their products on Twitter. Commercial tweets were significantly more likely to be posted on days with important FDA announcements, which may alter the narrative about information shared by the FDA. There remains a need for regulation of digital marketing of e-cigarette products in the United States.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Efficient recruitment and data capture processes are needed to collect relevant information in a near-to-real-world environment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study was to develop and test a protocol for an actual use study of a new tobacco product. The product included in this study was a commercially available oral nicotine pouch. Through the process of study design and execution, learnings were garnered to inform the design, execution, analysis, and report writing of future full-scale actual use studies with tobacco products. METHODS: A small sample (n=100) of healthy adult daily smokers of 7 or more cigarettes per day were recruited to participate in an 8-week prospective observational study conducted at 4 geographically dispersed sites in the United States. A smartphone-based customized electronic diary (eDiary) was employed to capture daily tobacco product use, including 1 week of baseline smoking and 6 weeks during which participants were provided with oral nicotine pouches for use as desired. RESULTS: Online screening procedures with follow-up telephone interviews and on-site enrollment were successfully implemented. Of 100 participants, 97 completed the study, with more than half (59/99, 60%) identifying as dual- or poly-users of cigarettes and other types of tobacco products at baseline. There was more than 90% (91-93/99, 92%-94%) compliance with daily eDiary reporting, and the majority (92/99, 93%) of participants expressed satisfaction with the study processes. Product use data from the eDiary indicated that after an initial period of trial use, pouches per day increased among those continuing to use the products, while per day average cigarette consumption decreased for 82% (79/97) of all study participants. At the end of the week 6, 16% (15/97) of participants had reduced their cigarette consumption by more than half. CONCLUSIONS: The design of this study, including recruiting, enrollment, eDiary use, and oversight, was successfully implemented through the application of a detailed protocol, a user-friendly eDiary, electronically administered questionnaires, and remote monitoring procedures. High-resolution information was obtained on prospective changes in tobacco product use patterns in the context of availability of a new tobacco product. Future, larger actual use studies will provide important evidence supporting the role that alternatives to combustible cigarettes may play in smoking reduction and/or cessation and lowering the population health burden of tobacco and nicotine-containing products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The Vaping and Patterns of E-cigarette Use Research (VAPER) Study is a web-based longitudinal survey designed to observe patterns in device and liquid use that suggest the benefits and unintended consequences of potential e-cigarette regulations. The heterogeneity of the e-cigarette devices and liquids on the market, the customizability of the devices and liquids, and the lack of standardized reporting requirements result in unique measurement challenges. Furthermore, bots and survey takers who submit falsified responses are threats to data integrity that require mitigation strategies. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to describe the protocols for 3 waves of the VAPER Study and discuss recruitment and data processing experiences and lessons learned, including the benefits and limitations of bot- and fraudulent survey taker-related strategies. METHODS: American adults (aged ≥21 years) who use e-cigarettes ≥5 days per week are recruited from up to 404 Craigslist catchment areas covering all 50 states. The questionnaire measures and skip logic are designed to accommodate marketplace heterogeneity and user customization (eg, different skip logic pathways for different device types and customizations). To reduce reliance on self-report data, we also require participants to submit a photo of their device. All data are collected using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University). Incentives are US $10 Amazon gift codes delivered by mail to new participants and electronically to returning participants. Those lost to follow-up are replaced. Several strategies are applied to maximize the odds that participants who receive incentives are not bots and are likely to possess an e-cigarette (eg, required identity check and photo of a device). RESULTS: In total, 3 waves of data were collected between 2020 and 2021 (wave 1: n=1209; wave 2: n=1218; wave 3: n=1254). Retention from waves 1 to 2 was 51.94% (628/1209), and 37.55% (454/1209) of the wave 1 sample completed all 3 waves. These data were mostly generalizable to daily e-cigarette users in the United States, and poststratification weights were generated for future analyses. Our data offer a detailed examination of users' device features and specifications, liquid characteristics, and key behaviors, which can provide more insights into the benefits and unintended consequences of potential regulations. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to existing e-cigarette cohort studies, this study methodology has some advantages, including efficient recruitment of a lower-prevalence population and collection of detailed data relevant to tobacco regulatory science (eg, device wattage). The web-based nature of the study requires several bot- and fraudulent survey taker-related risk-mitigation strategies, which can be time-intensive. When these risks are addressed, web-based cohort studies can be successful. We will continue to explore methods for maximizing recruitment efficiency, data quality, and participant retention in subsequent waves.

The brands of nicotine pouch products with the largest market share are produced by tobacco companies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the marketing of 5 oral nicotine products sold by tobacco companies. METHODS: Internet, radio, television, print, and web-based display advertisements between January 2019 and March 2020 for 6 brands of nicotine pouches and lozenges were identified through commercially available marketing surveillance systems supplemented by a manual search of trade press and a review of brand websites. A total of 711 advertisements (122 unique) were analyzed to identify characteristics, themes, marketing strategies, and target audiences, and qualitatively compared by brand. All 5 brand websites were also analyzed. Coders examined the entirety of each advertisement or website for products, marketing claims, and features and recorded the presence or absence of 27 marketing claims and lifestyle elements. RESULTS: All 6 brands of nicotine pouch products spent a total of US $11.2 million on advertising in 2019, with the most (US $10.7 million) spent by the brand Velo, and 86.1% (n=105) of the unique advertisements were web-based. Of the 711 total nicotine pouch advertisements run in 2019, the 2 brands Velo (n=407, 57%) and ZYN (n=303, 42%) dominated. These brands also made the greatest number of advertising claims in general. These claims focused on novelty, modernity, and use in a variety of contexts, including urban contexts, workplaces, transportation, and leisure activities. Of the 122 unique advertisements, ZYN's most common claims were to be ""tobacco-free,"" featuring many flavors or varieties, and modern. Velo was the only brand to include urban contexts (n=14, 38.9% of advertisements) or freedom (n=8, 22.2%); Velo advertisements portrayed use in the workplace (n=15, 41.7%), bars or clubs (n=5, 13.9%), leisure activities (n=4, 11.1%), transportation (n=4, 11.1%), sports (n=3, 8.3%), cooking (n=2, 5.6%), and with alcohol (n=1, 2.8%). Velo and ZYN also included most of the images of people, including women and people of color. The 36 Velo ads included people in advertising in 77.8% (n=28) of advertisements, and of those advertisements with identifiable people, 40% (n=4) were young adults and 50% (n=5) were middle-aged. About one-third (n=11, 35.5%) of the 31 unique ZYN advertisements included people, and most identifiable models appeared to be young adults. Brands such as Rogue, Revel, Dryft, and on! focused mainly on product features. All nicotine pouch products made either tobacco-free, smoke-free, spit-free, or vape-free claims. The most common claim overall was ""tobacco-free,"" found in advertisements from Rogue (1/1, 100%), ZYN (30/31, 96.8%), Velo (19/36, 52.8%), and Dryft (1/3, 33.3%), but not Revel. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine pouches and lozenges may expand the nicotine market as tobacco-free claims alleviate concerns about health harms and advertising features a greater diversity of people and contexts than typical smokeless tobacco advertising. The market leaders and highest-spending brands, ZYN and Velo, included more lifestyle claims. Surveillance of nicotine pouch marketing and uptake, including influence on tobacco use behaviors, is necessary.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Scheduled smoking is a method of gradual reduction, preparing smokers to quit by systematically reducing cigarette consumption according to a predetermined schedule that increases the time between cigarette consumption. Gradual reduction may be preferred to abrupt quitting, but the efficacy of this cessation approach is unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aims, first, to evaluate the overall effectiveness of scheduled smoking alone, or in combination with precessation nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), versus standard NRT starting on the quit date with no prior smoking reduction and, second, to evaluate the impact of schedule compliance on the effectiveness of the intervention. METHODS: A total of 916 participants recruited from the Houston metropolitan area were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 3 groups: scheduled smoking plus a precessation nicotine patch (n=306, 33.4%), scheduled smoking only with no precessation patch (n=309, 33.7%), and enhanced usual care (n=301, 32.9%) control. The primary abstinence outcomes were carbon monoxide-verified, self-reported, 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 2 and 4 weeks after the quit date. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the intervention effect. Scheduled smoking was implemented using a handheld device for 3 weeks before quitting. This trial was not registered because data collection began before July 1, 2005. RESULTS: Results for the first aim showed no overall differences in abstinence among the 3 groups in both the unadjusted and adjusted models. However, the results for the second aim showed a clear effect on abstinence by schedule compliance at 2 and 4 weeks and 6 months after quitting (odds ratio [OR] 2.01, 95% CI 1.31-3.07), 4 weeks (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.05-2.38), and 6 months (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.04-2.64), with the differences at 2 and 4 weeks after quitting being the most robust. We also found that scheduled smoking was related to a reduction in nicotine withdrawal, negative affect, and craving when compared with the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Scheduled smoking, when combined with precessation use of NRT, can result in significantly higher abstinence rates than usual care (abrupt quitting with NRT), particularly in the early postquit phase (2 and 4 weeks after cessation) when smokers are compliant with the procedure. Scheduled smoking also produced a better overall quitting experience by reducing symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and craving, in comparison with usual care, which could encourage future quit attempts. Studies in this area should focus on the use of counseling or other methods to improve adherence.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Nicotine pouches (NPs) are smokeless, tobacco-free, oral products that may be beneficial as part of a THR strategy. OBJECTIVE: This 2-center, cross-sectional confinement study conducted in Denmark and Sweden aimed to determine whether biomarkers of exposure (BoEs) to tobacco toxicants and biomarkers of potential harm (BoPHs) in exclusive users of NPs show favorable differences compared with current smokers. METHODS: Participants were healthy NP users (target n=100) and current, former, or never smokers (target n=40 each), as confirmed by urinary cotinine and exhaled carbon monoxide concentrations. During a 24-hour confinement period, participants were asked to use their usual product (NP or cigarette) as normal, and BoEs and BoPHs were measured in blood and 24-hour urine samples, with compliance determined using anabasine, anatabine, and N-(2-cyanoethyl)valine. BoEs and BoPHs were compared between NP users and current, former, and never smokers. Urinary total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (BoE to nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone) and urinary 8-epi-prostaglandin F2α type III, exhaled nitric oxide, blood carboxyhemoglobin, white blood cell count, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (BoPHs) were evaluated as primary outcomes. Other measures included urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, forced expiratory volume, carotid intima-media thickness, self-reported quality of life, and oral health. RESULTS: The results of this study were received in mid-2022 and will be published in late 2022 to early 2023. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will provide information on toxicant exposure and biomarkers associated with the development of smoking-related diseases among users of NPs compared with smokers, as well as on the potential role of NPs in THR.

Conventional approaches cannot accurately, conveniently, and noninvasively determine e-cigarette puff topography in a natural use environment. Thus, novel technology-enabled systems that do not primarily rely on self-report mechanisms or intrusive measurements to monitor e-cigarette product use behaviors are highly desired. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore and demonstrate the feasibility of a novel puff recording electronic nicotine delivery system (PR-ENDS) device for measuring naturalistic puff topography and estimating nicotine consumption during the ad libitum use of products among smokers and vapers. METHODS: An ancillary data analysis based on a completed parent study was conducted. The parent study was a 1-way randomized controlled open-label puff topography and nicotine pharmacokinetic assessment carried out in 24 healthy adults (12 smokers and 12 vapers). Participants were assigned a randomized product use sequence of a PR-ENDS device within 5 site visits for both controlled and ad libitum product use sessions. Blood samples were obtained for plasma nicotine analysis, and questionnaires were administered at various time points. During the ad libitum use session, puff topography was measured using a Clinical Research Support System (CReSS) device as a benchmark, as well as the PR-ENDS device with a built-in puff recording feature. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in representative puff topography parameters (number of puffs, total puff duration, and average puff duration) between the PR-ENDS and CReSS devices at the populational level across different device powers, e-liquid nicotine strengths, and flavors. The nicotine consumption estimated by the PR-ENDS device suggested that this device can be employed as a convenient monitoring tool for estimating nicotine use without measuring e-liquid weight loss between puffs. The linear relationship between nicotine consumption estimated by the PR-ENDS device and the pharmacokinetic parameter AUCad lib (plasma concentration-time curve for 1-hour ad libitum use) substantiated the potential of using this device as a pragmatic, noninvasive, and convenient means for estimating nicotine intake in the human body without blood collection. CONCLUSIONS: The novel PR-ENDS device was feasible for assessing naturalistic puff topography and estimating nicotine consumption and intake in the human body during ad libitum use.

However, the use of e-cigarettes is not harm free and the long-term health effect of using e-cigarettes is yet to be established. Given the high prevalence of e-cigarette use across the globe and its potential health concerns, it is imperative to conduct actual use behavior assessments to better understand how e-cigarettes are being consumed in real-world conditions. However, with the currently available technologies, there is still a lack of noninvasive, noninterventional, and convenient instruments for the real-time and real-world use behavior monitoring of e-cigarette product use. Novel technology-based systems that do not primarily rely on self-report or intrusive measurements to monitor e-cigarette use behaviors are therefore highly desired. OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this study is to investigate the e-cigarette actual use behaviors in the real world via a novel puff recording electronic nicotine delivery system (PR-ENDS). Specifically, we aim to analyze and summarize the survey and PR-ENDS use data and to study the relationships and effects of different factors on these variables. METHODS: In real-world conditions, 61 enrolled UK e-cigarette users were instructed to use PR-ENDS as the primary source of nicotine with their selected e-liquids for at least 3 weeks (21 days). A baseline survey was conducted to collect information about participants' demographics and nicotine use history (cigarette and ENDS). The puff data (ie, puff number, puff duration for each puff, device power, e-liquid nicotine concentrations) were directly recorded by PR-ENDS and uploaded to the cloud for further analyses. The nicotine emission and nicotine consumption were estimated based on recorded puff data. RESULTS: Middle-aged adults with a nicotine history represented the major user profile during the PR-ENDS trial. A wide range of device power and e-liquid nicotine concentrations was applied and their combinations during actual use were found to be rather complex. Various puff parameters (ie, puff duration, puff number, nicotine emission) were assessed with contributing factors from device, e-liquid, and user nicotine history in different effect sizes. The real-time observation revealed substantial intra- and interindividual variabilities in PR-ENDS use behaviors. The use pattern of a quick adaptation followed by consistent product use was recognized for at least 3 weeks during actual use. CONCLUSIONS: The actual use behavior assessment of PR-ENDS was conducted as a proof-of-concept application. The complex interactions of product attributes and significant intra- and interindividual variabilities in e-cigarette use behaviors provided new insights of compensatory behavior, which can inspire future studies in the field of nicotine addiction and abuse liability behavior assessment.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In addition, smoking cessation medication adherence is often poor, thus, challenging the ability to evaluate medication efficacy. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of combined varenicline and oral NRT and smartphone medication reminders on pharmacotherapy adherence and smoking abstinence among adults enrolled in smoking cessation treatment. METHODS: A 2×2 factorial design was used. Participants (N=34) were randomized to (1) varenicline + oral NRT (VAR+NRT) or varenicline alone (VAR) and (2) smartphone medication reminder messages (REM) or no reminder messages (NREM) over 13 weeks. Participants assigned to VAR+REM received varenicline reminder prompts, and those assigned to VAR+NRT+REM also received reminders to use oral NRT. The other 2 groups (VAR+NREM and VAR+NRT+NREM) did not receive medication reminders. Participants were not blinded to intervention groups. All participants received tobacco cessation counseling. Smartphone assessments of smoking as well as varenicline and NRT use (if applicable) were prompted daily through the first 12 weeks after a scheduled quit date. Descriptive statistics were generated to characterize the relations between medication and reminder group assignments with daily smoking, daily varenicline adherence, and daily quantity of oral NRT used. Participants completed follow-up assessments for 26 weeks after the quit date. RESULTS: Participants were predominantly White (71%), and half were female (50%). On average, participants were 54.2 (SD 9.4) years of age, they smoked an average of 19.0 (SD 9.0) cigarettes per day and had smoked for 34.6 (SD 12.7) years. Descriptively, participants assigned to VAR+NRT reported more days of smoking abstinence compared to VAR (29.3 vs 26.3 days). Participants assigned to REM reported more days of smoking abstinence than those assigned to NREM (40.5 vs 21.8 days). Participants assigned to REM were adherent to varenicline on more days compared to those assigned to NREM (58.6 vs 40.5 days), and participants assigned to VAR were adherent to varenicline on more days than those assigned to VAR + NRT (50.7 vs 43.3 days). In the subsample of participants assigned to VAR+NRT, participants assigned to REM reported more days where ≥5 pieces of NRT were used than NREM (14.0 vs 7.4 days). Average overall medication adherence (assessed via the Medication Adherence Questionnaire) showed the same pattern as the daily smartphone-based adherence assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings indicated that smoking cessation interventions may benefit from incorporating medication reminders and combining varenicline with oral NRT, though combining medications may be associated with poorer adherence. Further study is warranted.

This ban undermined the products' appeal to vapers, so e-cigarette manufacturers added flavorants of other attractive flavors into tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes and reestablished appeal. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to analyze the impact of the addition of other flavorants in tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes on both human and public health issues and to propose further research as well as potential interventions. METHODS: Searches for relevant literature published between 2018 and 2023 were performed. Cited articles about the toxicity of e-cigarette chemicals included those published before 2018, and governmental websites and documents were also included for crucial information. RESULTS: Both the sales of e-cigarettes and posts on social media suggested that the manufacturers' strategy was successful. The reestablished appeal causes not only a public health issue but also threats to the health of individual vapers. Research has shown an increase in toxicity associated with the flavorants commonly used in flavored e-cigarettes, which are likely added to tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes based on tobacco-derived and synthetic tobacco-free nicotine, and these other flavors are associated with higher clinical symptoms not often induced solely by natural, traditional tobacco flavors. CONCLUSIONS: The additional health risks posed by the flavorants are pronounced even without considering the toxicological interactions of the different tobacco flavorants, and more research should be done to understand the health risks thoroughly and to take proper actions accordingly for the regulation of these emerging products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

OBJECTIVE: This multicenter, prospective, 3-parallel-arm randomized controlled trial will investigate whether switching from combustible cigarettes to C-F NA will lead to measurable improvements in oral health parameters and dental esthetics over 18 months in adult smokers with limited gum disease. METHODS: Regular smokers not intending to quit and without clinical signs of periodontitis will be randomly assigned (1:4 ratio) to either standard of care with brief cessation advice (control group; arm A) or C-F NA use (intervention group; arm B). The study will also include a reference group of never smokers (reference group; arm C). The primary end point is the change in the Modified Gingival Index (MGI) score from baseline between the control arm (arm A) and the intervention arm (arm B) at the 18-month follow-up. In addition, the study will analyze the within- and between-group (arms A, B, and C) changes in MGI assessment, plaque imaging, dental shade quantitation, tooth stain scores, and oral health-related quality of life questionnaires measured at each study time point. All participants will attend a total of 7 clinic visits: screening, enrollment, and randomization (visit 0); baseline visit-day 14 (visit 1); day 90 (visit 2); day 180 (visit 3); day 360 (visit 4); and day 540 (visit 5). This multicenter study will be conducted in 4 dental clinics in 4 countries. The statistical analysis will involve descriptive statistics for continuous and categorical data. Primary end points will undergo tests for normality and, based on distribution, either a 2-sided t test or Mann-Whitney U test. Linear mixed model with random factors center and study arms by center will also be applied. Secondary end points, including MGI assessment and quality of life, will be subjected to similar tests and comparisons. Only if one value of the parameter MGI is missing after day 1, the last available observation will be carried forward. The analysis will be performed on the substituted data. Secondary parameters will not have missing value replacement. RESULTS: Participant recruitment began in October 2021, and enrollment was completed in June 2023. Results will be reported in 2025. CONCLUSIONS: This will be the first study to provide key insights into oral health benefits or risks associated with using C-F NA in smokers who are seeking alternatives to cigarette smoking.

Our analysis showed that the specific characteristics of e-cigarette products as well as marketing strategies, especially social media marketing, fostered the spread of vaping and the subsequent effects on human health and toxicity. We analyzed the components of e-cigarette devices and e-liquids, including the latest variants whose impacts were often overlooked. The different forms of nicotine, including salts and freebase nicotine, tobacco-derived nicotine, tobacco-free nicotine, and cooling agents (WS3 and WS23), have brought more choices for vapers along with more ways for e-cigarette manufacturers to advertise false understandings and present a greater threat to vapers' health. Our work emphasized the products of brands that have gained significant influence recently, which are contributing to severe public health issues. On the other hand, we also discussed in detail the toxicity of e-liquid components and proposed a toxicity mechanism. We also noticed that nicotine and other chemicals in e-liquids promote each other's negative effects through the oxidative stress and inflammatory nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway, a mechanism leading to pulmonary symptoms and addiction. The impact of government regulations on the products themselves, including flavor bans or regulations, has been limited.

In October 2021, Vuse Solo became the first e-cigarette brand to receive marketing granted orders (MGOs) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), authorizing its marketing and their tobacco-flavored pods. Vuse Ciro and Vuse Vibe, and their tobacco-only (""original"") e-liquids, were authorized for marketing in May 2022 and Vuse Alto tobacco-flavored devices were authorized in July 2024. These marketing authorizations are contingent upon the company adhering to the MGOs' stated marketing restrictions, including reducing exposure and appeal to youth via digital, radio, television, print, and point-of-sale advertising. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we analyzed the official social media channels of Vuse (Instagram and Facebook) to examine how Vuse marketed its products on social media and whether these marketing posts contain potentially youth-appealing themes. METHODS: We conducted content analysis of the official RJ Reynolds Vapor Company Instagram and Facebook accounts. We collected all posts from October 10, 2019, when RJ Reynolds Vapor Company submitted its premarket tobacco product application to the FDA, to February 21, 2022, to cover the first winter holiday season after the MGO. Two coders developed the codebook with 17 themes based on the Content Appealing to Youth index to capture the posts' characteristics and potentially youth-appealing content. We calculated the percentage of posts in which each code was present. RESULTS: A total of 439 unique posts were identified. During this study's period, there were no posts on Instagram or Facebook marketing Vuse Solo (the authorized product at that time). Instead, Vuse Alto (unauthorized to date of study) was heavily marketed, with 59.5% (n=261) of the posts specifically mentioning the product name. Further, ""Vuse"" more generally was marketed on social media without differentiating between the authorized and unauthorized products (n=182, 41.5%). The marketing messages contained several potentially youth-appealing themes including creativity or innovation (n=189, 43.1%), individuality or freedom (n=106, 24.2%), and themes related to art (n=150, 34.2%), music (n=77, 17.5%), sports (n=125, 28.5%), nature (with n=49, 11.2% of the posts containing flora imageries), alcohol imagery (n=10, 2.3%), and technology (n=6, 1.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Although Vuse Alto e-cigarettes had not yet obtained FDA marketing authorization during the 28 months of data collection, they were the primary Vuse e-cigarette devices marketed on social media. Vuse social media posts use themes that are appealing to and likely promote youth use, including creativity and innovation, individuality or freedom, arts and music, nature, technology, and alcohol imagery. The FDA should (1) prohibit companies from comarketing unauthorized products alongside authorized products, and (2) exercise enforcement against even authorized products that are marketed using youth-appealing features.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

For adults who smoke cigarettes and cannot or will not quit smoking, smoke-free products, such as nicotine pouches, have been recognized as a potential alternative to smoking combusted cigarettes to reduce harm due to cigarette smoking. The role of flavors in these smoke-free products in tobacco harm reduction has not been fully understood. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the effect of flavors in on! nicotine pouch products (research products) in the reduction of cigarette smoking among adults who smoke cigarettes in their natural environment. METHODS: This study uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial design. Approximately 400 eligible adults who smoke cigarettes will be enrolled and randomized to have access to either the Original (unflavored) on! nicotine pouch product only or a complete flavor profile (ie, Berry, Cinnamon, Citrus, Coffee, Mint, Original, and Wintergreen) of on! nicotine pouch products. After 3 weeks, participants in the Original-only arm will be randomized again, with half remaining in the Original-only arm and half having access to the complete flavor profile for another 3 weeks. Primary outcomes are expired-air carbon monoxide (CO) levels. Secondary outcomes are self-reported cigarette consumption and CO-verified cigarette abstinence. RESULTS: Recruitment and data collection started in September 2023 and is projected to last until March 2025. We anticipate completing the data analysis in 2025. As of May 2024, we have enrolled 314 participants.

THS consists of a holder and specially designed tobacco sticks that are heated instead of burned to produce a nicotine-containing aerosol. THS was available in Atlanta, Georgia; Richmond, Virginia; Charlotte, North Carolina; the Northern Virginia region; and South Carolina before its market removal in November 2021. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe selected sociodemographic characteristics and self-reported health history of adults who used IQOS (AUIs), their tobacco use patterns (eg, tobacco use history, exclusive and dual-use, and switching from cigarette smoking), their risk perceptions of the product, and their understanding of MRTP messages. METHODS: The IQOS Cross-Sectional Postmarket Adult Consumer Study was a study of AUIs aged 21 years or older who were recruited from a consumer database via direct postal mail and emails. Participants completed the online survey between September and November 2021. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 645 current and 43 former AUIs who had used at least 100 tobacco sticks (considered established THS use) before the assessment. Of the 688 participants, 424 (61.6%) were male, 502 (73.0%) were non-Hispanic White, and the mean age was 45 years. The vast majority (680/688, 98.8%) of AUIs had ever smoked combusted cigarettes before first trying THS and 628 (91.3%) had smoked cigarettes in the 30 days before first using THS. At the time of assessment, 161 (23.4%) reported using e-cigarettes (vs 229, 33.3%, before THS use), 92 (13.4%) reported smoking cigars (vs 114, 16.6%, before THS use), and 338 (49.1%) were still smoking after an average of 1 year of THS use. Among those currently using THS who were still smoking (n=298), 249 (83.6%) smoked fewer cigarettes compared with before first trying THS; 362 of 688 (52.6%) AUIs reported having no physical health conditions evaluated in this study and almost three-quarters reported having no mental health conditions. Among all AUIs, over 563 (81.8%) had never used a cessation treatment or had not used it in the past 12 months, and 555 (80.7%) AUIs demonstrated a correct understanding of the MRTP message and AUIs perceived THS as having a lower risk than cigarettes (43.8 vs 64.4 on a 100-point composite score scale).

The initial attempt to collect survey data failed due to fraudulent survey submissions, likely submitted by survey bots and other survey takers. This paper chronicles the journey from that setback to the successful completion of 5 waves of data collection. The section ""Naïve Beginnings"" examines the study preparation phase, identifying the events, decisions, and assumptions that contributed to the failure (eg, allowing anonymous survey takers to submit surveys and overreliance on a third-party's proprietary fraud detection tool to identify participants attempting to submit multiple surveys). ""A 5-Alarm Fire and Subsequent Investigation"" summarizes the warning signs that suggested fraudulent survey submissions had compromised the data integrity after the initial survey launched (eg, an unanticipated acceleration in recruitment and a voicemail alleging fraudulent receipt of multiple gift codes). This section also covers the investigation process, along with conclusions regarding how the methodology was exploited (eg, clearing cookies and using virtual private networks) and the extent of the issue (ie, only 363/1624, 22.4% of the survey completions were likely valid). ""Building More Resilient Methodology"" details the vulnerabilities and threats that likely compromised the initial survey attempt (eg, anonymity and survey bots); the corresponding mitigation strategies and their benefits and limitations (eg, personal record verification platforms, IP address matching, virtual private network detection services, and CAPTCHA [Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart]); and the array of strategies that were implemented in future survey attempts. ""Staying Vigilant"" recounts the identification and management of an additional threat that emerged despite the implementation of an array of mitigation strategies, underscoring the need for ongoing vigilance and adaptability. While the precise nature of the threat remains unknown, the evidence suggested multiple fraudulent surveys were submitted by a single or connected entities, who likely did not possess e-cigarettes. To mitigate the chance of reoccurrence, participants were required to submit an authentic photo of their most used e-cigarette. Finally, in ""Reflection 4 Years Later,"" we share insights after completing 5 waves of data collection without additional threats or vulnerabilities uncovered that necessitated the application of further mitigation strategies. Reflections include reasons for confidence in the data's integrity, the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the study protocols, and the potential introduction of sampling bias through recruitment and mitigation strategies. By sharing our journey, we aim to provide valuable insights for researchers facing similar challenges with web-based surveys and those seeking to minimize such challenges a priori. Our experiences highlight the importance of proactive measures, continuous monitoring, and adaptive problem-solving to ensure the integrity of data collected from participants recruited from web-based platforms.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Influencers promote e-cigarettes using misleading relative harm claims, portraying them as safer than regular cigarettes while overstating benefits and selectively omitting information on the harms. To counter this, the US Federal Drug Administration requires influencers to include a nicotine warning label in their sponsored posts, similar to the ones used on e-cigarette packages. However, research on their effectiveness remains limited, leaving questions about when, how, and for whom these warnings work. OBJECTIVE: This study examined how (1) relative harm claims and (2) health warnings in influencers' sponsored e-cigarette content influence health outcome expectations and intentions to use e-cigarettes. In addition, we investigated whether user status (ie, smoking cigarettes or vaping e-cigarettes vs nonuse) moderates these effects. METHODS: Participants (n=597 age: mean 40.84, SD 11.93 years) were recruited through a survey company using a quote-based sample of German adults aged between 18 and 60 years, stratified by age, gender, and education. We conducted a preregistered 2 (relative harm claim: absent or present) × 2 (health warning: absent or present) between-subjects experiment. Participants viewed Instagram profiles of 2 influencers and separate posts including sponsored e-cigarette content. Relative harm claims in sponsored e-cigarette posts were manipulated by adding captions stating that e-cigarettes are healthier than cigarettes, with misleading information about why this could be the case. Neutral captions described product features in the relative harm claim absent condition. Health warnings appeared as a black text on a white background containing a nicotine warning statement. Participants then reported measures on attitudes, outcome expectations, intentions, and personal e-cigarette and cigarette use. Multivariate analysis of covariance and moderated mediation analyses were used to test the direct and interaction effects of misleading relative harm claims and health warnings. RESULTS: Misleading relative harm claims significantly influenced health outcome expectations (F1,551=5.88, P=.02, η2p=0.011), with participants exposed to harm claims about e-cigarettes reporting lower negative outcomes (mean 5.25, SD 0.09) compared to those who did not (mean 5.58, SD 0.10). Health warnings had no statistical significant effect on attitudes, health outcome expectations, or intentions. No interaction effect between health warnings and relative harm claims was observed. Overall user status (ie, cigarette or e-cigarette use vs nonuse) did not moderate these effects. CONCLUSIONS: Health warnings as mandated by the Federal Drug Administration were ineffective in reducing the persuasive impact of influencers' appealing e-cigarette content, regardless of an individual's own experiences with cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Policy makers should consider tailoring warnings that address audience-specific consequences to make them more effective. In addition, media literacy interventions are essential to counter misleading relative harm claims and appealing influencers' e-cigarette content.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze how THR is discussed on X (formerly known as Twitter), examining message valence toward THR (pro, anti, mixed, or none), stakeholder participation, geographic and temporal variation, and the involvement of industry and THR advocates. METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of 17,361 posts related to THR from 87 countries, published between July 2019 and December 2023. Thematic analysis was used to identify dominant narratives. RESULTS: Pro-THR posts comprised the majority (12,393/17,361, 71.4%), followed by anti-THR (3925/17,361, 22.6%) and neutral or mixed messages (63/17,361, 0.4%). Pro-THR messages were most prevalent in high-income countries (9193, 78.3%) and were primarily disseminated by THR advocates (7084/7426, 95.4%), tobacco users (3618/3692, 98%), and industry-affiliated accounts (973/1042, 93.3%). Anti-THR posts were more common among government entities (276/333, 82.9%), tobacco control advocates (256/364, 70.3%), and in lower-middle-income regions (149/244, 61.2%). Self-identified health care providers represented 9.4% (1629/17,361) of the dataset, with their posts nearly evenly split between pro-THR (716/1629, 44%) and anti-THR (826/1629, 50.7%) narratives. Pro-THR narratives emphasized the safety and smoking cessation potential of newer nicotine and tobacco products, consumer rights, and skepticism toward public health authorities. In contrast, anti-THR messages focused on youth protection, health risks of newer products, distrust of industry motives, and advocated for complete cessation of tobacco and nicotine use. Notably, 39.6% (6881/17,361) of THR-related posts mentioned newer products, and 15.7% (2724/17,361) included marketing efforts. There was a marked increase over time in overall THR-related post volume, posts by THR advocates, product mentions, and marketing attempts. Overall, high-income countries contributed the majority of posts (11,739/17,361, 67.6%) while nearly half originated from North America (8553/17,361, 49.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The online discourse surrounding THR is characterized by a predominance of pro-THR messaging, particularly in high-income countries and among industry-affiliated stakeholders. The growing volume of THR advocacy and marketing efforts on social media presents new challenges for tobacco regulation and public health policy.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Internet-based social support groups have the capability of connecting widely dispersed groups of people trying to quit smoking, making social support available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at minimal cost. However, to date there has been little research to guide development of this particular feature of Web-assisted tobacco interventions (WATIs). OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to compare the characteristics of smokers who post in an online smoking cessation support group with smokers who do not post, conduct a qualitative analysis of discussion board content, and determine the time it takes for new users to receive feedback from existing members or moderators. METHODS: Data were collected from StopSmokingCenter.net version 5.0, a WATI equipped with an online social support network moderated by trained program health educators that was operational from November 6, 2004, to May 15, 2007. Demographic and smoking characteristics for both users and nonusers of the online social support network were analyzed, and qualitative analyses were conducted to explore themes in message content. Posting patterns and their frequency were also analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, 16,764 individuals registered; of these, 70% (11,723) reported being American. The mean age of registrants was 38.9 years and 65% (10,965) were female. The mean number of cigarettes smoked was 20.6 per day. The mean score for the 41% (6849) of users who completed the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence was 5.6. Of all registered members, 15% (2562) made at least one post in the online social support network; 25% of first posts received a response from another member within 12 minutes, 50% within 29 minutes. The most frequent first posts were from recent quitters who were struggling with their quit attempts, and most responses were from members who had quit for a month or more. Differences in demographic and smoking characteristics between members who posted on the support group board at least once and those who did not post were statistically but not clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Peer responses to new users were rapid, indicating that online social support networks may be particularly beneficial to smokers requiring more immediate assistance with their cessation attempt. This function may be especially advantageous for relapse prevention. Accessing this kind of rapid in-person support from a professional would take an inordinate amount of time and money. Further research regarding the effectiveness of WATIs with online social support networks is required to better understand the contribution of this feature to cessation, for both active users (posters) and passive users (""lurkers"") alike.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of two Internet-based, computer-tailored smoking cessation programs. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial conducted in 2003-2004. Visitors to a smoking cessation website were randomly assigned to either an original online, interactive smoking cessation program or to a modified program. Both programs consisted of tailored, personalized counseling letters based on participants' characteristics, followed by monthly email reminders. The original program was based on psychological and addiction theory, and on preliminary research conducted in the same population. The modified program was shorter and contained more information on nicotine replacement therapy and nicotine dependence, and less information on health risks and coping strategies. In both programs, 1 month and 2 months after entering the study, participants were invited by email to answer the same tailoring questionnaire again in order to receive a second counseling letter. Participants in both programs obtained, on average, 1.2 feedback counseling letters over 2.5 months, and 84% received only 1 feedback letter. The outcome was self-reported smoking abstinence (no puff of tobacco in the previous 7 days), assessed 2.5 months after entry in the program. We report results from intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, where all non-respondents at follow-up were counted as smokers. RESULTS: The baseline questionnaire was answered by a total of 11969 current (74%) and former (26%) smokers, and the follow-up survey by 4237 people (35%). In an ITT analysis, abstinence rates in baseline current smokers were respectively 10.9% and 8.9% (odds ratio [OR]=1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.08-1.43, P=.003) in the original and modified programs, and 25.2% and 15.7% (OR=1.81, CI 1.51-2.16, P<.001) in baseline former smokers. While we found statistically significant differences in quit rates in smokers in the contemplation stage favoring the original program (OR=1.54, CI 1.18-2.02, P=.002), no between-group differences in quit rates were observed in smokers in the precontemplation (OR=1.07, CI 0.36-3.14, P=.91) and preparation (OR=1.15, CI 0.97-1.37, P=.10) stages of change. CONCLUSIONS: In smokers in the contemplation stage of change and in former smokers, the original program produced higher smoking abstinence rates than the modified program.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Many brands maintain retail websites that present e-cigarette marketing claims and sell directly to consumers. Understanding of the evolving composition of different types of e-cigarette brand websites is currently underdeveloped. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents how e-cigarette brand websites surveyed in 2013-2014 evolved by 2016-2017, and how the websites run by different types of e-cigarette producers currently differ. METHODS: In 2016-2017, we revisited 466 e-cigarette brand websites surveyed in 2013-2014, 288 of which were extant, and identified 145 new English-language websites. We compared product designs, marketing claims, and age-based warnings presented by types of e-cigarette producers: major tobacco companies, independent vape shops, and independent internet-only companies. RESULTS: Among the 433 websites examined in 2016-2017, 12 were owned by major tobacco companies, 162 operated a physical vape shop, and 259 were internet-only operations. Closed-system product designs were sold by 83% (10/12) of tobacco-owned brands. In comparison, 29.0% (47/162, P<.001) of vape shop and 55.2% (143/259, P=.06) of internet-only brands sold closed-system designs. Compared with vape shop and internet-only brands, tobacco-owned brands offered a smaller set of product models (P values <.001) and a narrower range of flavors (P values <.01), with greater emphasis on the traditional combustible cigarette flavors of tobacco and menthol (P values <.001). Tobacco-owned brands also offered a narrower range of nicotine options than the vape shops (P=.002) and were less likely to offer nicotine-free e-liquid compared with internet-only and vape shop brands (P values <.001). Finally, 83% (10/12) of tobacco-owned brand websites featured age verification pop-up windows. In comparison, only 50.2% (130/259) of internet-only brands (P=.01) and 60.5% (98/162) of vape shop brands (P=.06) featured age verification windows. Websites surveyed in both 2013-2014 and 2016-2017 became more likely to sell open-system mods (P<.001) and sold an increased number of product models (P<.001), flavors (P<.001), and nicotine options (P<.001). Prevalence of several types of claims decreased significantly, including indirect claims regarding smoking cessation (P<.001), claims regarding e-cigarettes as healthier (P<.001), less expensive (P<.001), and usable in more places (P<.001) compared with combustible cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: The number of e-cigarette brands has not appeared to increase since 2014, even as website messaging evolved, with brands owned by tobacco companies and vape shops pulling in opposite directions. Brands owned by tobacco companies offered a limited range of e-cigarette products, whereas brands owned by vape shops emphasized a panoply of flavor and nicotine options. Furthermore, the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory action may influence the types of e-cigarette products offered and the market shares of various companies.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Obstacles to smoking cessation include limited access and adherence to effective cessation interventions. Technology can help overcome these obstacles; many smartphone apps have been developed to aid smoking cessation, but few that conform to the US clinical practice guideline (USCPG) have been rigorously tested and reported in the literature. Clickotine is a novel smartphone app for smoking cessation, designed to deliver the essential features of the USCPG and engineered to engage smokers by personalizing intervention components. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the engagement, efficacy, and safety of Clickotine in an initial, single-arm study. Outcomes measured were indicators of engagement with the smartphone app (number of app opens, number of interactions with the Clickotine program, and weeks active with Clickotine), cessation outcomes of 7- and 30-day self-reported abstinence from smoking, and negative health events. METHODS: We recruited US residents between 18 and 65 years of age who owned an iPhone and smoked 5 or more cigarettes daily for the study via online advertising. Respondents were prescreened for eligibility by telephone and, if appropriate, directed to a Web portal to provide informed consent, confirm eligibility, and download the Clickotine app. Participants completed study assessments via the online portal at baseline and after 8 weeks. Data were collected in Amazon S3 with no manual data entry, and access to all data was maximally restrictive, logged, and auditable. RESULTS: A total of 416 participants downloaded the app and constituted the intention-to-treat (ITT) sample. On average, participants opened the Clickotine app 100.6 times during the 8-week study (median 69), logged 214.4 interactions with the Clickotine program (median 178), and remained engaged with Clickotine for 5.3 weeks (median 5). Among the ITT sample, 45.2% (188/416) reported 7-day abstinence and 26.2% (109/416) reported 30-day abstinence from smoking after 8 weeks. Completer analysis focused on 365 (87.7%) of the 416 enrolled participants who completed the 8-week questionnaire revealed that 51.5% (188/365) of completers reported 7-day abstinence and 29.9% (109/365) reported 30-day abstinence. Few adverse events, mostly consistent with nicotine withdrawal symptoms, were reported and overall no safety signal was detected. CONCLUSIONS: In this initial single-arm trial, Clickotine users appeared to demonstrate encouraging indicators of engagement in terms of the number of app opens, number of program interactions, and continued engagement over time. Clickotine users reported encouraging quit rates while reporting few adverse events. Future research is warranted to assess Clickotine's efficacy in a randomized controlled trial.

OBJECTIVE: To understand their potential implications for public health and to guide tobacco control efforts, we have used an infoveillance approach to identify new tobacco and tobacco-related products. METHODS: Our search for tobacco(-related) products consists of several tailored search profiles using combinations of keywords such as ""e-cigarette"" and ""new"" to extract information from almost 9000 preselected sources such as websites of online shops, tobacco manufacturers, and news sites. RESULTS: Developments in e-cigarette design characteristics show a trend toward customization by possibilities to adjust temperature and airflow, and by the large variety of flavors of e-liquids. Additionally, more e-cigarettes are equipped with personalized accessories, such as mobile phones, applications, and Bluetooth. Waterpipe products follow the trend toward electronic vaping. Various heat-not-burn products were reintroduced to the market. CONCLUSIONS: Our search for tobacco(-related) products was specific and timely, though advances in product development require ongoing optimization of the search strategy. Our results show a trend toward products resembling tobacco cigarettes vaporizers that can be adapted to the consumers' needs. Our search for tobacco(-related) products could aid in the assessment of the likelihood of new products to gain market share, as a possible health risk or as an indicator for the need on independent and reliable information of the product to the general public.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This pilot study examines self-reported oral health outcomes following the use of a novel nicotine pouch (Stingfree Strong Blue Mint), with an impermeable barrier on the interior side designed to reduce mucosal irritation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 23 Swedish dentists who were current snus or nicotine pouch users participated in a 5-week observational study. Baseline and follow-up assessments included self-reported oral health status and photographic documentation of mucosal conditions, reviewed by an independent blinded dental expert. Primary outcomes included changes in self-reported snus lesions, gingival recession, gingival irritation, and gingivitis. Results: The prevalence of self-reported snus lesions decreased from 95.7% (n = 22) to 69.6% (n = 16). Median Axell-scale lesion severity declined from 2 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1-3) to 1 (IQR: 0-2) (z = 3.756, p = 0.0002). Moderate-to-severe lesions (Axell score ≥ 3) dropped from 39.1% (n = 9) to 0% (n = 0). Self-reported gingivitis cases (n = 3) were eliminated, and gingival irritation decreased by 90.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings suggest that the use of the Stingfree Strong Blue Mint nicotine pouch may reduce mucosal irritation. While promising, these findings warrant validation through large randomised controlled trials to establish long-term effectiveness and safety.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Since heating yields less carbon monoxide and other tobacco pyrolysis-derived toxicants, tobacco companies claim that HNBs are less harmful than conventional cigarettes are. Although this hypothesis is plausible, no long-term clinical trials and/or observational studies are available to corroborate it. To overcome barriers to the entry of tobacco products to the market, manufacturers of HNBs argue that they are a new wave of harm reduction alternatives. Nonetheless, even if HNBs were in fact less harmful than conventional cigarettes, they would still have the potential to cause nicotine addiction (a major health hazard) and other harms to smokers' health. HNBs deliver nicotine, provide users a tobacco aroma and flavor and some rituals of smoking, and are supposedly safer than conventional cigarettes. Owing to these features, HNBs are likely to enhance smoking appeal and initiation among young persons and discourage smokers' attempts to quit. In other words, if HNBs were freely available on the market, they would increase the prevalence of smoking. However, HNBs may constitute a harm reduction alternative for nicotine-dependent smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit smoking. Given these facts, approval of HNBs for use under medical supervision (prescription only), along with strict restrictions on advertising, is a balanced regulatory option that would reconcile the therapeutic needs of nicotine-addicted patients with the public heath goal of achieving a smoke-free generation in the near future.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

South America became the first 100% smoke-free subregion in the Americas.,"Almost 20 years after the launching by the Pan American Health Organization of its ""Smoke-Free Americas"" initiative in 2001, in December 2020, South America became the first subregion in the Americas to accomplish 100% smoke-free environments in line with Article 8 of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Some of these countries adopted legal measures that are more robust than others, including in their laws specific outdoor places in the smoking ban (like Argentina and Uruguay) and/or novel nicotine and tobacco products under their scope (like Ecuador and Paraguay). The 10 countries took different paths to adopt this public health measure, either through executive or legislative measures or a combination of both. A few countries, like Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela, started at the subnational level and then moved on to the national level, similar to the rest of the countries. For achieving this milestone, an adequate context was crucial: the broad ratification of the FCTC and the relevance given to the human right to health, civil society efforts, commitments made by intergovernmental bodies, media and communication strategies, and the development of scientific evidence. Countries faced obstacles, including the well-known interference of the tobacco industry, which among other strategies used litigation; however, courts and judges upheld comprehensive legal measures on smoke-free environments. The process by which South America achieved this milestone represents a role model for other subregions of the Americas and the world.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: A cross-sectional study that analyzed a sample of 697 articles published between 2017 and 2020 regarding vaping. Information on the reporting of COI, type of COI (no conflict, conflict with the tobacco industry, pharmaceutical industry, or other), and country of publication were collected. To explore the association between reporting COI and having a positive result for vaping, two logistic regression models were fitted, both adjusted by country of publication. RESULTS: From 88 articles that reported COI, 23 reported COI with the tobacco industry, 44 with the pharmaceutical industry, and 21 reported another type of conflict. We found that reporting any type of COI increased by 4.7 times the odds (OR 4.70; 95% CI [2.89, 7.65]) of having a positive result for vaping. Additionally, compared to other countries, manuscripts published in England had 2 times higher odds (OR 2.40; 95% CI [1.16, 4.98]) of reporting a positive result for vaping. Reporting COI with the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries increased the odds of favorable results by 29 times (OR 29.95; 95% CI [9.84, 90.98]) and 2 times (OR 2.87; 95% CI [1.45, 5.69]), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In scientific articles, reporting COI and having positive results for vaping are highly associated.

METHODS: We analyzed industry websites, advocacy reports, news media and government documents related to NETNPs, focusing on electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products. We also conducted a survey of leading health advocates. We applied the policy dystopia model to analyze industry action and argument-based strategies on NETNP regulations. RESULTS: Industry actors engaged in four instrumental strategies to influence NETNP regulation - coalition management, information management, direct involvement in and access to the policy process, and litigation. Their actions included: lobbying key policy-makers, academics and vaping associations; providing grants to media groups to disseminate favorable NETNP information; participating in public consultations; presenting at public hearings; inserting industry-inspired language into draft NETNP legislation; and filing lawsuits to challenge NETNP bans. The industry disseminated its so-called harm reduction argument through large/influential countries (e.g., Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico). Industry discursive strategies claimed NETNPs were less harmful, provided safer alternatives, and should be regulated as so-called harm reduction products or have fewer restrictions on their sale and use than those currently in place. CONCLUSION: Our analysis provides a better understanding of industry strategies to undermine tobacco and nicotine control. To help counter industry efforts, health advocates should proactively strengthen government capacities and alert policy-makers to industry attempts to create new regulatory categories (so-called reduced-risk products), provide misleading information of government authorizations of NETNPs, and co-opt so-called harm-reduction messages that serve the industry's agenda.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: We analyzed public documents on new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products including news sources and national legislation and interviewed public health advocates in Latin America and the Caribbean. The policy dystopia model was used to assess health advocacy strategies for regulation of these products. RESULTS: Legislative activity on these products mostly occurred in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, Mexico, and Panama. Health advocates engaged in four action-based strategies to influence regulation of these products - coalition management, information management, direct involvement in and access to the policy process, and litigation. Health advocates concentrated on exposing industry deception and providing scientific evidence and country experiences. Health advocacy argument-based strategies exposed the increased use of new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products due to aggressive industry marketing. Advocates argued governments should comply with the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) obligations and its Conference of the Parties (COP) decisions to regulate these products. CONCLUSIONS: Applying the policy dystopia model on new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products provides a better understanding of how health advocates can pre-empt industry strategies to undermine WHO FCTC implementation. Unified transnational cooperative and coordinated health advocacy strategies to educate people can strengthen efforts. Promoting WHO FCTC obligations and COP decisions appears to support regulation on new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products and should be replicated elsewhere.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Although e-cigarettes are often perceived as less toxic than traditional cigarettes, they still pose significant health risks such as respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, potential neurodevelopmental effects in adolescents, and increased likelihood of transitioning to conventional tobacco products due to the presence of harmful chemicals and ingredients such as nicotine and other toxic substances. Adolescents in Pakistan have strong opinions about e-cigarette use, primarily influenced by sociocultural values; Westernization and globalization have made vaping appear to be a chic and sophisticated lifestyle choice. Moreover, views on addiction, dependency, and substance use are shaped by social backgrounds, religious beliefs, and cultural norms. Aggressive marketing techniques are employed by e-cigarette manufacturers, mainly targeting tech-savvy youth through digital platforms and social media influencers, which have also contributed to the rapid rise in e-cigarette use among young people in Pakistan. The current study underscores the necessity for culturally compatible interventions and policies, including educational programs, stringent regulations to limit access for young people, and comprehensive public health campaigns that counteract the influence of marketing by e-cigarette manufacturers. Additionally, healthcare providers should be trained to offer culturally sensitive cessation programs that support adolescents in quitting e-cigarettes and provide resources to mitigate the health hazards associated with e-cigarette use, including nicotine addiction and other adverse health effects, and to promote tobacco cessation in Pakistan.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

Results demonstrated that MSC had lower systemic exposures to many harmful and potentially harmful constituents than SMK, which is consistent with epidemiological data that indicate a differential in CVD risk between these groups.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

These assays were: Salmonella reverse mutation, mouse lymphoma, in vitro micronucleus, and cytotoxicity. Water extractions of each of the 5 products were tested using several different concentrations; the experimental SWS was also extracted using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Extraction procedures were verified by nicotine determinations. Results for SWS in the mutagenicity assays were broadly negative: there were occasional positive responses, but these were effectively at the highest concentration only (concentrations well above those suggested by regulatory guidelines), and were often associated with cytotoxicity. The 2S3 reference was unequivocally positive in one of the three conditions of the micronucleus assay (MNA), at the highest concentration only. Positive controls produced the expected responses in each assay. The SWS data are contrasted with data reported for combusted tobacco in the form of cigarettes, where strongly positive responses have been routinely reported for mutagenicity and cytotoxicity. These negative findings in a laboratory setting concur with the large amount of epidemiological data from Sweden, data showing that SWS are associated with considerably lower carcinogenic potential when compared with cigarettes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to assess the influence of TAPS on cigarette use and susceptibility to cigarette use among Nepalese adolescents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data (n=2,878) were drawn from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey for Nepal (GYTS, 2011). Channel-specific and cumulative TAPS exposure were the primary exposures of the study. Six multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to examine current and ever cigarette use outcome with exposure to TAPS. Six binary logistic regression analyses were applied to determine the susceptibility to cigarette use when exposed to TAPS. RESULTS: Channel-specific TAPS analyses show that indirect TAPS increases the odds of all the three outcomes; current cigarette use (OR=1.68, 95% CI=1.10-2.58), ever cigarette use (OR=1.81, 95% CI=1.23-2.65) and susceptibility to cigarette use (OR=1.65, 95% CI=1.25-2.19) after adjusting for the covariates. Television (TV) and movies exposure decreases the odds of susceptibility to cigarette use (OR=0.55, 95% CI=0.31-0.97). Cumulative TAPS analyses show that exposure to 5 sources of TAPS increases the odds of current cigarette use (OR=2.53, 95% CI=1.21-5.29). Being male increases the odds of all the three outcomes; current (OR=3.52, 95% CI=2.11-5.87), ever (OR=2.51, 95% CI=1.69-3.73) and susceptibility to cigarette use (OR=1.31, 95% CI=1.01-1.69). Social influence is likely to increase current (OR=6.47, 95% CI=2.50-16.74), ever (OR=1.79, 95% CI=1.10-2.93) and susceptibility to cigarette use (OR=1.66, 95% CI=1.25-2.21). CONCLUSION: Indirect TAPS exposure increased the current, ever, and susceptibility to cigarette use among Nepalese adolescents. Overall, the current use of cigarettes followed a dose-response relationship with TAPS exposure. The result implies a requirement of active surveillance of tobacco products and future research on adolescent-focused tobacco marketing in Nepal.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Instead, recent reports suggest that the tobacco industry targeted youth and sponsored research whose evidence was used to mislead policymaking. On August 28, 2018, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare's advisory banned the sale, purchase, and trade of ENDS. A survey was done in two waves. The first survey was done between August 10 and 25 2018 all websites which sold ENDS product were mapped and documented. The survey was repeated (November 30, 2018) were after the restriction to trade on ENDS was proposed by the Department of Customs. The two waves of survey found that no website, whether comprehensive e-commerce portals or dedicated ENDS marketing platforms fully complied with government orders. National and states government enforcement agencies are currently unaware of internet-based sale of ENDS. Although some states have given specific directions to stop the sale and delivery of ENDS within the state through e-commerce, there is limited monitoring and legal compliance by seller. Public health advocates need to stay vigilant and monitor the online sale and point of sale retail of ENDS to ensure strict compliance of national and state regulations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The marketing tactics of the industry have substantially increased the prevalence of e-cigarettes, use among adolescents. India banned e-cigarette in September 2019 that has been criticized by interested groups. We investigated that among adults and adolescents, who are more aware and using e-cigarette more? METHODS: The data were taken from a population-based representative household survey conducted in Mumbai and Kolkata in the year 2019-2020. A household was enrolled if it had a 12-14 year old adolescent living in it and both adolescent and adult caregivers agreed to participate in the survey. The data from 944 adolescents out of 15,436 enumerated in Mumbai and 1038 out of 24,284 enumerated in Kolkata and their caregivers were analyzed for awareness and ever use of e-cigarettes. Result: The awareness of e-cigarettes among 12-14 year olds in Mumbai was 15.5%, almost identical among boys and girls whereas is in Kolkata it was 11.2%. In contrast, among the adolescents' adult caregivers in Mumbai, the awareness was low, 3.9% and in Kolkata, 4.6%. Overall awareness was significantly higher among adolescents than among caregivers, especially among adolescent girls than among female caregivers in both cities. CONCLUSION: The awareness and the use of e-cigarette were very little and the messages from the e-cigarette industry seem to be targeted more towards adolescents than adults. The ban on an e-cigarette in India has helped in prevented the marketing of ENDS to adolescents.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Point-of-sale (POS) tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship (TAPS) are utilized by tobacco and nicotine product companies to attract new customers, including youth; POS TAPS are associated with youth tobacco susceptibility, experimentation, and current use. E-cigarettes and heated tobacco products (HTPs) are sold in the WPR, yet limited research exists on TAPS for these products. We examined POS cigarette, e-cigarette, and HTP sales and TAPS in Vietnam and the Philippines to understand current marketing strategies and assess compliance with existing regulations. Methods: An observational study was conducted in urban and rural areas of several cities in Vietnam and the Philippines. A walking protocol was employed to identify all cigarette, e-cigarette, and HTP retailers within 100m of schools (Vietnam: n=371; Philippines: n=353). To represent areas without sales restrictions, retailers within 100m of post-offices (Vietnam: n=325) or 100-200m from schools (the Philippines: n=353) were also observed. An observation form documented product displays, advertising, and promotion. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA were used for analyses. Results: Cigarette retailers were common in areas with sales restrictions (Vietnam: n=712, mean=1.9; Philippines: n=2070, mean 5.9) and without (Vietnam: n=751, mean=2.3; Philippines: n=4496, mean=12.7). E-cigarette (n=113) and HTP (n=123) retailers were found in the Philippines; fewer e-cigarette (n=12) and no HTP retailers were found in Vietnam. In areas without sales restrictions, compliance with TAPS regulations was low (Vietnam: 0%; Philippines: 0-10.8%). Marketing tactics varied across product types. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette sales and marketing are widespread in these two WPR countries; e-cigarettes and HTPs were also found. Compliance with sales and TAPS regulations is poor; stricter enforcement and more comprehensive regulations are recommended to prevent youth initiation. Other WPR countries may also consider monitoring, regulatory, and enforcement efforts to understand and limit youth initiation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DATA SOURCES: Major electronic databases were searched up to July 2006. REVIEW METHODS: Data from studies meeting the criteria were reviewed and analysed. A decision analytical model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of CDTQ from the NHS perspective. RESULTS: No systematic reviews of the effectiveness of CDTQ and no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) specifically addressing CDTQ were identified. Seven randomised placebo-controlled trials satisfied the inclusion criteria; six of these were industry sponsored. However, sustained smoking cessation was only reported as a secondary outcome in these trials and required commencement of cessation within the first 6 weeks of treatment. Meta-analyses of the study level results demonstrated statistically significant superiority of NRT compared with placebo. Individual patient data from unpublished reports of five RCTs were used to calculate sustained abstinence of at least 6 months starting at any time during the treatment period (generally 12 months). From this the meta-analysis indicated statistically significant superiority of NRT versus placebo [relative risk 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 3.15]. The proportions achieving this outcome across all five RCTs were 6.75% of participants in receipt of NRT and 3.29% of those receiving placebo. The number-needed-to-treat was 29. This measure of sustained abstinence was used for economic modelling. No existing economic analyses of CDTQ were identified. A de novo decision analytic model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of making CDTQ with NRT available for smokers unwilling or unable to attempt an abrupt quit. The outcome measure was expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The model results suggest that CDTQ with NRT delivers incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from around 1500 pounds/QALY to 7700 pounds/QALY depending on the age at which smoking cessation was achieved and the modes of CDTQ delivery. Assuming applicability to a single population, CDTQ was not cost-effective compared with abrupt quitting. If CDTQ with NRT were to be offered on the NHS as a matter of policy, the base-case results suggest that it would only be effective and cost-effective if a substantial majority of the people attempting CDTQ with NRT were those who would otherwise make no attempt to quit. This result is robust to considerable variation in the forms of CDTQ with NRT offered, and to the assumptions about QALY gained per quit success. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis of RCT evidence of quit rates in NRT-supported smoking reduction studies indicates that NRT is an effective intervention in achieving sustained smoking abstinence for smokers who declare unwillingness or inability to attempt an abrupt quit. The 12-month sustained abstinence success rate in this population (approximately 5.3% with NRT versus approximately 2.6% with placebo) is considerably less than that documented for an abrupt quit NRT regime in smokers willing to attempt an abrupt quit with NRT (which according to other systematic reviews is around 16% with NRT versus 10% with placebo). Most of the evidence of effectiveness of CDTQ came from trials that required considerable patient-investigator contact. Therefore, for CDTQ with NRT to generate similar abstinence rates for this recalcitrant population in a real-world setting would probably require a similar mode of delivery. The modelling undertaken, which was based on reasonable assumptions about costs, benefits and success rates, suggests that CDTQ is highly cost-effective compared with no quit attempt. CDTQ remains cost-effective if dilution from abrupt quitting forms a small proportion of CDTQ attempts. In an alternative analysis in which smokers who switch from an abrupt quit to CDTQ retain the success rate of abrupt quitters, all forms of CDTQ appear cost-effective. Randomised trials in recalcitrant smokers allowing head-to-head comparison of CDTQ delivered with various modalities would be informative.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The health hazards known to be caused by cigarette smoking and suspected to be related to chronic nicotine exposure are expected to be a hazard of habitual use of smokeless tobacco. A major concern in young males is accelerated coronary artery disease.

Nicotine is a powerfully addictive substance, and the tobacco industry spends billions annually promoting it in the United States. It is therefore important for clinicians to understand why people smoke, to address smoking in patients of all ages, and to lobby for health-preserving tobacco control policies at the community level. Children take up smoking in response to social influences: smoking by friends, parents, and family, and through exposure to smoking in media. Parents who smoke not only model the behavior, but also often make the product available by leaving cigarettes around the house. Media influences include the dollar 10 billion spent per year on tobacco marketing, but more importantly, the modeling of the behavior on screen by movie and television stars. Once children start smoking, many rapidly lose autonomy over the behavior. Youth can get hooked after smoking just a few cigarettes. The most effective community efforts for reducing tobacco use are: raising the price of tobacco; halting the sale of tobacco to minors; enforcing strict school tobacco policies; and making public places smoke free through local ordinances. Working with individuals, clinicians should support cessation in all smokers, including parents of children and adolescents. They should screen children for smoking risk factors beginning at age 10. They should teach parents to maintain smoke-free households, to set nonsmoking expectations early on, and to monitor adolescents for signs of smoking. Parents should limit exposure to adult media (e.g., R-rated movies) and use family television time to discuss the effect of seeing screen depictions of smoking on adolescent behavior. Adolescents who smoke should be assessed for signs of nicotine dependence and counseled about quitting. Clinicians are effective community voices; they should participate in efforts to raise tobacco taxes, limit the display of tobacco advertising, and make public places smoke free because of the adverse health effects of passive exposure to cigarette smoke.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Many researchers have favored exploring environmentally friendly and sustainable solutions to CCO (e.g, the application of (bio-) organic fertilizers). Therefore, to study the effects of functional organic fertilizers (FOFs) on tobacco CCO, we applied five types of fertilizers in a tobacco continuous cropping field with red soil (i.e., CF: tobacco-special chemical fertilizers; VOF: vermicompost-based FOF; HOF: humic acid-based FOF; WOF: wood biochar-based FOF; COF: compound FOF). The tobacco plant agronomic traits, leaf yield, economic value, and chemical quality (nicotine, total sugar, K2O, Cl contents, etc.) were evaluated via the continuous flow method. Meanwhile, we determined rhizosphere soil physicochemical properties, phenolic acids content, and bacterial community diversity by high-throughput sequencing. The results show that FOFs improved the tobacco plant agronomic traits, leaf yield (by 2.9-42.8%), value (by 1.2-47.4%), and chemical quality when compared with CF. More content of NH4 +-N, available P, and available K were discovered in the rhizosphere soil in VOF, HOF, and WOF. The rhizosphere sinapic acid and total phenolic acids content declined in the FOF treatments (1.23-1.56 and 7.95-8.43 mg kg-1 dry soil, respectively) versus those in the CF treatment (2.01 and 10.10 mg kg-1 dry soil, respectively). Moreover, the rhizosphere bacterial community structure changed under FOF functions: the beneficial microbes Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Streptomyces, and Bacillus increased, and the harmful microbes Acidobacteria and Gemmatimonadota decreased in abundance. There was a positive correlation between the tobacco leaf yield and soil NH4 +-N, TC content, and the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota. In summary, the application of VOF and WOF is a modest, practical, and environmentally friendly strategy to alleviate tobacco CCO from the standpoint of recycling solid waste.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

At the same time, the formation of aroma-active compounds during fermentation is essential for desirable flavor development. This study aimed to isolate a functional bacterial strain capable of accelerating nitrogen compound degradation and enhancing aroma quality through bioaugmented fermentation. METHODS: A total of 65 bacterial strains were isolated from naturally fermented cigar tobacco using a tobacco extract-based medium. Sixteen showed significant protease activity, and Bacillus altitudinis (CCTCC M20211370) was selected for further study. Laboratory- and industrial-scale fermentation trials were conducted with this strain. Volatile compounds were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), microbial community dynamics were assessed via high-throughput sequencing, and sensory evaluations were performed to assess quality improvements. RESULTS: Inoculation with Bacillus altitudinis significantly increased desirable aroma compounds such as neophytadiene and β-ionone, while reducing harmful compounds including nicotine and myosmine. The microbial structure was reshaped, with enrichment of beneficial genera like Bacillus and Oceanobacillus. Sensory analysis confirmed improved aroma complexity, featuring enhanced floral, honey-sweet, and resinous notes. DISCUSSION: Bacillus altitudinis effectively improved cigar tobacco quality by promoting nitrogen compound degradation and modulating microbial metabolism to enhance aroma development. These findings support its potential as a bioaugmentation agent in industrial cigar fermentation. Further genomic and enzymatic studies are warranted to elucidate its functional mechanisms and facilitate large-scale application.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This study investigates the puff-by-puff release patterns of key components in Natural Smoke Cigarettes (NSCs), which are designed to deliver nicotine without combustion by reducing oxygen content, utilizing a 30-s puff interval, a 2-s puff duration, and a 55 mL puff volume to simulate realistic smoking conditions. By establishing models to analyze the variation of nicotine, glycerol, 1,2-propylene glycol (PG), and water in different functional sections of the cigarette under controlled smoking conditions. These sections include the tobacco, hollow, cooling, and filter sections, constituting the structure of NSCs. In addition, the model calculates the port-by-port release of the components in the flue gas aerosol and compares it with the measured value. The results showed that: The retention amount in the tobacco section showed a steep decline in the first three puffs, with an overall exponential decrease. The amounts in the other sections were consistent, increasing in the first two puffs and then stabilizing. The retention amount decreased linearly with each puff, with a similar pattern across sections. The release amount peaked at the fourth to fifth puffs and then stabilized. The retention amount in the tobacco section declined exponentially in the first three puffs. It peaked in the second to third puffs in other sections, then decreased with each subsequent puff. The retention amount in the tobacco section showed a significant decline in the first puff, stabilizing at around 4 mg. In other sections, it peaked at the first puff and then rapidly declined. These findings can inform the development of reduced-harm smoking products and contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of smoke generation.

In September 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched an anti-vaping campaign, in U.S. high schools, on social media and other platforms, emphasizing ""The Real Cost"" of e-cigarettes. Using a novel deep learning approach, we assessed changes in vaping-related content on Instagram from 2017 to 2019 and drew an inference about the initial impact of the FDA's Real Cost campaign on Instagram. We collected 245,894 Instagram posts that used vaping-related hashtags (e.g., #vape, #ejuice) in four samples from 2017 to 2019. We compared the ""like"" count from these posts before and after the FDA campaign. We used deep learning image classification to analyze 49,655 Instagram image posts, separating images of men, women, and vaping devices. We also conducted text analysis and topic modeling to detect the common words and themes in the posted captions. Since September 2018, the FDA-sponsored hashtag #TheRealCost has been used about 50 times per month on Instagram, whereas vaping-related hashtags we tracked were used up to 10,000 times more often. Comparing the pre-intervention (2017, 2018) and post-intervention (2019) samples of vaping-related Instagram posts, we found a three-fold increase in the median ""like"" count (10 vs. 28) and a 6-fold increase in the proportion of posts with more than 100 likes (2 vs. 15%). Over 70% of Instagram vaping images featured e-juices and devices, with a growing number of images depicting a ""pod,"" the type of discrete vaping device that delivers high concentration of nicotine and is favored by novice e-cigarette users. In addition, the Instagram analytics data shared by the vaping influencers we interviewed showed underage Instagram users among their followers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We observed a decreasing trend in total soluble sugars, starch, total nitrogen, and nicotine levels as fermentation progressed. Notably, chemical components stabilized after T2 stages. The microbial community showed dynamic fluctuations, with alpha diversity indices (Shannon, ACE, Pielou's evenness, and Chao-2) reaching equilibrium at T2 and maintaining stability thereafter. Dominant genera such as Staphylococcus, Aspergillus, Sphingomonas, and Penicillium persisted throughout the fermentation process. A total of 1801 metabolites were identified, with 584 showing differential expression across the fermentation periods. Notably, comparisons between T0 and T1, T2, and T3 revealed 218, 377, and 419 differentially expressed metabolites, respectively. KEGG enrichment analysis identified 28 co-existing metabolic pathways, seven of which are linked to cigar quality formation. Furthermore, 29 out of 47 differential metabolites significantly correlated with the eight dominant microbial genera. These findings indicate that the T2 stage achieves optimal balance between microbial activity and metabolite stabilization, providing a scientific basis for industrial process optimization.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Despite being marketed as safe by the tobacco industry, the notable absence of regulation in their composition is evident. Both the generated fluids and aerosol exhibit a wide variety of substances that are not yet fully identified. In addition to additives, the aerosol contains metals, the presence of which can be attributed to the excessive heating of metallic filaments used in vaporizing the liquid. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to identify and describe studies that have assessed metal levels in biological samples obtained from electronic cigarette users and those exposed to their second-hand aerosol. This involved detailing the types and concentrations of metals identified and the biological samples in which the metals were detected. METHODS: Two independent researchers conducted searches in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to identify studies that measured the metal levels in human non-invasive biological samples from electronic cigarette users and second-hand exposure. Data were presented as a narrative review. RESULTS: In total, 18 articles were included in this review. Overall active and passive exposure to ENDS was related to higher levels of many metals, including lead and cadmium, in biological samples. ENDS users, in general, have lower metal concentrations in biological samples compared to the users of combustible cigarettes. CONCLUSION: The exposure to primary and second-hand e-cigarette aerosol is related to higher metal concentrations in the biological samples. The adverse effects of this exposure on long-term users are yet to be determined.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Fungi are known to have the capacity to convert nicotine to nornicotine. However, an endophytic fungal community of ""cherry-red"" tobacco has never been reported to our best knowledge. Here, we sampled mature leaves from both ""cherry-red"" and ordinary tobacco at lower, center, and upper plant sections, and we analyzed the ITS diversity using high-throughput sequencing. Results revealed a significantly different fungal community of foliar endophyte in ""cherry-red"" and ordinary tobacco. In comparison to the ordinary control, higher diversity and a co-occurrence network complex were found in ""cherry-red"" samples, especially in the center and upper leaves, where the red dapples mainly emerged. More taxa were enriched in the ""cherry-red"" than ordinary tobacco leaves at all plant sections. In particular, Aspergillus, some strains of which are reported capable of converting nicotine to nornicotine, was specifically enriched in upper ""cherry-red"" tobacco leaves, which showed most red dapples after curing. A less robust network structure was detected in the ""cherry-red"" tobacco compared to ordinary tobacco. The nearest taxon index (NTI) and β NTI indicated that the local community structuration of tobacco endophytic fungi mainly driven by deterministic process, while the community turnover among plant sections was stochastic. In conclusion, our study provides the earliest information of endophytic fungal community in ""cherry-red"" tobacco leaf, and the community diversity, composition, and network features are synchronously varied with the appearance of red dapples, which is suggestive of their relationship to the formation of ""cherry-red"" tobacco.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Our current understanding on cigar fermentation is far from thorough. This work employed both high-throughput sequencing and chromatography-mass spectrometric technologies to provide new scientific reference for this specific fermented system. Typical cigar samples from different regions (the Caribbeans, South America, East Asia, and Southeast Asia) were investigated. The results show that Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota were the predominant phyla in the cigar samples. Rather than the fungal community, it was the bacterial community structures that played vital roles to differentiate the cigar from different regions: Staphylococcus was the dominant genus in the Americas; Bacillus was the dominant genus in Southeast Asia; while in East Asia, there was no dominant genus. Such differences in community structure then affected the microflora metabolism. The correlation between microbiota and metabolites revealed that Aspergillaceae, Cercospora, and Staphylococcus were significantly correlated with sclareolide; Bacillus were positively associated with isophorone. Alcaligenaceae was significantly and positively correlated with L-nicotine and hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester.

Green manure is an essential organic fertilizer that alleviates obstacles to continuous cultivation. However, the plant-soil microecological effects of green manure on flue-cured tobacco cultivation remain unclear. Thus, a positioning trail including two treatments, chemical fertilizer application only (treatment NPK) and chemical fertilizer application with turning ryegrass (treatment NPKG) was conducted, and the effect of ryegrass returning on the soil physicochemical properties, soil microbiome, crop yield, and quality of flue-cured tobacco in continuous cropping soil were investigated. Results showed that returning ryegrass to the field increased the thickness of soil humus layer from 13 cm to 15 cm, reduced the humus layer soil bulk density to 1.29 cm3/g. Ryegrass tilled and returned to the field increased soil organic matter content by 6.89-7.92%, increased rhizosphere soil available phosphorus content by 2.22-17.96%, and converted the soil non-exchangeable potassium into potassium that was available for plant absorption and utilization. Ryegrass tilling and returning to the field increased the potassium content of middle leaves of flue-cured tobacco by 7.69-10.07%, the increased potassium content in flue-cured tobacco was accompanied by increased total sugar, reducing sugar, and the ratio of reducing sugar to nicotine, which facilitated the harmonization of the chemical composition of cured tobacco leaves. Moreover, the increased number of markedly improved operational taxonomic units enhanced the complexity of the soil bacterial community and its compactness after ryegrass tillage and their return to the field. The available potassium, available phosphorus, total potassium content, pH, and sampling period of the rhizosphere soil had considerable effects on the rhizosphere microbial. Ryegrass tilling and returning to the field changed the soil microbiome, which increased the abundance of bulk soil Proteobacteria, rhizosphere soil Fibrobacterota, and microbes with anti-pathogen activity (Lysobacteria, Sphingomonas, Chaetomium, and Minimedusa); and reduced the abundance of pathogenic fungi Neocosmospore genus in the soil. In brief, ryegrass returned to the field, improved soil microecology and restored soil nutrients, and established a new dynamic balance of soil ecology, thereby improving the quality of cultivated land and the quality of flue-cured tobacco.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

METHODS: A novel microbial fermentation medium produced by an edible medicinal fungus, Tremella aurantialba SCT-F3 (CGMCC No.23831) was used to improve the quality of cigar filler leaves (CFLs). Changes in sensory quality, chemical components, volatile flavor compounds (VFCs), and the structure and function of microbes were investigated during the fermentation process. RESULTS: The sensory quality of CFLs supplemented with the T. aurantialba SCT-F3 fermentation medium significantly improved. Adding the fermentation medium increased the total alkaloid, reducing sugar, total sugar, and 12 VFCs significantly. A total of 31 microbial genera were significantly enriched, which increased the microbial community's richness and diversity. Microbial functions increased, including nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis, nicotine degradation, and nicotinate degradation. During fermentation, the total alkaloid, reducing sugar, and total sugar content decreased. The richness and diversity of the microbial community decreased, whereas bacterial enzyme activity increased. At the end of fermentation, the sensory quality was excellent. The microbial structure gradually stabilized, and functional genes were low. The contents of the four Maillard reaction products and three nicotine degradation products increased significantly. 2-Ethyl-6-methylpyrazine, methylpyrazine, D,L-anatabine, β-nicotyrine, nicotinic degradation products, and total nitrogen were significantly and positively correlated with sensory quality. Methylpyrazine, D,L-anatabine, and β-nicotyrine were negatively correlated with Luteimonas, Mitochondria, Paracoccus, Stemphylium, and Stenotrophomonas. CONCLUSION: This research provides not only a new microbial fermentation medium that utilizes edible and medicinal fungi to improve the quality of fermented CFLs, but also new ideas for the development and application of other edible medicinal fungi to improve the quality of cigar tobacco leaves.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The AC environment is relatively mild, contributing to a diverse microbiome. Fungi are important components of the tobacco and environmental microbiota. However, our understanding of the composition and function of fungal communities in AC remains limited. METHODS: In this study, changes in the chemical constituents and fungal community composition of cigar tobacco leaves during AC were evaluated using flow analysis and high-throughput sequencing. RESULTS: The moisture, water-soluble sugar, starch, total nitrogen, and protein contents of tobacco leaves exhibited decreasing trends, whereas nicotine showed an initial increase, followed by a decline. As determined by high-throughput sequencing, fungal taxa differed among all stages of AC. Functional prediction showed that saprophytic fungi were the most prevalent type during the AC process and that the chemical composition of tobacco leaves is significantly correlated with saprophytic fungi. CONCLUSION: This study provides a deeper understanding of the dynamic changes in fungal communities during the AC process in cigar tobacco leaves and offers theoretical guidance for the application of microorganisms during the AC process.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, comparative studies examining the microbiome-aroma nexus across major cigar-producing regions remain limited. METHODS: We integrated high-throughput metagenomic sequencing with volatile organic compound (VOC) profiling to investigate microbial community structure and aroma compounds in four Yunnan cigars and two Cuban cigars. RESULTS: Bacillus spp. was consistently dominant across all samples, while Yunnan cigars exhibited higher microbial diversity. A total of 121 VOCs were detected, with nicotine, ylangene, δ-elemene, (R,S)-anatabine, and phenethyl alcohol identified as key aroma components. Nicotine, accounting for 29.7-55.0% of total VOC content, was positively correlated with Enterobacter and Escherichia, and negatively with Corynebacterium and Brachybacterium. Ylangene showed strong positive associations with Brachybacterium and Yaniella. After FDR correction, 26 differential VOCs were identified across cigar groups. KEGG pathway analysis revealed functional enrichment in carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. Principal component analysis indicated that the aroma complexity of certain Yunnan cigars, particularly YX4, approached that of Cuban cigars. DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate that region-specific fermentation microbiota are intricately linked to the production of key VOCs. This work provides a scientific framework for optimizing cigar fermentation through microbial regulation and supports the potential for targeted microbial inoculation to enhance sensory quality and global competitiveness.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This document sets out the ten recommendations of the European Academy of Paediatrics (EAP) with regard to e-cigarettes and children and young people (CYP). The EAP notes that nicotine is itself a drug of addiction, with toxicity to the foetus, child and adult, and were ENDS only to contain nicotine, their use to create a new generation of addicts would be rigorously opposed. However, e-cigarettes include numerous unregulated chemicals, including known carcinogens, whose acute and long term toxicities are unknown. The EAP asserts that there is incontrovertible evidence that the acute toxicity of e-cigarettes is greater than that of ""traditional"" tobacco smoking, and a variety of acute pulmonary toxicities, including acute lung injuries, have been recorded due to e-cigarettes usage. The chronic toxicity of e-cigarettes is unknown, but given the greater acute toxicity compared to tobacco, the EAP cannot assume that e-cigarettes are safer in the long term. The high uptake of e-cigarettes by CYP, including under-age children, is partly fuelled by deceitful marketing and internet exposure, which is also unregulated. Although proposed as aids to smoking cessation, there is no evidence that e-cigarettes add anything to standard smoking cessation strategies. In summary, the EAP regards these devices and liquids as very dangerous, and ineluctably opposed to their use, and their direct or indirect marketing.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

The insular cortex has been identified by preclinical and clinical studies as a critical target for addiction treatment. Insula functions can be modulated non-invasively using brain stimulation. It is unknown if deep repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the insula can improve smoking cessation of smokers trying to quit using varenicline. Methods: This will be a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial with 50 nicotine dependent smokers looking to quit. They will be randomly assigned to receive either active (10 Hz) or sham insula deep rTMS. Deep rTMS will be administered for 4 weeks (5 days/week). All participants will receive open label varenicline for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the 7-day point prevalence abstinence at the end of 12 weeks. The secondary outcomes will be Fagerström Test of Nicotine Dependence, Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale, Tiffany Questionnaire of Smoking Urges, expired carbon monoxide measurements, cigarettes smoked per day, point prevalence abstinence at end of 4 weeks, prolonged and continuous abstinence at 6 months. The measures will be collected throughout the 3-month treatment period as well as at the 6-month follow up. Discussion: This trial will test for the first time the impact of deep insula rTMS on smoking cessation in smokers treated with varenicline. This trial will use an H-coil specific to the insula, while previous studies have targeted both the insula and prefrontal cortex. This trial will inform on the utility to combine insula deep rTMS with varenicline to improve smoking abstinence rates.

It remains unclear how these hormone signals are integrated to regulate nicotine synthesis. Here we isolated a transcription factor NtWRKY-R1 from the group IIe of WRKY family and it had strong negative correlation with the expression of putrescine N-methyltransferase, the key enzyme of nicotine synthesis pathway. NtWRKY-R1 was specifically and highly expressed in tobacco roots, and it contains two transcriptional activity domains in the N- and C-terminal. The promoter region of NtWRKY-R1 contains two cis-elements which are responding to JA and auxin signals, respectively. Deletion of NtWRKY-R1 promoter showed that JA and auxin signals were subdued by NtWRKY-R1, and the expression of NtWRKY-R1 was more sensitive to auxin than JA. Furthermore, Yeast two-hybrid experiment demonstrated that NtWRKY-R1 can interact with the actin-binding protein. Our data showed that the intensity of JA and auxin signals can be translated into the expression of NtWRKY-R1, which regulates the balance of actin polymerization and depolymerization through binding actin-binding protein, and then regulates the expression of genes related to nicotine synthesis.

Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a widely used technique for rapid, non-destructive, and environmentally friendly analysis of nicotine levels in tobacco. In this paper, we propose a novel regression model, Lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), for predicting nicotine content in tobacco leaves using one-dimensional (1D) NIR spectral data and a deep learning approach with convolutional neural network (CNN). This study employed Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing to preprocess NIR spectra and randomly generate representative training and test datasets. Batch normalization was used in network regularization to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the Lightweight 1D-CNN model under a limited training dataset. The network structure of this CNN model consists of four convolutional layers to extract high-level features from the input data. The output of these layers is then fed into a fully connected layer, which uses a linear activation function to output the predicted numerical value of nicotine. After the comparison of the performance of multiple regression models, including support vector regression (SVR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), 1D-CNN, and Lightweight 1D-CNN, under the preprocessing method of SG smoothing, we found that the Lightweight 1D-CNN regression model with batch normalization achieved root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.14, coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0.95, and residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 5.09. These results demonstrate that the Lightweight 1D-CNN model is objective and robust and outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, which has the potential to significantly improve quality control processes in the tobacco industry by accurately and rapidly analyzing the nicotine content.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Intercropping, as a specific and efficient cropping pattern, is highly associated with the enhancement of soil quality and land-use efficiency. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.)- Isatis (Isatis tinctoria L.) intercropping can significantly alleviate pests and diseases, and improve soil potential and fertility in tobacco fields. In this study, comparative analysis of three different tobacco-Isatis intercropping (B2, B3, B4) and tobacco monocropping (B1) on the soil nutrients, enzyme activities, and microbial community were conducted. B2, B3, and B4 importantly increased the contents of organic matter, available potassium, and available phosphorus content of the soil by 17.38%, 7.76%, and 2.78%, respectively. Moreover, B2 enhanced the activities of sucrase, urease, and catalase of soil by 2.35 times, 3.16 times, and 4.47 times, respectively, and B3 enhanced the activities of sucrase, urease, and catalase of soil by 2.74 times, 3.22 times, and 3.11 times, respectively. The intercropping pattern also optimized the structure of the soil microbial community. The relative abundances of Acidobacteriota, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadota, Planctomycetota, Nitrospirota, and Verrucomicrobiota in B3 and B4 were higher than those in B1. Positive links in soil bacterial correlation networks accounted for 47%, and soil bacteria formed a highly interactive and complex network. And compared with the B1, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were lower abundance in B2 and B4, Ascomycota were lower abundance in B3 and Mortierellomycota were lower abundance in B2 and B3. Compared with monocropping, the chemical composition of tobacco leaves was harmoniously improved and the total production value of tobacco fields was significantly higher. The content of reducing sugar, total sugar, nicotine, potassium, and two-sugar ratio of leaves were increased after intercropping. The proportion of top-grade tobacco leaves after roasting in B2, B3, and B4 treatments were increased by 8.19%, 16.74%, and 27.32%, respectively.

Notably, nonivamide varied markedly across treatments, suggesting its potential as a key curing indicator. NC_68°C displayed 11 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated unique DEMs, differing from EC_68°C and IC_68°C, suggesting their potential availability in evaluating tobacco leaf quality. KEGG pathway analysis revealed temporal shifts in metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis (such as flavonoids, flavones, flavonols) and amino acid metabolism, during the transition from yellowing to color-fixing. Correlation analysis isolated the top 25 DEMs correlated with curing degree and stage, which might play pivotal roles in the curing process and could serve as potential biomarkers for assessing curing degree and stage. Specifically, D-(+)-cellobiose displayed the strongest negative correlation with curing degree, while 5,7-dihydroxychromone exhibited the highest positive correlation coefficient. Furthermore, curcurbitacin IIa showed the highest positive correlation with curing stage, followed by hesperetin and 8-shogaol. Additionally, random forest analysis emphasized morellic acid as a core molecular metabolite across curing degrees, suggesting its potential as a biomarker. Debiased sparse partial correlation (DSPC) network analysis further pinpointed hispidulin as a key metabolite, underscoring its significance in elucidating flavonoid metabolism during the curing process. Collectively, this study enhances the understanding of metabolite transformations underlying tobacco curing processes and provides a valuable reference for optimizing curing strategies to achieve desired outcomes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, the differences in aroma characteristics and the mechanisms of key aroma compound synthesis have not been fully elucidated. This study collected filler tobacco leaves (FTLs) from 5 representative domestic and international production regions. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified aroma compounds, an aroma wheel was established based on odor activity values (OAV), and principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) revealed major differences. Synthesis pathways of key differential components were further explored using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). In this study, 56 aroma compounds were identified in FTLs. Imported-FTLs (IMP-FTLs) contained higher levels of ketones and esters, along with moderate nicotine content, and exhibited a more noticeable sour and woody aroma. In contrast, Domestic-FTLs (DOM-FTLs) had a greater distribution of aldehydes, phenols, and neophytadiene, presenting a more prominent bean, burnt-sweet, and floral aroma. Nine compounds, including sclareol, 5-methylfurfural, and (E)-5-isopropyl-8-methylnona-6,8-dien-2-one, were identified as key differential components, and their synthesis primarily involves pathways such as phenylalanine metabolism and carotenoid biosynthesis. These findings provided a novel perspective on the targeted enhancement of key aroma compounds, which was significant for improving the aroma quality of filler tobacco leaves.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Applying organic-inorganic fertilizer is a key strategy for boosting tobacco yield and quality. This meta-analysis examines 632 observations from 169 articles to determine the precise influence of organic-inorganic fertilizer on tobacco. It evaluates the effects of different tobacco types and fertilizer compositions on yield and quality after fertilizer application. The application of organic-inorganic fertilizer significantly increased the yield (3.4%), but it mainly improved the balance of chemical composition and enhance the quality of tobacco (high-grade tobacco, 10.3%; reducing sugar content, 5.5%; nicotine content, -5.6%). The Y85 and Y87 varieties showed the most positive response to fertilization, with yield increases of 5.59% and 5.82%, respectively, and high-grade tobacco leaf rates increased by 14.92% and 11.04%, respectively. Fertilizers with a low organic nitrogen ratio (15%-30%) are more effective for increasing yield, while those with a medium to high ratio (50%-60%) improve tobacco's chemical quality. The application of organic-inorganic fertilizer balanced the nutrient distribution within the tobacco plants, leading to simultaneous increases in both yield and quality. This study quantitatively assessed the effects of organic-inorganic fertilizer on the yield and quality of tobacco and provides a solid theoretical foundation for the scientific and high-quality application of organic-inorganic fertilizer in various tobacco cultivation areas.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, the mechanisms by which topping influences photosynthesis and the leaf structure, and regulation of chemical composition remain unclear. This study investigated the regulatory mechanisms of different topping periods (buttoning, budding, first flower, and full flower topping and without topping) on photosynthesis, the leaf structure, and the chemical composition in tobacco by integrating photosynthetic physiology, anatomical, and chemical composition analyses. The results indicated that topping makes the leaves thinner, promotes leaf lamina opening, and results in thicker mesophyll, compact palisade tissue, and loose spongy tissue. It can also significantly enhance photosynthetic capacity. The contents of total sugar, reducing sugar, and K2O content increased significantly, while the content of chloride ions decreased significantly. The contents of total nitrogen and nicotine were moderate. In conclusion, topping promotes leaf lamina opening, enhances photosynthesis, and associated with changes in the chemical composition of tobacco leaves. Additionally, this study aims to provide a theoretical basis for the promotion of tobacco topping techniques.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, the complex field environment and uneven vertical distribution pose significant challenges for precise estimation. This study proposed a spectral and texture feature fusion method based on deep learning to improve estimation accuracy, and an improved YOLOv8 model (AO-YOLOv8) was developed for tobacco leaf instance segmentation. After segmentation, the average spectral features from six image channels were extracted, and 474 texture features were obtained using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Fourier Transform, Gabor Filter, and Wavelet Transform. Four deep neural networks, including LSTM, RNN, MLP, and FCNN, were then applied to establish estimation models of nitrogen and nicotine content at both the leaf and plant scales. The results showed that AO-YOLOv8 achieved an mAP50 of 87.3 and an mIoU of 83.4 in the leaf instance segmentation task, representing improvements of 6.99% and 8.88% over the original YOLOv8, and effectively detected and separated overlapping leaves under complex conditions. The fusion of spectral and texture features significantly improved prediction accuracy, with the LSTM network achieving the best performance, yielding R2 values of 0.8634 and 0.8735 for nitrogen and nicotine prediction at the leaf scale in laboratory conditions. In the field environment, the LSTM-based models for plant-scale nitrogen and nicotine estimation achieved R2 values of 0.6771 and 0.5735, respectively, which outperformed models using spectral features alone. In conclusion, this study enabled accurate estimation and visualization of the vertical distribution of nitrogen and nicotine content in field-grown tobacco plants, providing an efficient, low-cost, and non-destructive solution for tobacco production and quality control.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, the analysis of cigar smoke was lack. In this research, a total of 235 volatile compounds were identified by GC×GC-TOFMS in cigar smoke from Yuxi, Dehong and Pu'er regions of Yunnan, including 72 alkenes, 47 aromatic hydrocarbons, 42 heterocyclics, 28 ketones, 8 alcohols, 4 aldehydes, 3 esters, 13 phenols, 5 acetonitrile and 13 others. ROAV analysis indicated that o-cresol, guaiacol, 2,6-dimethyl-phenol, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene, (E,E)-2,4-hexadienal, butylbenzene, naphthalene, nicotine and D-limonene might be the key flavor compounds.

Nitrogen (N) management is a crucial agronomic approach for enhancing leaf quality and curing attributes; however, its specific role under chilling stress conditions remains poorly understood. METHODS: Field demonstrations employed 'Honghuadajinyuan' tobacco cultivar under varying N fertilization rates, i.e., T1 (18.9 kg N ha-1), T2 (27 kg N ha-1, conventional rate), and T3 (35.1 kg N ha-1) with uniform basal application of 15,000 kg ha⁻¹ composted farmyard manure. This study evaluated the quality characteristics of fresh and cured tobacco leaves, as well as the curing process, by integrating physical and chemical analysis with multivariate statistical approaches, including principal component analysis and multiple linear stepwise regressions. RESULTS: Fresh tobacco quality, such as leaf tissue integrity, chloroplast pigment content, and antioxidant enzyme activities as well as curing characteristics (leaf moisture regulation capacity, pigment conversion efficiency, and antioxidant system stability) exhibited gradient pattern of T3 > T2 > T1, respectively. This trend was also reflected in carbon-nitrogen metabolic accumulation, economic traits, and sensory quality of cured tobacco leaves. T3 treatment application enhanced tobacco yield (7.35%) and economic value (43.97%) as compared to T2 treatment. Principal component analysis and multiple linear stepwise regressions revealed covariance structures among economic traits, sensory quality, and principal components F1 and F2 (R2=0.87, P<0.05). F1 (60.53% variance explanation rate) loaded predominantly on N fertilization rates and chloroplast pigments, whereas F2 (23.75%) exhibited strong factor loading with nicotine content, total N, and neochlorogenic acid content. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing N fertilization by 30% above the conventional rate mitigates the adverse effects of field chilling stress, leading to significant improvements in yield and quality of mature tobacco.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

Specialized smoking cessation treatments targeting their needs can be effective but have not been widely disseminated. Telephone delivered interventions, including by quitlines, show promise. However, few SSMI contact quitlines and few are referred to them by health professionals. Mental health peer workers can potentially play an important role in supporting smoking cessation. This study will apply a pragmatic model using peer workers to engage SSMI with a customized quitline service, forming the ""Quitlink"" intervention. Methods: A multi-center prospective, cluster-randomized, open, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial. Over 3 years, 382 smokers will be recruited from mental health services in Victoria, Australia. Following completion of baseline assessment, a brief intervention will be delivered by a peer worker. Participants will then be randomly allocated either to no further intervention, or to be referred and contacted by the Victorian Quitline and offered a targeted 8-week cognitive behavioral intervention along with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Follow-up measures will be administered at 2-, 5-, and 8-months post-baseline. The primary outcome is 6 months continuous abstinence from end of treatment with biochemical verification. Secondary outcomes include 7-day point prevalence abstinence from smoking, increased quit attempts, and reductions in cigarettes per day, cravings and withdrawal, mental health symptoms, and other substance use, and improvements in quality of life. We will use a generalized linear mixed model (linear regression for continuous outcomes and logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes) to handle clustering and the repeated measures at baseline, 2-, 5-, and 8-months; individuals will be modeled as random effects, cluster as a random effect, and group assignment as a fixed effect. Discussion: This is the first rigorously designed RCT to evaluate a specialized quitline intervention accompanied by NRT among SSMI. The study will apply a pragmatic model to link SSMI to the Quitline, using peer workers, with the potential for wide dissemination. Clinical Trial Registration: Trial Registry: The trial is registered with ANZCTR (www.anzctr.org.au): ACTRN12619000244101 prior to the accrual of the first participant and updated regularly as per registry guidelines.

Problematically, much of the tobacco prevention literature and funding inundates tobacco users with smoking tobacco information while neglecting to provide them any information about smokeless tobacco. Meanwhile, American tobacco companies continually market new and dissolvable tobacco products targeted at non-smokers. New data suggests that smokeless tobacco use is, also, increasing in West Virginia and, in order to address this increased use, the West Virginia Extension Service recently partnered with the Division of Tobacco Prevention in the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources to develop a comprehensive spit tobacco curriculum for West Virginia students between third and sixth grade. This article details the development and assessment of the spit tobacco prevention curriculum and the resulting report from the initial pilot of the program. The curriculum was piloted across six counties with the participation of schools, after-school programs and 4-H clubs. After implementation, survey results demonstrate that youth have increased awareness of the health effects of smokeless tobacco.

Brief research.,"In recent years, the tobacco industry has been pushing a narrative that their newer lines of products-including electronic nicotine delivery devices-are offered in part to meet a social responsibility of providing potentially reduced-harm choices to their consumers. While some of the newer tobacco products might potentially be less harmful than combustible tobacco products, there is also significant deviation from the very concept of harm reduction when it is used for such a conspicuously commercialized purpose. The framing of commercialized tobacco harm reduction as a mere consumer preference by the industry is not clearly consistent with the core principles of harm reduction, let alone the human right to health and the highest attainable level of health. A human rights-based approach (HRBA) to harm reduction is a set of principles that frame an effort to respect and promote human rights, including the right to health. Whether the HRBA supports commercialized harm reduction requires study. We review industry materials from 2017 to 2022 to identify themes in the harm reduction narrative of the tobacco industry and analyse those themes using an HRBA to the tobacco harm reduction framework. Using this analysis, the industry's continued marketing of combustible products alongside their ""potentially less harmful"" products, and preference that their non-combustible products be regulated less strictly than cigarettes and cigars, adulterates the public health principles of harm reduction and undermines the right to health. We conclude that the tobacco industry's commercialized tobacco harm reduction is incompatible with a human rights-based approach to tobacco harm reduction.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

This research uses replicable criteria to identify vaping influencers who have worked with vaping brands to promote vaping products on Instagram and documents the extent to which posts by these users comply with existing advertising regulations. METHODOLOGY: We conducted three google searches collecting eight different vaping influencer lists, with a total of 575 unique influencers. We limited our sample to public accounts with 100,000 followers or more (n = 54). An initial sample of 360 Instagram posts was used to identify an analytic sample of 262 vape-related posts from 2021. We conducted a conceptual content analysis to first identify unambiguous vaping advertisements (branded content), and then code ads for compliance with existing regulations. RESULTS: On average, the 54 Instagram accounts had 265,851.9 followers (sd = 383,349.8) and 4,158 posts (sd = 7,302.1). Most posts featured vaping products 239 (91.2%), with 186 (76.2%) posts being unambiguously branded vape advertisements and 31 (14.3%) even including purchase links in the post itself. However, one post complied with FTC disclosure guidelines. Although 50 (20.9%) had warning labels, only 8 (15.1%) were fully compliant with FDA warning label guidelines.

Marketing is a known risk factor for e-cigarette initiation, yet little is known of e-cigarette marketing on social media in low- and middle-income countries. This study compares e-cigarette social media marketing in India, Indonesia, and Mexico, three such countries with different regulatory environments. METHODS: Instances of e-cigarette marketing on social media platforms were identified via the Tobacco Enforcement and Reporting Movement (TERM), a digital tobacco marketing monitoring system. Through systematic keyword-based searches, all tobacco marketing posts observed between 15 December 2021 and 16 March 2022 were included in the analysis. The final sample included 1,437 e-cigarette-related posts on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok, which were systematically content analyzed by independent coders after inter-reliability (Cohen's Kappa K > 0.79) was established using a theory-derived codebook. The final data is represented in percentages and frequencies for ease of presentation. RESULTS: We observed e-cigarette marketing online in all countries studied, yet there was variation in the volume of marketing and types of accounts identified. In India, where e-cigarettes were comprehensively banned, we identified 90 (6%) posts; in Mexico, where e-cigarettes were partially restricted, 318 (22%) posts were observed; and in Indonesia, where there were no restrictions, 1,029 (72%) posts were observed. In both India and Mexico, marketing originated from retailer accounts (100%), whereas in Indonesia, it was primarily product brand accounts (86%). Across countries, e-cigarettes were mostly marketed directly to sell products (India: 99%, Indonesia: 69% and Mexico: 93%), though the sales channels varied. Product features, including e-liquid flavors, device colors and technical specifications, was the most prominent message framing (India: 86%; Mexico: 73%; Indonesia: 58%). Harm reduction messaging was most popular in Mexico (8%) and was not common in Indonesia (0.3%) or India (0%). CONCLUSION: Our study provides important insights for tobacco control stakeholders on the evolving nature of e-cigarette marketing in low- and middle-income countries. It underscores the presence of e-cigarette marketing, including in countries where comprehensive regulations exist, and suggests the importance of continuous monitoring to keep up with industry practices and strengthen tobacco control stakeholder efforts to counter them.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) have a long history of leveraging narratives to serve commercial ambitions. The global reach of these companies' narratives has been highlighted as a challenge in combatting public health problems caused by tobacco. The corporate power of TTCs is carefully curated, and their narratives play an important role in the setting of governance dynamics at local, national and transnational levels. This qualitative work explores and compares the language used by British American Tobacco (BAT) and Philip Morris International (PMI) around harm, harm reduction and terms used to refer to newer nicotine and tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products. We systematically examine framings used by these two TTCs through company reports published between 2011 and 2021. Qualitative coding was carried out by four coders, according to a protocol developed specifically for this work. We firstly identified the presence of pre-selected keywords and then assigned chunks of text containing those key words to one or more associated frames drawn from Boydstun's policy frames codebook (2013). Qualitative coding identified the most common frames from Boydstun's codebook and thematic analysis highlighted three overarching themes. The most common frames assigned were ""capacity and resources"", ""health and safety"" and ""economic"" frames. The overarching themes were individualization, normalization, and regulation. These themes capture how both BAT and PMI use particular framings to downplay the role of TTCs in the perpetuation of population- and individual-level harms related to tobacco use. They seek to normalize their role in public discussions of health policy, to cast themselves as instrumental in the redress of tobacco-related inequalities and shift responsibility for the continuation of tobacco-product use onto individual consumers. These tactics are problematic for the effective and impartial development and implementation of local, national and international tobacco control agendas.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

However, the risk effects of ENDS on physical health, especially oral health, are still ambiguous. The purpose of this study was to review the available evidence on risks of ENDS on oral health, and compares the differences between ENDS and traditional cigarettes. For heavy smokers, transferring the addiction of tobacco to ENDS can be less harmful to periodontal condition and physical health but is not completely without risk. The components of ENDS vapor have cytotoxic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic properties, and its usage may be associated with a wide range of oral health sequelae. The chemicals in ENDS increase the susceptibility to tooth decay, increase the risk of periodontal disease, peri-implant, and oral mucosal lesions. Nicotine aerosols from ENDS can be a potential risk factor for oral cancer due to the presence of carcinogenic components. Compared to smoking traditional cigarettes, the harm associated with ENDS use may be underestimated due to the reduced ability to control vaping behavior, ease of ENDS access, fewer vaping area restrictions, and better taste. Currently, the available evidence suggests that ENDS may be a safer alternative to traditional tobacco products. Though most oral symptoms experienced by ENDS users are relatively mild and temporary compared to traditional cigarettes, the dangers of ENDS still exist. However, further research with longer follow-up periods is required to establish the long-term safety of ENDS.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Often perceived to be more pleasant and healthy, filters encouraged smoking. However, filtered cigarettes are more deeply inhaled to obtain the same nicotine demand while altered combustion releases more tobacco-specific nitrosamines. The increasing use of cigarette filter ventilation is associated with a sharp rise in lung adenocarcinomas in recent decades. While not preventing adverse health effects, a global environmental problem has been created due to the non-biodegradable filter litter, causing ecotoxicological effects and the spread of microplastics. Recently, the Belgian Superior Health Council advised policymakers to ban cigarette filters as single-use plastics at both national and European levels. This article outlines the arguments used to justify this plea (human health and environment), the expected effects of a filter ban, as well as the public reception and reactions of the tobacco industry. The specific context of the European Union is discussed including the revision of the Single-Use Plastics Directive, affording a new opportunity to ban plastic filters.

While existing evidence focuses on 13-15-year-olds, data from Sub-Saharan Africa indicates that smoking initiation ranges from as young as 7 years old to around 16 years old. The lack of data on adolescent tobacco use in African countries limits policymakers' ability to implement evidence-based tobacco control policies. This study aims to address the critical lack of quality and timely primary data on adolescent tobacco use, thereby enhancing the country's capacity to target interventions effectively, engage local governments, and attract global attention and funding for adolescent health initiatives. METHODS: We will conduct a cross-sectional nationwide survey among adolescents aged 10-17 years in urban and rural areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Kenya and Nigeria. This household-based survey will utilize a multi-stage stratified sample design to ensure representation across diverse geographic and demographic characteristics. The sample size calculations resulted in nationally representative samples of 6,701 adolescents in Kenya, 4,803 adolescents in the DRC, and 7,948 adolescents in Nigeria. DISCUSSION: Through this initiative, we aim to catalyze action at national and international levels to combat the tobacco epidemic among adolescents in Sub Saharan Africa. The findings from the study will empower stakeholders to advocate effective tobacco control measures, promote adolescent health, and safeguard future generations from the harmful effects of tobacco use.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

These tobacco-free oral products deliver nicotine through the gums. They are are viewed as potential alternatives to traditional tobacco and are marketed as safer alternatives. AIM: This review evaluates the health-related effects, explore consumer behavior, understand usage trends, and consider regulatory perspectives of nicotine pouches, focusing on their potential role in harm reduction. RESULTS: Nicotine pouches contain variable levels of nicotine (1-47 mg/pouch), with high pH values (median 8.8) that may increase nicotine bioavailability through the oral mucosa. Although they contain fewer harmful substances than traditional tobacco products, some types do contain harmful chemicals including formaldehyde, chromium, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines, which raise concerns about potential long-term health risks. Limited preliminary studies suggest reduced toxicant exposure compared to combustible tobacco, but the long-term health effects are still unknown. Consumer awareness significantly varies (7-47%) across populations, with higher usage noted among males, younger adults, and former tobacco users. On a global level, regulatory approaches differ, from total bans in some countries to minimum age requirements in others. CONCLUSION: Nicotine pouches are quickly becoming a popular alternative to traditional tobacco, providing potential harm reduction by containing fewer harmful constituents. However, they still contain the addictive substance nicotine and, in some cases, trace amounts of substances such as formaldehyde, which have been detected at very low levels, often near or below detection limits, and may not be considered a significant health risk according to some studies. Although they may aid existing smokers in harm reduction, there are still concerns about youth initiation, dual-use, marketing practices, and long-term oral and cardiovascular health effects. Inconsistent regulations, variable product quality, and a lack of longitudinal studies indicates a need for comprehensive research to guide evidence-based policies. Policymakers should prioritize standardized testing and marketing controls to safeguard public health, adopting a precautionary approach until long-term safety is established.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

Despite progress in some countries through implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), significant gaps remain due to weak regulatory frameworks, limited enforcement capacity, and persistent interference from the tobacco industry. Against this backdrop, tobacco harm reduction (THR), the substitution of combustible products with non-combustible or lower-exposure alternatives such as nicotine replacement therapies, electronic cigarettes, and heated tobacco products, offers a potentially valuable but underutilized strategy. Rather than a systematic review, this work offers a narrative, opinion-based synthesis of policy and evidence sources published between 2015 and 2024. While the WHO currently does not endorse electronic cigarettes or heated-tobacco products as cessation tools, the guiding principles of the WHO FCTC: proportional risk assessment, transparency, and surveillance, provide a conceptual basis for evaluating all nicotine-delivery systems under strict regulation. Latin-American governments should prioritize access to approved nicotine-replacement therapies and cessation services, while considering time-bounded, independent evaluation of non-combustible products within WHO FCTC guardrails where these are already present in the market. This perspective aims to inform balanced, evidence-based debate rather than advocate adoption of any specific product or policy.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Methods: Data are from eight cross-sectional online surveys among national samples of 16- to 19-year-olds in Canada, England, and the US conducted from 2017 to 2022 (N = 104,467). Average wave percentage change in EC and TC purchasing prevalence and purchase locations were estimated using Joinpoint regressions. Results: EC purchasing increased between 2017 and 2022, although the pattern of change differed by country. EC purchasing plateaued in 2019 for the US and in 2020 for Canada, while increasing through 2022 for England. TC purchasing declined sharply in the US, with purchasing from traditional retail locations declining, while purchasing from social sources increased. Vape shops were the most common location for EC purchasing, although declining in England and the US. Conclusion: Trends in EC and TC purchasing trends in the US are consistent with the expected impact of the federal MLA law increasing the legal age to 21 years in December 2019.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

METHODS: This qualitative case study of a non-gaming Twitch stream included data from influencer conversations, viewer comments and visual elements. Thematic analysis, coding, and categorisation were conducted using ATLAS.ti. RESULTS: The livestream, which attracted over ten thousand viewers, featured three friends vaping and discussing their personal experiences with Juul. Themes included curiosity, device sharing, and smoking cessation benefits. The stream fostered a casual, engaging atmosphere, with viewers interacting extensively with the influencers and also other viewers. Despite suspicions of industry sponsorship, viewers reacted positively and even joked about the sponsorship. Several viewers, including those who claimed not to smoke, expressed interest in Juul. CONCLUSION: The study highlights concerns about the promotion of harmful commodities on Twitch, where strong community engagement, monetary incentives, and a lack of specific content policies create a conducive environment for such practices. This underscores the need for greater scrutiny and regulation of e-cigarette promotions on the platform.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

The extract of L. platyphylla reduces the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein, which is increased by nicotine, back to normal levels, and increases the expression of dopamine transporter (DAT) protein, which is reduced by nicotine, back to normal levels in PC12 cells. In this study, rats received nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, subcutaneously) only for seven days and then received extract of L. platyphylla (200 or 400 mg/kg, oral) 1 h prior to nicotine administration for an additional seven days. The extract of L. platyphylla reduced locomotor activity compared to the nicotine control group in rats. The extract of L. platyphylla significantly attenuated the repeated nicotine-induced DAT protein expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but there was no effect on increased TH protein expression in the dorsal striatum. These findings suggest that L. platyphylla extract has a mitigating effect on nicotine-induced behavioral sensitization by modulating DAT protein expression in the NAc. For quality control of L. plathyphylla, spicatoside A and D, which are saponin compounds, were quantified in the L. platyphylla extract. The amounts of spicatoside A and D in L. platyphylla extract obtained from ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry were 0.148 and 0.272 mg/g, respectively.

Like cigarette smoke, e-cig vapor contains harmful and potentially harmful compounds, although in fewer numbers and at substantially lower concentrations. Many of the same constituents of e-cig vapor and cigarette smoke induce epigenetic changes that can lead to the dysregulation of disease-related genes. MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression in health and disease states. Extensive research has shown that miRNAs play a prominent role in the regulation of genes involved in the pathogenesis of smoking-related diseases. However, the use of miRNAs for investigating the disease-causing potential of vaping has not been fully explored. This review article provides an overview of e-cigs as a highly consequential electronic nicotine delivery system, describes trends in e-cig use among adolescents and adults, and discusses the ongoing debate on the public health impact of vaping. Highlighting the significance of miRNAs in cell biology and disease, it summarizes the published and ongoing research on miRNAs in relation to gene regulation and disease pathogenesis in e-cig users and in vitro experimental settings. It identifies gaps in knowledge and priorities for future research while underscoring the need for empirical evidence that can inform the regulation of tobacco products to protect youth and promote public health.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Participants were encouraged to use these products in the anticipation of reducing the number of cig/day smoked. SETTINGS: Staff from LIAF contacted 10 vape shops in the province of the city of Catania (Italy) that acted as sponsors to the 2013 No Tobacco Day. PARTICIPANTS: 71 adult smokers (≥18 years old) making their first purchase at local participating vape shops were asked by professional retail staff to complete a form. MEASUREMENTS: Their cigarette consumption was followed-up prospectively at 6 and 12 months.

Such claims are popular among opponents of tobacco harm reduction, claiming that low-risk tobacco products (e.g., e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco) cause people to start smoking, sometimes backed by empirical studies that ostensibly support the claim. However, these studies consistently ignore the obvious alternative causal pathways, particularly that observed associations might represent causation in the opposite direction (smoking causes people to seek low-risk alternatives) or confounding (the same individual characteristics increase the chance of using any tobacco product). Due to these complications, any useful analysis must deal with simultaneity and confounding by common cause. In practice, existing analyses seem almost as if they were designed to provide teaching examples about drawing simplistic and unsupported causal conclusions from observed associations. The present analysis examines what evidence and research strategies would be needed to empirically detect such a gateway effect, if there were one, explaining key methodological concepts including causation and confounding, examining the logic of the claim, identifying potentially useful data, and debunking common fallacies on both sides of the argument, as well as presenting an extended example of proper empirical testing. The analysis demonstrates that none of the empirical studies to date that are purported to show a gateway effect from tobacco harm reduction products actually does so. The observations and approaches can be generalized to other cases where observed association of individual characteristics in cross-sectional data could result from any of several causal relationships.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The aim of the study was to assess how adolescents rate relative harmfulness of slim and menthol cigarettes, water pipes, e-cigarettes, and smokeless tobacco compared to regular cigarettes. Cross-sectional survey data from students aged 13-19 years from Piotrkowski district, Poland were analyzed. Among the sample of 4050 students, 3552 respondents completed anonymous, confidential, self-administered questionnaire adapted from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS). The study results indicate that the students perceived slim cigarettes and menthol cigarettes as less harmful, which is in line with the message created by tobacco companies. On the other hand, less popular products such as water pipes and smokeless tobacco were considered as more harmful. The current study indicates insufficient and misleading perception of harmfulness of different tobacco/nicotine products available on the Polish market. Simultaneously, there is insufficient countrywide public health education in this matter. Preventive measures are necessary to discourage young people from smoking uptake and to ensure that potential consumers can, based on objective data, make informed decisions about cigarettes and non-cigarette tobacco products.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

This research was conducted in spring and summer 2016 and identified 28 vape shops online. We confirmed 16 vape shops (seven in Pitt County, NC, USA, and nine in Durham County, NC, USA). Online searches ranged in sensitivity, 62.5%-81.3%, and PPVs ranged from 73.3% to 92.3%. Because of the range of sensitivity found among the business listing services, state policymakers should consider uniform licensing requirements for vape and tobacco retailers to more easily track retailers and ensure compliance with regulations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Interviewees were registrants of a 2016 National Cancer Institute grantee meeting on tobacco warnings. Several participants agreed that the Food and Drug Administration's new nicotine addiction warning for e-cigarettes could be informative but that it might not resonate with young people. Many agreed that more than one warning would be important as e-cigarette science evolves and that research on additional warning themes (e.g., nicotine exposure, harmful constituents) and execution styles (including use of pictorials) was important. Participants were somewhat mixed about the use of reduced-risk messages within e-cigarette warnings, but agreed that research on how to communicate about cigarette/e-cigarette relative risks was needed. Overall, more research is needed on tobacco warnings for non-cigarette products, including on the message content, placement, execution and potential impact on audiences' product knowledge, risk perceptions and use intentions. This is particularly needed for products such as e-cigarettes which may have harm-reduction potential relative to cigarettes and require unique considerations.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

While most studies consider a subset of these characteristics with weak measures of regular e-cigarette use, this study uses a large, recent U.S. survey to simultaneously consider the association of each of these factors with different use measures. Data from the May 2014 Tobacco Use Supplement-Current Population Survey is supplemented with information on tobacco control policies. The prevalence of ever, current (at least 1 of the last 30 days), and regular (at least 20 of the last 30 days) e-cigarette use were 7.7%, 2.1% and 0.9%, implying that 27.0% of ever users were current users of which 45.3% were regular users. E-cigarette use varied by socio-demographic characteristics and by smoking status, and depended on the measure of use adopted. However, regardless of measures, e-cigarette use was higher among those smokers who smoked more cigarettes. The association with policies was generally weak, but we found more regular use by smokers in low tax and low tobacco control spending states. The results indicate that the user characteristics differ depending on the e-cigarette use measure. The measure of use should be carefully considered in analyzing how e-cigarette use affects cigarette use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The total sample size was 567 participants. Only 22% knew that GRAS designation meant that a product is safe to ingest, not inhale, inject, or use topically. Of participants who considered flavorings to be GRAS, the majority recognized that the designation meant a product is safe to ingest but also considered it safe to inhale. Although scientific uncertainty on the overall safety of flavorings in e-cigarettes remains, health messaging can educate the public about the GRAS designation and its irrelevance to e-cigarette safety.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In 2016, data were collected from 2720 French-speaking students participating in a web-based study on students' health: the internet-based Students Health Research Enterprise (i-Share) project. Univariate analyses and multivariable logistic regressions were performed to study the relationship between e-cigarette use and smoking status. Two out of five students declared having tried e-cigarettes and 3.6% were current users. Former smokers were more likely than current smokers to use e-cigarettes currently. Among those who had never smoked, 13.5% had tried e-cigarettes. Very few (0.3%) were current users, alternating e-liquids with and without nicotine. The three main reasons for trying e-cigarettes were curiosity, offer to try by someone, and attractiveness of e-liquid flavors. Among current smokers, previous attempts to quit smoking and a strong desire to stop tobacco were reported more in e-cigarette current users than in former users. In this large sample of French students, findings were consistent with the possibility that e-cigarettes might be used as smoking cessation or reduction aids by some young adults whereas other young never-smokers could be exposed to nicotine.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

An Australian National Cross-Sectional Survey.","Clinicians often ask pregnant women about tobacco smoking, but their practices of asking about other smoking and nicotine exposures are unknown. This study analysed how often clinicians ask pregnant women about their use of e-cigarettes, cannabis, chewing tobacco, and second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure. Two cross-sectional surveys were undertaken. A random sample of 500 General Practitioner (GP) members were invited from the National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (NFATSIH) to complete an on-line survey, and 5571 GP and Obstetrician (OBS) members of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) were sent a paper survey by mail. Questions on frequency of asking about the exposures used Likert Scales, later dichotomized to ""often-always"" and ""never-sometimes"". Logistic regressions estimated associations between clinician type and asking about cannabis, e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and SHS. An adjusted model reduced potential confounders of location, guidelines, gender and population. n = 378 GPs and OBS participated (6.2% response). In total, 13-14% asked ""often-always"" about e-cigarettes; 58% cannabis; 38% cannabis with tobacco; 27% SHS, and 10% chewing tobacco-compared to 95% of the sample asking about cigarette smoking. After adjustment, the odds of RANZCOG GPs (OR 0.34) and OBS (OR 0.63) asking about cannabis were lower compared to NFATSIH GPs. Clinician type was non-significant for asking about e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco and SHS. Surveyed Australian GPs and obstetricians asked less frequently about e-cigarettes, chewing, SHS exposure, and cannabis, potentially missing important exposures for mother and child.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This paper reports the results of an electronic survey of vapers in New Zealand, a country where the sale and supply of e-liquids containing nicotine is illegal, although vapers can legally access e-liquids from overseas. An on-line survey was conducted, using vaper and smoking cessation networks for recruitment, with follow up surveys conducted 1 and 2 months after the initial survey. 218 participants were recruited. Almost all had been smokers, but three quarters no longer smoked, with the remainder having significantly reduced their tobacco use. Three participants were non-smokers before starting to vape, but none had gone on to become smokers. The overriding motivation to begin and continue vaping was to stop or to reduce smoking. The results were consistent with a progression from initially both vaping and smoking using less effective electronic cigarette types, then moving to more powerful devices, experimentation with flavors and nicotine strengths-all resulting in reducing or stopping tobacco use. Lack of access to nicotine and lack of support for their chosen cessation method were the main problems reported. Vaping had resulted in effective smoking cessation for the majority of participants.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Three popular e-liquid flavors (cinnamon, mango, vanilla) were analyzed using qualitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in the un-puffed state. Each liquid was also machine-puffed under realistic-use flow rate conditions and emissions were captured using two techniques: filter pads and methanol impingers. GC-MS analysis was conducted on the emissions captured using both techniques from all three e-liquids. The e-liquid GC-MS analysis resulted in positive identification of 13 compounds from the cinnamon flavor e-liquid, 31 from mango, and 19 from vanilla, including a number of compounds observed in all e-liquid experiments. Nineteen compounds were observed in emissions which were not present in the un-puffed e-liquid. Qualitative GC-MS analysis of the emissions samples identify compounds observed in all three samples: e-liquid, impinge, and filter pads, and each subset thereof. A limited number of compounds were observed in emissions captured with impingers, but were not observed in emissions captured using filter pads; a larger number of compounds were observed on emissions collected from the filter pads, but not those captured with impingers. It is demonstrated that sampling methods have different sampling efficiencies and some compounds might be missed using only one method. It is recommended to investigate filter pads, impingers, thermal desorption tubes, and solvent extraction resins to establish robust sampling methods for emissions testing of e-cigarette emissions.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: We collected data from 956 daily smokers in 2014-2015 regarding ever EC use and smoking behaviors at baseline, any and past 30-day EC use at the 3-month follow-up. Outcomes measured at 6 months included past 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA), biochemically validated quitting, smoking reduction (≥50% from baseline) and cessation attempt. Logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for quitting in relation to EC use, adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and smoking profile. Complete case, missing observation as smoking and propensity score analyses were conducted. RESULTS: By complete case, ever EC use at baseline did not predict self-reported PPA (AOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.57-1.73), biochemically validated quitting (AOR 1.22, 95% CI 0.64-2.34), cessation attempt (AOR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48-1.14), or smoking reduction (AOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54-1.47). EC use during the first 3 months did not predict quitting (AOR 1.02, 95% CI 0.22-4.71). Similar results were observed for missing observations as smoking and propensity score analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Any use of ECs, many of which lack nicotine, did not predict smoking abstinence among Hong Kong adult smokers.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Little is known to inform public health efforts to reduce youth use. We examined psychosocial correlates of single and multiple tobacco product use among youth e-cigarette users. Data were from the 2014 Florida Youth Tobacco Survey (N = 69,923), a representative sample of Florida middle and high school students. Associations between combinations of e-cigarette, cigarette and other tobacco product (OTP) use and psychosocial variables were examined using multinomial logistic regression with an analytic sample of N = 2756. Most e-cigarette-using youth used at least one other product (81%). Perceiving cigarettes as easy to quit was significantly associated with greater likelihood of combined e-cigarette/OTP use (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 2.51, p < 0.001) and combined e-cigarette/cigarette/OTP use (RRR = 3.20, p < 0.0001). Thinking you will be smoking cigarettes in 5 years was associated with product combinations that include cigarettes. Tobacco company marketing receptivity was associated with multiple product user types. Given that specific psychosocial factors put youth at risk for concurrent use of e-cigarettes with tobacco products, public health efforts should address polytobacco use specifically, instead of individual product use. Youth perceptions about the ease of quitting cigarettes, intentions to continue smoking cigarettes and receptivity to tobacco company marketing are promising areas for messaging aimed at reducing e-cigarette polytobacco product use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

We developed a new protocol for evaluating e-cigarette warnings by placing them on users' own devices to reflect real-world exposure. Study 1 participants were a national convenience sample of 606 U.S. adult e-cigarette users surveyed online in March 2017. Most Study 1 participants were willing to have their e-cigarette devices (87%) and refills (83%) labeled. Study 2 participants were a convenience sample of 22 adult e-cigarette users recruited in California, United States in April 2017. We applied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's proposed e-cigarette warning to users' own devices and refills. Most Study 2 participants (81%) reported using e-cigarette devices with our warning labels at least 90% of the time during the study. Nearly all (95%) said they would participate in the study again, and 100% would recommend the study to a friend. Conversations about e-cigarette harms, conversations about quitting e-cigarettes, and intentions to quit using e-cigarettes increased during the study (all p < 0.05). These studies show that our naturalistic labeling protocol was feasible, acceptable to participants, and had high retention over three weeks. Using the protocol can yield important evidence on the impact of e-cigarette warnings to inform tobacco warning policies.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

We describe overall change in prevalence of tobacco product use and within-person transitions in tobacco product use in the U.S. between 2013⁻2014 and 2014⁻2015 for young adults (18⁻24 years) and older adults (25+ years). Data from Wave 1 (W1, 2013⁻2014) and Wave 2 (W2, 2014⁻2015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study were analyzed (N = 34,235). Tobacco product types were categorized into: (1) combustible (cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah), (2) noncombustible (smokeless tobacco, snus pouches, dissolvable tobacco), and (3) electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Transitions for individual combustible-product types, and for single- and multiple-product use, were also considered. Overall prevalence of current tobacco use decreased from 27.6% to 26.3%. Among W1 non-tobacco users, 88.7% of young adults and 95.8% of older adults were non-tobacco users at W2. Among W1 tobacco users, 71.7% of young adults transitioned, with 20.7% discontinuing use completely, and 45.9% of older adults transitioned, with 12.5% discontinuing use completely. Continuing with/transitioning toward combustible product(s), particularly cigarettes, was more common than continuing with/transitioning toward ENDS. Tobacco use behaviors were less stable among young adults than older adults, likely reflecting greater product experimentation among young adults. Relative stability of cigarette use compared to other tobacco products (except older adult noncombustible use) demonstrates high abuse liability for cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We examine how characteristics of adult tobacco users in the U.S. relate to transitions in tobacco product use. Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study data were analyzed from 12,862 adult current tobacco users who participated in Wave 1 (W1, 2013⁻2014) and Wave 2 (W2, 2014⁻2015). Three types of transitions were examined-(1) adding tobacco product(s); (2) switching to non-cigarette tobacco product(s); and (3) discontinuing all tobacco use-among those currently using: (1) any tobacco product; (2) cigarettes only (i.e., exclusive cigarette); and (3) cigarettes plus another tobacco product(s) (i.e., poly-cigarette). Multinomial logistic regression analyses determined relative risk of type of transition versus no transition as a function of demographic and tobacco use characteristics. Transitions in tobacco product use among adult tobacco users were common overall, but varied among different demographic groups, including by age, sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and poverty level. Further, cigarette smokers with higher dependence scores were more likely to add product(s) and less likely to discontinue tobacco use compared to those with low dependence scores. That high nicotine dependence is a barrier to discontinuing tobacco use adds evidence to support policy to lower nicotine content of cigarettes and to evaluate new products for their potential to reduce cigarette use.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Findings from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) 4 Country Smoking and Vaping Survey.,"Aim: This study examines where vapers purchase their vaping refills in countries having different regulations over such devices, Canada (CA), the United States (US), England (EN), and Australia (AU). Methods: Data were available from 1899 current adult daily and weekly vapers who participated in the 2016 (Wave 1) International Tobacco Control Four Country Smoking and Vaping. The outcome was purchase location of vaping supplies (online, vape shop, other). Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported for between country comparisons. Results: Overall, 41.4% of current vapers bought their vaping products from vape shops, 27.5% bought them online, and 31.1% from other retail locations. The vast majority of vapers (91.1%) reported using nicotine-containing e-liquids. In AU, vapers were more likely to buy online vs other locations compared to CA (OR = 6.4, 2.3⁻17.9), the US (OR = 4.1, 1.54⁻10.7), and EN (OR = 7.9, 2.9⁻21.8). In the US, they were more likely to buy from vape shops (OR = 3.3, 1.8⁻6.2) or online (OR = 1.9, 1.0⁻3.8) vs other retail locations when compared to those in EN. In CA, vapers were more likely to purchase at vape shops than at other retail locations when compared to vapers in EN (5.9, 3.2⁻10.9) and the US (1.87, 1.0⁻3.1). Conclusions: The regulatory environment and enforcement of such regulations appear to influence the location where vapers buy their vaping products. In AU, banning the retail sale of nicotine vaping products has led vapers to rely mainly on online purchasing sources, whereas the lack of enforcement of the same regulation in CA has allowed specialty vape shops to flourish.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

While UK guidelines recommend nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation during pregnancy, adherence to NRT is generally low and may partially explain why NRT appears less effective in pregnancy compared to non-pregnant smokers. This study aimed to identify and describe factors associated with NRT adherence from a health professional's perspective. Two focus groups and one expert group were conducted with 26 professionals involved in antenatal stop smoking services and the data were analysed thematically using a template methodology. From our analyses, we extracted two main themes: (i) 'Barriers to NRT use in pregnancy' explores the issues of how misinformation and unrealistic expectations could discourage NRT use, while (ii) 'Facilitators to NRT use in pregnancy' describes the different information, and modes of delivery, that stop smoking professionals believe will encourage correct and sustained NRT use. Understanding the barriers and facilitators to improve NRT adherence may aid the development of educational interventions to encourage NRT use and improve outcomes for pregnant women wanting to stop smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The prevalence of past 30-day vaping nicotine, non-nicotine and cannabis substances, as well as cannabis modes of use was examined. Logistic regression models examined between country differences in prevalence. Results: Past 30-day cannabis use was highest among Canadian youth (16.6%), followed by youth in the U.S. (13.8%) and England (9.0%).

Two themes were extracted that describe health professionals' attitudes towards using NRT either during lapses or to reduce smoking in women who cannot quit (harm reduction). These are presented around a social-ecological framework describing three hierarchical levels of influence within smoking cessation support: (1) Organizational: providing NRT during lapses could be expensive for SSS though harm reduction could result in services helping a wider range of clients. (2) Interpersonal: participants felt using NRT for harm reduction was not compatible with cessation-orientated messages practitioners conveyed to clients. (3) Individual: practitioners' advice regarding using NRT during smoking lapses varied; many were generally uncomfortable about concurrent smoking and NRT use and had strong reservations about recommending NRT when smoking during all but the briefest lapses.

This study aims to compare characteristics and tobacco-related behaviors among concurrent users of HTPs and combustible cigarettes (n = 644) with exclusive smokers (n = 3194) or exclusive HTP users (n = 164). The secondary aim was to explore heterogeneity within concurrent use subgroups. Data were from Wave 1 of the ITC Japan Survey, a nationally representative web survey conducted from February to March 2018. Concurrent cigarette-HTP users were younger and wealthier than exclusive smokers. However, there were no difference in the frequency of smoking, number of cigarettes per day, and smoking cessation behaviors between the two groups, suggesting that HTPs reinforce nicotine dependence. Compared to exclusive HTP users, concurrent cigarette-HTP users reported higher frequency of non-daily HTP use, and lower number of tobacco-containing inserts per day. Almost all concurrent cigarette-HTP users smoked every day (93.9%); 48.4% both smoked and used HTPs daily (dual daily users, n = 396), while 45.5% were daily smokers and non-daily HTP users (predominant smokers, n = 213). Concurrent user subgroups differed from each other on age, tobacco use behaviors, and quit intention. Alongside heterogeneity between concurrent and exclusive product users, differences across concurrent use subgroups highlight the importance of considering frequency of use in characterizing poly-tobacco users.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

The Head and Neck Oncology Clinic was engaged first in January 2019 as a pilot site given staff receptivity, elevated smoking prevalence, and a high tobacco screening rate (95%) yet low levels of tobacco cessation treatment referrals (<10%) and patient engagement (<1% of smokers treated). To improve referrals and engagement, system changes included an automated ""opt-out"" referral process and provision of tobacco cessation treatment as a covered benefit with flexible delivery options that included phone and telemedicine. Screening rates increased to 99%, referrals to 100%, 74% of patients were reached by counselors, and 33% of those reached engaged in treatment. Patient-reported abstinence from all tobacco products at 6-month follow-up is 20%. In July 2019, two additional oncology clinics were added. In December 2019, less than one year from initiating the QI pilot, with demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy, the tobacco treatment services were integrated into 14 clinics at Stanford Cancer Center.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

PM emissions of three cigarette brands (Marlboro Gold, Winston Red resp. Classic, Parliament Platinum resp. Night Blue) from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Germany were analysed. Second-hand smoke was produced in a 2.88 m3 measuring cabin by an automatic environmental tobacco smoke emitter. PM size fractions PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 were detected in real-time using laser aerosol spectrometry. Depending on the PM fraction Marlboro cigarettes from UAE showed 33%-35% higher PM amounts. Moreover, Winston cigarettes from UAE showed distinctly higher PM values (28-31%) than the German counterparts. The ""lighter"" Parliament from UAE emitted 3%-9% more PM than the German one. The measured mean PM10 values laid between 778 and 1163 µg/m3 (mean PM2.5: 777-1161 µg/m3; mean PM1: 724-1074 µg/m3). That means smoking in enclosed rooms causes massive PM burden. The PM emission of equal or similar tobacco products from different countries can differ distinctly. Hence, the declaration of PM emission values, besides nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide amounts, should be obligatory worldwide. Furthermore, complete information about the ingredients and production processes of tobacco products should be provided to health officials and the public. This can help to minimise or ban substances or product designs that make smoking even more harmful, and to enhance the awareness of the risks of smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Our study sought to establish the reliability and validity of a measure of prototypes of smokers and e-cigarette users. Participants were from a national survey of smokers and non-smokers (n = 1414), a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of adult smokers (n = 2149), and adolescent children of adults in the trial (n = 112). The Prototypes of Tobacco Users Scale (POTUS) has four positive adjectives (cool, sexy, smart, and healthy) and four negative adjectives (disgusting, unattractive, immature, and inconsiderate) describing cigarette smokers and e-cigarette users. Confirmatory factor analyses identified a two-factor solution. The POTUS demonstrated strong internal consistency reliability in all three samples (median α = 0.85) and good test-retest reliability among adults in the RCT (median r = 0.61, 1-4 weeks follow-up). In the RCT, smokers more often agreed with negative prototypes for smokers than for e-cigarette users (mean = 2.03 vs. 1.67, p < 0.05); negative prototypes at baseline were also associated with more forgoing of cigarettes and making a quit attempt at the end of the trial (Week 4 follow-up). The POTUS may be useful to public health researchers seeking to design interventions that reduce tobacco initiation or cessation through the manipulation of tobacco user prototypes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

However, in-depth information about their use is often limited. Our study investigated patterns of use of e-cigarettes and attitudes and beliefs among smokers and ex-smokers in New Zealand (NZ), a country with an 'endgame' goal for smoked tobacco. Data came from smokers and ex-smokers in Waves 1 and 2 of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) NZ Survey (Wave 1 August 2016-April 2017, 1155 participants; Wave 2, June-December 2018, 1020 participants). Trial, current and daily use of e-cigarettes was common: daily use was 7.9% among smokers and 22.6% among ex-smokers in Wave 2, and increased between surveys. Use was commonest among 18-24 years and ex-smokers, but was similar among Māori and non-Māori participants, and by socio-economic status. Most participants used e-cigarettes to help them quit or reduce their smoking. The most common motivating factor for use was cost and the most common barrier to use cited was that e-cigarettes were less satisfying than smoking. The findings could inform developing interventions in order to maximise the contribution of e-cigarettes to achieving an equitable smoke-free Aotearoa, and to minimise any potential adverse impacts.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

However, few qualitative studies have explored consumer perceptions and understanding of comparative risk messages and wordings. We examined consumer perceptions of statements indicating reduced risks and exposure to chemicals from snus and e-cigarettes relative to smoking. We conducted 12 focus groups with adult smokers (ages 21-66) and young adult (YA) non-smokers (ages 18-25) (n = 57) in the USA in 2019. Participants shared reactions to modified risk and exposure messages and message variations. Participants largely understood claims, including language about ""switching completely."" However, participants expressed desire for more message specificity, evidence, risk reduction reasons, and statistics/quantitative information. Claim believability and acceptance was also limited by existing negative product beliefs and experiences, negative media reports, and skepticism about message source. YAs did not express product interest based on message exposure. Some YAs suggested the included ""smoker"" language made the messages less interesting/relevant. Given existing proposals for and use of MRTP messages, additional research on their wording, framing, delivery, and effects may help inform regulatory or organizational decisions about such messages, optimize potential benefits, and mitigate unintended consequences.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Data are from Waves 1 (W1: 2016) and 2 (W2: 2018) of the ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey, a cohort study of adult (≥18+) smokers, concurrent users (smoke and vape), and recent ex-smokers from Australia, Canada, England, and the United States (US). Respondents (N = 5016) were classified according to their smoking and vaping status, which resulted in eight subgroups: (1) exclusive daily smokers (2) exclusive non-daily smokers; (3-6) concurrent users (subdivided into four groups by each combination of daily/non-daily smoking and daily/non-daily vaping); (7) ex-smokers who vape; (8) ex-smokers not vaping. The analyses focused first on describing changes between groups from W1 to W2. Second, transition outcomes were assessed based on changes in smoking and vaping between W1 and W2. Transitions focused on smoking were: no change in smoking (continued smoking at the same frequency); decreased smoking; increased smoking; discontinued smoking; relapsed (ex-smokers at W1 who were smoking at W2). Transitions focused on vaping were: initiated vaping; switched from smoking to vaping. Overall, this study found that the vast majority of smokers were smoking 18 months later. Non-daily smokers were more likely than daily smokers to have discontinued smoking (p < 0.0001) and to have switched to exclusive vaping (p = 0.034). Exclusive non-daily smokers were more likely than exclusive daily smokers to have initiated vaping (p = 0.04). Among all W1 daily smokers, there were no differences in discontinued smoking between daily smokers who vaped (concurrent users) and exclusive daily smokers; however, concurrent users were more likely than exclusive daily smokers to have decreased to non-daily smoking (p < 0.001) or to have switched to vaping by W2 (p < 0.001). Among all W1 non-daily smokers, there were no significant differences in increased smoking or discontinued smoking between concurrent users or exclusive smokers. Most ex-smokers remained abstinent from smoking, and there was no difference in relapse back to smoking between those who vaped and those who did not.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We used a novel qualitative method in which 33 young adult tobacco users in California (fall 2019) ""unboxed"" an IQOS device, tobacco sticks, and marketing materials and narrated their impressions and opinions. We conducted content and thematic analyses of participants' reactions, sensory experiences, and interest. Multiple attributes influenced appeal for participants, including sleek electronic design, novel technology, perceived harmfulness, complexity, and high cost. The ""no smoke"" claim and heating technology suggested that smoking IQOS was safer than smoking cigarettes. Public health programs should closely monitor HTP marketing and uptake, particularly as ""reduced exposure"" claims were authorized in July 2020.

The present study evaluates the relationship between poly-use of tobacco products and intention to quit cigarette smoking in association with smoking intensity, a meaningful indication of one's interest in quitting cigarette smoking. A total of 36,397 current cigarette smokers who participated in the 2019 Korea Community Health Survey were evaluated. A multivariable logistic regression model was designed. Additionally, smoking-intensity-stratified analyses were conducted. A total of 4.7% of the participants reported planning to quit cigarette smoking within one month. Current dual users of combustible cigarettes and HTPs presented no significantly increased likelihood of intention to quit cigarette smoking regardless of cigarette-smoking intensity. By contrast, light and heavy daily smokers who accompanied e-cigarette use presented significant adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of 1.81 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-3.14) and 1.97 (95% CI: 1.14-3.42), respectively. Occasional and daily smokers who reported using both HTPs and e-cigarettes presented no significance.

Data were collected, using an observation checklist, between March and October 2014 (n = 1450 POS) and between March and October 2019 (n = 1320 POS). Ban on tobacco and e-cigarette advertising at POS is commonly violated in Poland. In all POS, at least one form (including tobacco products display) of tobacco advertising was found in 2014 and in 2019. The most common types of tobacco advertising in 2014 were change and counter mats (61%, 42%), posters (38%) and illuminated banners (37%). In 2019, a decrease in promoting tobacco products in the form of mats (p ≤ 0.001), posters and boards (p < 0.001) but an increase in video screens were observed (from 8% in 2014 to 30% in 2019; p < 0.001).

The minimum age or a no-sale-to-minors signs for tobacco and e-cigarettes were not sufficiently placed in POS to comply with the Act. Poor enforcement of the ban on tobacco and e-cigarette ads at POS provides the tobacco industry with an opportunity to promote their products using unlawful ways.

Nevertheless, high levels of dual use (i.e., using both combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes) occur among adults. Using formative data from in-depth interviews and employing learner verification, we adapted an existing, validated self-help smoking-cessation intervention (Stop Smoking for Good; SSFG) to create a targeted intervention for dual users, If You Vape: A Guide to Quitting Smoking (IYV). In Phase I, in-depth interviews (n = 28) were conducted to assess relevance of the existing SSFG materials (10 booklets, nine pamphlets) and identify new content for the booklets. Next, for Phase II, learner verification interviews (n = 20 dual users) were conducted to assess their appeal and acceptability. Several key themes emerged from the Phase I in-depth interviews. Findings led to the inclusion of e-cigarette-specific strategies used by successful quitters such as gradually reducing nicotine levels, switching from tobacco flavor to alternative flavors, and limiting e-cigarette use to places one would normally smoke (i.e., not expanding use). Suggestions from Phase II learner verification included broadening the visual appeal for a younger, more diverse demographic, expanding tips for quitting smoking via e-cigarettes, and expanding terminology for e-cigarette devices.

The Juul® e-cigarette was introduced in the U.S. market in 2015 and had captured approximately 13% of the U.S. market by 2017. Unlike many other contemporary electronic cigarette companies, the founders behind the Juul® e-cigarette approached their product launch like a traditional high-tech start-up company, not like a tobacco company. This article presents a case study of Juul's corporate and product development history in the context of US regulatory actions. The objective of this article is to demonstrate the value of government-curated archives as leading indicators which can (a) provide insight into emergent technologies and (b) inform emergent regulatory science research questions. A variety of sources were used to gather data about the Juul® e-cigarette and the corporations that surround it. Sources included government agencies, published academic literature, non-profit organizations, corporate and retail websites, and the popular press. Data were disambiguated, authenticated, and categorized prior to being placed on a timeline of events. A timeline of four significant milestones, nineteen corporate filings and events, twelve US regulatory actions, sixty-four patent applications, eighty-seven trademark applications, twenty-three design patents and thirty-two utility patents related to Juul Labs and its associates is presented, spanning the years 2004 through 2020. This work demonstrates the probative value of findings from patent, trademark, and SEC filing literature in establishing a premise for emergent regulatory science research questions which may not yet be supported by traditional archival research literature. The methods presented here can be used to identify key aspects of emerging technologies before products actually enter the market; this shifting policy formulation and problem identification from a paradigm of being reactive in favor of becoming proactive. Such a proactive approach may permit anticipatory regulatory science research and ultimately shorten the elapsed time between market technology innovation and regulatory response.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

We used U.S. nationally representative data to prospectively evaluate the relationship between e-cigarette flavor use and frequency of e-cigarette use among adult cigarette/e-cigarette dual users who attempted to quit smoking cigarettes. Analyses used Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study data from adult dual users (2015/16) who attempted to quit smoking between 2015/16 and 2016/17 (Wave 3-Wave 4, n = 685, including those who did/did not quit by 2016/17). E-cigarette flavor use (usual/last flavor, past 30-day flavor; assessed in 2015/16) was categorized into Only tobacco; Only menthol/mint; Only non-tobacco, non-menthol/mint; and Any combination of tobacco, menthol/mint, other flavor(s). The key outcome, evaluated at follow-up in 2016/17, was frequent e-cigarette use, which was defined as use on 20+ of past 30 days. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between e-cigarette flavor use in 2015/16 and frequent e-cigarette use at follow-up in 2016/17. Dual users who attempted to quit smoking had greater odds of frequent e-cigarette use at follow-up when they used only non-tobacco, non-menthol/mint flavor than when they used only tobacco flavor as their regular/last e-cigarette flavor (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.4); findings were no longer significant when adjusted for factors including e-cigarette device type (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 0.7-2.8). Past 30-day e-cigarette flavor use results were generally similar, although frequent e-cigarette use at follow-up was highest among those who used any combination of tobacco, menthol/mint, or other flavors. Findings indicate that e-cigarette flavor use among dual users who attempt to quit smoking may be related to e-cigarette use frequency overall, which may indicate a mechanism underlying findings for e-cigarette use and smoking cessation. Further longitudinal research may help to disentangle how e-cigarette characteristics uniquely impact e-cigarette use frequency and smoking cessation/sustained use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

To explore the key factors that served as facilitators or challenges to the passage of state T21 laws that apply to the sale of all tobacco products to anyone under 21 years of age, we conducted a comparative, cross-case study in ten states that adopted Tobacco 21 between 2016 and 2019. Stakeholders from selected states were identified via snowball sampling, and interviews were conducted from November 2018 to March 2020. Three primary factors emerged as facilitators to the passage of state T21 laws: (1) increased attention on e-cigarettes as the product driving an overall increase in youth tobacco use and depiction of an ""e-cigarette epidemic"", (2) having at least one influential policy entrepreneur or champion, and (3) traction from other states or local municipalities passing T21 legislation. Challenges to T21's success included (1) influence of the tobacco industry, (2) the bill's low ranking among legislative priorities, and (3) controversy among advocates and policymakers over bill language. As e-cigarette rates spiked, T21 bills became legislative priorities, traction from other successful efforts mounted, and ultimately, the tobacco industry flipped from opposing to supporting T21 laws. Despite these favorable headwinds, advocates struggled increasingly to pass bills with ideal policy language.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

HTP tobacco products are sold to consumers as a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes, both for users and bystanders. The actual impact of HTP on the health of users and its overall impact on public health is still not fully known. A systematic search of the literature was carried out to identify relevant studies published in English from 2015 to February 2021. The following databases were used: PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier and ClinicalKey. 25 studies (independent and sponsored by the tobacco industry) were considered. The analysis of exposure biomarkers and cardiovascular and respiratory biomarkers showed differences between smokers and people using heated tobacco products. Improvements in clinically relevant risk markers, especially cholesterol, sICAM-1, 8-epi-PGF2α, 11-DTX-B2, HDL and FEV1, were observed compared to persistent cigarette smokers. On the other hand, exposure to IQOS has been reported to alter mitochondrial function, which may further exaggerate airway inflammation, airway remodeling and lung cancer. These products have the potential to increase oxidative stress and increase respiratory tract infections by increasing microbial adherence to the respiratory tract. Our review suggests that HTP products may be products with a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and cancer compared to traditional smoking, although in the case of non-smokers so far, they may pose a risk of their occurrence.

Individual differences in the perceived susceptibility and seriousness of the virus, for people who smoke in general and for oneself personally, may relate to changes in smoking. Using the Health Belief Model (HBM) as a theoretical framework, we examined associations with self-reported increasing and decreasing smoking a lot during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period. Adults in 30 large U.S. cities who smoked cigarettes daily completed an online survey between 14 July and 30 November 2020. The analytic sample (N = 2768) was 54.0% male and 68.3% white with 23.7% reporting increasing and 11.3% decreasing smoking (6% reported both). Younger age, a diagnosis of COVID-19, and greater pandemic-related stress were associated with greater odds of both increased and decreased smoking. Increased smoking also was associated with heavier nicotine dependence, greater desire to quit, and greater perceived susceptibility and lower perceived seriousness of COVID-19 for people who smoke, while pandemic-related job-loss, lower nicotine dependence, and greater self-efficacy were associated with decreased smoking. Among respondents who had not contracted COVID-19 (n = 2418), correlates were similar with the addition of greater perceived personal susceptibility to COVID-19 associated with both increased and decreased smoking, while greater perceived personal seriousness of COVID-19 was associated with increased smoking. Findings for risk perceptions were largely in directions that contradict the HBM. Circumstances surrounding behavior change during the pandemic are complex and may be especially complex for nicotine addiction.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,Yes,

NVP knowledge may be important for providing accurate survey data, understanding the potential risks of NVP use, and assessing legal and regulated products. This paper examines current vapers who responded ""don't know"" (DK) regarding their NVP features. Data are from adult daily/weekly vapers in Waves Two (2018, n = 4192) and Three (2020, n = 3894) of the ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey. Analyses assessed DK responses for NVP features (e.g., type/appearance, nicotine) and consumption. A DK index score was computed based on the percent of all features with DK responses, which was tested for associations with demographics, smoking/vaping status, NVP features, purchase location, and knowledge of NVP relative risks. NVP description and appearance were easily identified, but DK was more common for features such as nicotine content (7.3-9.2%) and tank/cartridge volume capacity (26.6-30.0%). DK responses often differed by vaping/smoking status, NVP type/appearance, purchase location, and country. Vapers who are younger, use box-shaped NVPs, purchase online, and exclusive daily vapers were associated with lower DK index scores. Higher DK index scores were associated with poorer knowledge of relative health risks of NVP use. The diversity of the NVP market and wide variation in how products are used makes it challenging to capture information from users about device features, such as nicotine content and capacity, in population surveys.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

In response, the ENDS industry has taken actions to mobilize against public health measures, including coordination on social media platforms. To explore this phenomenon, data mining was used to collect public posts on two Facebook public group pages: the California Consumer Advocates for Smoke Free Alternatives Association (CCASAA) and the community page of the Northern California Chapter of SFATA (NC-SFATA). Posts were manually annotated to characterize themes associated with industry political interference and user interaction. We collected 288 posts from the NC-SFATA and 411 posts from CCASAA. A total of 522 (74.7%) posts were categorized as a form of political interference, with 339 posts (64.9%) from CCASAA and 183 posts (35.1%) from NC-SFATA. We identified three different categories of policy interference-related posts: (1) providing updates on ENDS-related policy at the federal, state, and local levels; (2) sharing opinions about ENDS-related policies; (3) posts related to scientific information related to vaping; and (4) calls to action to mobilize against tobacco/ENDS policies. Our findings indicate that pro-tobacco social media communities on Facebook, driven by strategic activities of trade associations and their members, may act as focal points for anti-policy information dissemination, grass-roots mobilization, and industry coordination that needs further research.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,Yes,

However, the controlled heating condition can drastically alter the inhaled aerosols' physical properties and chemical substances, causing potential health risks. To investigate the contribution of heating on aerosol properties, we used four common power settings in the mods to conduct a physicochemical analysis. Our data showed that the aerosol mass and nicotine content in the aerosols increased at high power. Additionally, high power led to aerosolization of a viscous component in the e-liquid, increasing the viscosity of aerosol. However, the pH of the aerosol was constant regardless of the applied power. In addition, high-power operation made nicotine prone to oxidation, resulting in the color of the aerosol turning yellow. Lastly, we demonstrated that e-cigarette aerosol could contain various metals, including aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, nickel, lead, and zinc. Even though these metal contents proportionally increased with the power setting, they remained far below the recommended exposure limits. Our finding demonstrates that the heating conditions of the e-cigarette change the physicochemical properties of the aerosols and their metal contents, thereby possibly affecting users' oral and respiratory systems.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We used data from a 2020 remote digital survey of an ongoing cohort study of young adults from Southern California (aged 19-23) to examine differences in pouch perceptions and use willingness across nicotine/tobacco use statuses. Participants who had never used nicotine pouches (N = 1167) viewed text/imagery from mass-marketed pouch packaging and advertising, then completed measures of willingness to use nicotine pouches, pouch harm perceptions, and hypothetical choice of cigarettes or e-cigarettes over pouches. Willingness to use pouches was significantly higher among non-combustible only (33.8%), combustible only (29.3%), and dual (43.9%) users than non-users (14.7%). Overall, 49.1% of participants were uncertain whether pouches were less harmful than cigarettes and 52.4% were uncertain whether pouches were less harmful than e-cigarettes. Relative harm perceptions did not significantly differ by tobacco use status. Those using non-combustible products (either alone or as part of dual use with combustible tobacco) had greater odds than non-users of reporting that they would use e-cigarettes over nicotine pouches. By contrast, all tobacco product user groups reported greater odds than non-users that they would use cigarettes over pouches. In sum, a sizable minority of young adults might be willing to try using nicotine pouches, but most are uncertain about the relative harm of pouches.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

We compared cardiovascular disease incidence in combustible-tobacco users, those who transitioned to ENDS use, and those who quit tobacco with never tobacco users. METHODS: This prospective cohort study analyzes five waves of Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study data, Wave 1 (2013-2014) through Wave 5 (2018-2019). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence was captured over three intervals (Waves 1 to 3, Waves 2 to 4, and Waves 3 to 5). Participants were adults (40+ years old) without a history of CVD for the first two waves of any interval. Change in tobacco use status, from exclusive past 30 day use of any combustible-tobacco product to either exclusive past 30 day ENDS use, dual past 30 day use of ENDS and combustible-tobacco, or no past 30 day use of any tobacco, between the first two waves of an interval was used to predict onset of CVD between the second and third waves in the interval. CVD incidence was defined as a new self-report of being told by a health professional that they had congestive heart failure, stroke, or a myocardial infarction. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses combined 10,548 observations across intervals from 7820 eligible respondents. RESULTS: Overall, there were 191 observations of CVD among 10,548 total observations (1.7%, standard error (SE) = 0.2), with 40 among 3014 never users of tobacco (1.5%, SE = 0.3). In multivariable models, CVD incidence was not significantly different for any tobacco user groups compared to never users. There were 126 observations of CVD among 6263 continuing exclusive combustible-tobacco users (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.44; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-2.39), 15 observations of CVD among 565 who transitioned to dual use (AOR = 1.85; 0.78-4.37), and 10 observations of CVD among 654 who quit using tobacco (AOR = 1.18; 0.33-4.26). There were no observations of CVD among 53 who transitioned to exclusive ENDS use. CONCLUSIONS: This study found no difference in CVD incidence by tobacco status over three 3 year intervals, even for tobacco quitters. It is possible that additional waves of PATH Study data, combined with information from other large longitudinal cohorts with careful tracking of ENDS use patterns may help to further clarify this relationship.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Neutral,Yes,

METHODS: Posts and comments (n = 166,169) between May 2019 and May 2020 on the subreddit r/JUUL were scraped using pushshift.io API. Keyword filters were used to identify texts discussing flavored ENDS products (n = 33,884 texts). These were further narrowed down to texts discussing flavor policy workaround strategies (n = 7429) and N-gram analysis was performed. Finally, findings from the N-gram analysis were triangulated through qualitative review of a separate sample of texts (n = 488) from the flavor policy-related posts and comments. RESULTS: Overall activity on the subreddit r/JUUL peaked around the time of the EVALI outbreak (September 2019) and when FDA issued guidance restricting flavored ENDS product sales (January 2020). The N-gram analysis revealed an active discussion of banned products one can ""still get"" or ""JUUL compatible"" alternatives, including specific brands, brick and mortar locations, and specific flavors. Ten dominant themes emerged from the qualitative review, with some posts containing more than one theme. CONCLUSION: Many users turned to Reddit for information related to the shifting regulatory landscape concerning flavored ENDS.

This paper examines recent ex-smokers' well-being related experiences overall and as a function of (1) duration of cessation and (2) continued nicotine use from vaping. METHODS: A sample of 1379 ever-daily smoking ex-smokers (quit for up to 5 years) from the 2020 ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey (Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US), of which 27.1% currently vaped daily. Well-being measures were perceived changes post-quitting in emotion coping (stress and negative emotions), enjoyment of life, and day-to-day functioning. We also assessed the level of persisting worry about past smoking leading to future health problems. RESULTS: Overall, among those answering all four well-being measures, 51.8% of the ex-smokers reported positive effects and no negatives, but 27.3% reported at least one negative effect, with the remainder reporting no change in any measure. Positive effects were greater among those who had quit more than 1 year prior. The largest improvement (56.3%) was for daily functioning, which showed improvement over time since having quit. Current daily vapers reported similar well-being as those not vaping; however, fewer daily vapers reported worsening ability to cope with stress (10.2% vs. 20.7%). Overall, 84% reported being worried about future negative health effects of smoking, with no clear differences by quitting duration or vaping status. CONCLUSIONS: Most ex-smokers reported changes in their well-being since quitting, with more reporting improvements than declines. Well-being improved with duration of time since quitting, but did not appear to be influenced by daily vaping use, but stress coping may be better among vapers. Persisting worries about possible future health effects from smoking may be reducing the experienced benefits of quitting smoking for some.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Materials & Methods: An online convenience sample of adult nicotine and/or cannabis vape users residing in the United States completed a 60 min survey on sociodemographic characteristics, cannabis and/or nicotine vape use behaviors and dependence, reasons for vape use, and perceptions of benefits and harms. After data cleaning, we compared dual vs. nicotine-only and cannabis-only vape users with univariate statistics and step-wise hierarchical linear regression analyses. Additionally, we assessed the factor structure, internal consistency, and criterion and convergent validity of the Penn State Cannabis Vaping Dependence Index (PSCVDI). Results: The final sample included 357 dual, 40 cannabis, and 106 nicotine vape users. Compared to nicotine- and cannabis-only vapers, dual vapers started using their nicotine and cannabis vapes at a younger age (p < 0.001), used them for more years (p < 0.001), and were less likely to use their nicotine vape to replace combustible cigarettes (p = 0.047). Dual users vs. single-substance users did not have significantly higher nicotine or cannabis vape dependence scores after controlling for sociodemographic and use behaviors. The PSCVDI showed adequate validity for measuring cannabis vape dependence. Conclusions: This survey is the first to highlight important differences in vape use behaviors and reasons for use between dual vs. cannabis- and nicotine-only vape users.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

A needs assessment was conducted to assess provider beliefs and opinions on tobacco treatment barriers and treatment approaches. The results highlighted a disconnect between the known importance of quitting smoking and barriers in linking patients to treatment, such as lack of patient interest and other patient issues being a higher priority. Using this assessment data, a treatment delivery approach, Proactive Outreach with Medication Opt-out for Tobacco Treatment Engagement (PrOMOTE), was devised and piloted. PrOMOTE consisted of an outpatient clinical pharmacist trained in tobacco treatment proactively contacting patients for counseling and to prescribe smoking cessation pharmacotherapy (varenicline or dual nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)) using an opt-out approach. The pilot was conducted with 10 PWH and patient reach and opt-out rates were evaluated. Of the 10 patients contacted, 7 were reached and none opted out of the pharmacotherapy prescription (varenicline = 6; NRT = 1). Providers know the importance of smoking cessation for PWH but encounter several barriers to implementing treatment. Using PrOMOTE methods to deliver tobacco treatment increased the reach and pharmacotherapy acceptance rate of PWH who smoke.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Herein, we present a public health decision-theoretic framework incorporating different patterns of HTP, NVP, and cigarette use to examine their impacts on population health. Our framework demonstrates that, for individuals who would have otherwise smoked, HTP use may provide public health benefits by enabling cessation or by discouraging smoking initiation and relapse. However, the benefits are reduced if more harmful HTP use replaces less harmful NVP use. HTP use may also negatively impact public health by encouraging smoking by otherwise non-smokers or by encouraging initiation or relapse into smoking. These patterns are directly influenced by industry behavior as well as public policy towards HTPs, NVPs, and cigarettes. While substantial research has been devoted to NVPs, much less is known about HTPs. Better information is needed to more precisely define the health risks of HTPs compared to cigarettes and NVPs, the relative appeal of HTPs to consumers, and the likelihood of later transitioning to smoking or quitting all products. While our analysis provides a framework for gaining that information, it also illustrates the complexities in distinguishing key factors.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Findings from the 2020 ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey.,"This study examined reasons why adults who currently smoke or formerly smoked cigarettes use nicotine vaping products (NVPs) by vaping frequency (daily vs. weekly) stratified by smoking status. This cross-sectional study included 3070 adults from the 2020 ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey (Australia, Canada, England, United States) who reported using a NVP (vaping) at least weekly and who either currently smoke (n = 2467) or formerly smoked (n = 603). Respondents were asked to select the reason(s) they use NVPs, including to manage their smoking (reduce/quit or remain quit) and/or for reasons unrelated to managing smoking (e.g., to save money, enjoyment, flavours). We found that both current and former smokers endorsed an average of six reasons for vaping, with those vaping daily reporting significantly more reasons than those vaping weekly. Among current smokers, 72.8% reported vaping may help them quit smoking, 13.0% reported vaping to reduce smoking but not to quit, and 14.2% reported vaping only for reasons other than to reduce or quit smoking. The most common reason for vaping among current smokers was to reduce smoking (81.3%). Current smokers vaping daily were significantly more likely than those vaping weekly to report using a NVP to reduce smoking, for enjoyment, to reduce harm to themselves and others, to quit smoking, likeable flavours, and to save money. The most common reason cited for vaping by respondents who formerly smoked was enjoyment, with those who vaped daily more likely than those who vaped weekly to report vaping for enjoyment and to reduce harm to themselves. Nearly all reported vaping to help stay abstinent from smoking (92.3%), with no significant difference by vaping frequency. In conclusion, a majority of respondents reported using NVPs to manage their smoking (reduce/quit smoking or remain quit), particularly those vaping daily. Those who were vaping daily also endorsed a greater number of reasons other than managing smoking relative to those who were vaping weekly.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

However, the rapid uptake of e-cigarettes among young people has prompted concern about company marketing practices. In 2019, there was no legislation to govern e-cigarette marketing in New Zealand. This period provides an ideal context for examining how e-cigarette companies promoted their products before the introduction of marketing regulations. We conducted a content analysis of the Instagram accounts of five prominent e-cigarette retailers based in New Zealand during 2019-2020. We assessed health- and risk-related claims and marketing techniques. Less than 10% of Instagram posts refer to smoking alternatives or risk of nicotine addiction. E-cigarette devices were more likely to be promoted for stylistic features such as colours and ease of use (29.7%). Music festival sponsorship (19.1%), social media influencers (9.2%), and lifestyle marketing (41.5%) were identified as youth-oriented promotional strategies. E-cigarette retailers claim to promote harm-reduction tools to smokers, yet this study finds few references to smoking alternatives in any content. Instead, retailers utilised strategies to engage with a young audience, including festival sponsorship and stylish influencers. This youth-oriented marketing, in combination with weak and delayed government action, may have contributed to the high use of e-cigarettes among young New Zealanders.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

These smokeless tobacco products are marketed for usage all over as snus containing tobacco-derived nicotine (natural) or as tobacco-free nicotine (synthetic) as substitutes for other tobacco products. Based on perception and socio-behavioral aspects, ONPs have become popular tobacco products among adolescents/young adults, and over 50% of young adult users of ONP use flavored ONPs, such as menthol/mint, tobacco, dessert/candy, and fruity, which are the most popular flavors. Various new ONP flavors are currently popular locally as well as in the online market. Tobacco, menthol, and fruit-flavored ONPs could motivate cigarette smokers to change to ONPs. METHODS: We expanded our knowledge on natural/synthetic ONP flavor wheels to available data on ONPs, describing, in detail, their flavors and brands (US and Europe) in both natural and synthetic ONP categories. We classified over 152 snus and 228 synthetic ONPs into the following flavor categories: ""Tobacco"", ""Menthol/Mint"", ""Fruity"", ""Candy/Deserts"", ""Drink"", ""Aroma"", ""Spices"", and ""Mixed Flavors"". RESULTS: Based on total numbers, we found the most popular ONP flavors, sold as tobacco and menthol, to be among natural ONPs; among synthetic ONPs, fruity and menthol are the most prominent flavors, with varying concentrations of nicotine and other flavoring chemicals, including coolant WS-23. We also showed possible molecular targets and toxicities, due to exposure to ONPs, activating several signaling cascades such as AKT and NF-kappaB, which might possibly lead to apoptosis and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the marketing of ONP products with various flavor profiles and with most of these products containing tobacco/menthol/fruit flavor, it is likely to have regulation and a marketing disclaimer on some of these products. Further, it would be logical to determine how the market reacts in terms of compliance and non-compliance with flavor restrictions by the regulatory agencies.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

A number of thirty cigarette brands have been analyzed. Six categorical (cigarette brand, manufacturer, health warnings, class) and four continuous (tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide concentrations and package price) variables were collected for investigation of chemical composition, market information and public health information. Multiple linear regression and two clusterization techniques have been applied. The study revealed interesting remarks. The carbon monoxide concentration proved to be linked with tar and nicotine concentration. The applied clusterization methods identified groups of cigarette brands that shown similar characteristics. The tar and carbon monoxide concentrations were the main criteria used in clusterization. An analysis of a largest sample could reveal more relevant and useful information regarding the similarities between cigarette brands.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

To date, multiple epidemiological and experimental studies have reported a variety of health issues associated with their use, including respiratory toxicity, exacerbation of respiratory conditions, and behavioral and physiological effects. While some of these effects appear to be sex- and/or gender-related, only a portion of the research has been conducted considering these variables. In this review, we sought to summarize the available literature on sex-specific effects and sex and gender differences, including predictors and risk factors, effects on organ systems, and behavioral effects. METHODS: We searched and selected articles from 2018-2023 that included sex as a variable or reported sex differences on e-cigarette-associated effects. RESULTS: We found 115 relevant studies published since 2018 that reported sex differences in a variety of outcomes. The main differences reported were related to reasons for initiation, including smoking history, types of devices and flavoring, polysubstance use, physiological responses to nicotine and toxicants in e-liquids, exacerbation of lung disease, and behavioral factors such as anxiety, depression, sexuality, and bullying. CONCLUSIONS: The available literature supports the notion that both sex and gender influence the susceptibility to the negative effects of e-cigarette use. Future research needs to consider sex and gender variables when addressing e-cigarette toxicity and other health-related consequences.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In addition, how taxes are passed through to SLT prices among states that impose specific taxes, and whether the pass-through rates for SLT are affected by the uptake and evolution of e-cigarettes, is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study will calculate the tax incidence on SLT and investigate how SLT taxes are passed to prices at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile levels, as well as whether these pass-through rates vary by e-cigarette uptake and evolution. METHODS: We regressed SLT prices on specific taxes using ordinary least square regressions while controlling for state-, year-, and quarter-fixed effects. We then tested the difference in tax pass-through rates by different periods. FINDINGS: The average tax incidence on chewing tobacco, moist snuff, dry snuff, and snus was 22%, 22%, 23%, and 20%, respectively. For moist snuff, taxes were fully passed to prices at the 25th and 50th percentiles (rate = 1.01, p < 0.001) and overly passed to prices at the 75th percentile (rate = 1.25, p < 0.001). The e-cigarette uptake and evolution significantly raised taxes by 13 cents and 14 cents per ounce, respectively, for moist snuff at the 75th percentile prices (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: If harm is considered a criterion for taxing tobacco products, the tax incidence on SLT could be further increased. Considering that lower-priced SLT have lower tax pass-through rates, price promotion restrictions and minimum pricing laws may be needed to increase the cost of lower-priced products. Additionally, we observed that tobacco companies tended to increase tax pass-through for premium SLT products as e-cigarettes gained popularity, which may indicate a strategic response to shifting consumer preferences.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This pilot study tested an 8-week intervention for smoking cessation after LCS. The participants (N = 40) were randomized to the intervention group (combination nicotine replacement therapy [NRT] plus gain-framed text messaging for 8 weeks) or the control group (standard cessation counseling) after LCS. Assessments were completed at 8-week and 3-month follow-ups, including self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence. The mean age was 64.4 years old (SD = 6.2); 32.5% were Black or African American; and 55% were female. At Week 8, 14.3% (3/21) of the participants in the intervention group were abstinent versus 0% (0/19) in the control group (p > 0.05). At 3-month follow-up, 4.8% (1/21) of the participants in the intervention group were abstinent versus 0% (0/19) in the control group. Among the intervention group participants, up to 52.4% used the provided patches and up to 61.9% used the provided lozenges during the study period. This study demonstrated modest quit rates for LCS patients receiving gain-framed text messages and NRT. The results highlight the need for more effective smoking cessation interventions for this priority population.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

The health risks of using e-cigarettes have been increasingly revealed; however, the health effects on non-users exposed to e-cigarettes are less known. Methods: A systematic review was conducted of peer-reviewed articles from 2004 to October 2024 from PubMed and Embase. We focused on the studies that described health outcome measures among non-smokers/vapers exposed to secondhand e-cigarettes. We excluded animal studies and those that did not include human participants. We also omitted studies with financial conflicts of interest with the tobacco industry. Results: Of the 8635 studies we found in our search, 16 were included in the final review. Study designs included in our review included a case study, a cohort, eight experimental, four cross-sectional studies, and two observational studies. Health outcome measures were self-reported health symptoms and biomarkers. Ten out of fourteen studies examined respiratory health risks, six described immunological effects, two examined cardiovascular risks, and one explored mental health effects. Self-reported health symptoms such as bronchitis, shortness of breath, asthma, throat irritations, ear infections, and mental health disorders were observed among secondhand e-cigarette exposures when compared with controls. Biomarker measures varied among studies, except for cotinine concentrations of non-smokers/vapers exposed to secondhand e-cigarettes, which were likely to be higher than non-exposed. However, all studies encountered potential limitations. Conclusions: Our review found that secondhand e-cigarette exposure is not harmless and may have negative health consequences. However, higher-quality prospective studies remain essential to examine long-term secondhand exposure.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Carried as runoff from streets to drains, to rivers, and ultimately to the ocean and its beaches, cigarette filters are the single most collected item in international beach cleanups each year. They are an environmental blight on streets, sidewalks, and other open areas. Rather than being a protective health device, cigarette filters are primarily a marketing tool to help sell 'safe' cigarettes. They are perceived by much of the public (especially current smokers) to reduce the health risks of smoking through technology. Filters have reduced the machine-measured yield of tar and nicotine from burning cigarettes, but there is controversy as to whether this has correspondingly reduced the disease burden of smoking to the population. Filters actually may serve to sustain smoking by making it seem less urgent for smokers to quit and easier for children to initiate smoking because of reduced irritation from early experimentation. Several options are available to reduce the environmental impact of cigarette butt waste, including developing biodegradable filters, increasing fines and penalties for littering butts, monetary deposits on filters, increasing availability of butt receptacles, and expanded public education. It may even be possible to ban the sale of filtered cigarettes altogether on the basis of their adverse environmental impact. This option may be attractive in coastal regions where beaches accumulate butt waste and where smoking indoors is increasingly prohibited. Additional research is needed on the various policy options, including behavioral research on the impact of banning the sale of filtered cigarettes altogether.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Interrogation of the oral transcriptome by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed significant number of aberrantly expressed transcripts in both e-cig users (vapers) and smokers relative to non-smokers; however, smokers had ~50% more differentially expressed transcripts than vapers (1726 versus 1152). Whereas the deregulated transcripts in smokers were predominately from protein-coding genes (79% versus 53% in vapers), nearly 28% of the aberrantly expressed transcripts in vapers (versus 8% in smokers) belonged to regulatory non-coding RNAs, including long intergenic non-coding, antisense, small nucleolar and misc RNA (P < 0.0001). Molecular pathway and functional network analyses revealed that ""cancer"" was the top disease associated with the deregulated genes in both e-cig users and smokers (~62% versus 79%). Examination of the canonical pathways and networks modulated in either e-cig users or smokers identified the ""Wnt/Ca⁺ pathway"" in vapers and the ""integrin signaling pathway"" in smokers as the most affected pathways. Amongst the overlapping functional pathways impacted in both e-cig users and smokers, the ""Rho family GTPases signaling pathway"" was the top disrupted pathway, although the number of affected targets was three times higher in smokers than vapers. In conclusion, we observed deregulation of critically important genes and associated molecular pathways in the oral epithelium of vapers that bears both resemblances and differences with that of smokers. Our findings have significant implications for public health and tobacco regulatory science.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Diabetes mellitus (DM) and arterial hypertension (AH) are underlying diseases of CKD. Genetic background, lifestyle, and xenobiotic exposures can favor CKD onset and trigger its underlying diseases. Cigarette smoking (CS) is a known modified risk factor for CKD. Compounds from tobacco combustion act through multi-mediated mechanisms that impair renal function. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) consumption, such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco devices, is growing worldwide. ENDS release mainly nicotine, humectants, and flavorings, which generate several byproducts when heated, including volatile organic compounds and ultrafine particles. The toxicity assessment of these products is emerging in human and experimental studies, but data are yet incipient to achieve truthful conclusions about their safety. To build up the knowledge about the effect of currently employed ENDS on the pathogenesis of CKD, cellular and molecular mechanisms of ENDS xenobiotic on DM, AH, and kidney functions were reviewed. Unraveling the toxic mechanisms of action and endpoints of ENDS exposures will contribute to the risk assessment and implementation of proper health and regulatory interventions.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Despite being used as an alternative to traditional smoking, many studies have reported their health risks and ineffectiveness in smoking cessation. The impact of e-cigarettes on weight control behaviours, a known effect of traditional cigarette smoking, is unclear. Herein, a systematic review was conducted to explore the relationship between e-cigarette use and body weight changes in adolescents and young adults. Methods: The existing literature from databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar until October 2023 was searched and included in the review. The methodological quality of all selected studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklists for Studies. Results: Out of 5117 citations, 20 publications featuring cross-sectional studies with adolescent participants were qualitatively analysed. The high rates of e-cigarette usage seemed to correlate with increased weight concerns, particularly among females. Regular e-cigarette users who reported being overweight and used calorie restriction for weight reduction were more likely to view vaping as a weight loss or control strategy. Young adults (<24 years) may consume more flavoured e-cigarettes than older users (>25 years). Conclusions: This study revealed a significant use of e-cigarettes among high school students, driven by taste preferences, weight management, and perceived harm reduction. Particularly among girls facing body image pressures, vaping serves as a weight control method. This highlights the need to assess cardiovascular risks and advocate for further research, including longitudinal studies, to inform public health strategies effectively.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Even though some of its systemic complications are common knowledge, the oral consequences are rarely known. Aim: Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the oral health effects of snus consumption among a highly exposed group of adolescent athletes. Design: Participants received an interactive presentation, followed by interviews and dental screenings by young doctors to establish trust. They were categorized into groups based on the frequency of snus usage. The oral hygiene habits and status, snus consumption habits, and awareness about its adverse effects were evaluated. Results: Statistically significantly (p < 0.05), more regular snus users experience gum bleeding while tooth brushing than nonusers (60% and 37%, p = 0.004). Snus consumption and poor oral hygiene have a cumulative effect on oral health. Some young athletes experience ulcerous oral mucosal lesions coinciding with snus placement. Nonusers exhibit greater awareness of the adverse effects of snus than regular users (27% and 49%). Conclusions: Regular snus use negatively affects oral health, especially the gums.

Currently, there is no effective clinical therapeutic strategy for HCC. Smoking is associated with several malignant diseases including cancers. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: However, the impact of smoking on HCC is still unresolved. Retrospectively reviewed HCC patients diagnosed between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2015 at Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital (Ministry of Health and Welfare). We found that smoking was associated with a poor prognosis, especially recurrence and patient survival after curative surgery using a clinicopathological analysis. RESULTS: Our univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR) was an oncogene and risk factor for post-resection recurrence. The α7-nAChR was overexpressed in HCC tissues compared to their non-tumor counterparts. Silencing the α7-nAChR reduced the viability of HCC cells, suppressed cellular proliferation, attenuated migration and invasion, and diminished the tumor's sphere-formation ability, with concurrent downregulation of expression levels of the TGR5, p-JAK2, p-STAT3 (Tyr705/Ser727), RhoA, ROCK1, MMP2, and MMP9 proteins. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between α7-nAChR and JAK2 expressions (p = 0.01) in HCC specimens, as well as their membranous co-localization. CONCLUSION: Together, we demonstrated that the α7-nAChR may be an independent prognosticator of the progression and prognosis of HCC patients. These findings suggest that the α7-nAChR drives the progression and recurrence of HCC through JAK2/STAT3 signaling and is a novel target for anti-HCC therapy.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This high salinity wastewater rich in ionic constituents and nicotine is difficult to be degraded by conventional biological treatment and is a serious threat that needs to be overcome. Electrodialysis (ED) has proved a feasible technique to remove the inorganic components in the papermaking wastewater. However, the fouling in ion exchange membranes causes deterioration of membranes, which causes a decrease in the flux and an increase in the electrical resistance of the membranes. In this study, the fouling potential of the membranes was analyzed by comparing the properties of the pristine and fouled ion exchange membranes. The physical and chemical properties of the ion exchange membranes were investigated in terms of electrical resistance, water content, and ion exchange capacity, as well as studied by infrared spectroscopy (IR) spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses. The results indicated that the membrane fouling is caused by two different mechanisms. For the anion exchange membranes, the fouling is mainly caused by the charged organic anions. For the cation exchange membrane, the fouling is caused by minerals such as Ca2+ and Mg2+. These metal ions reacted with OH- ions generated by water dissociation and precipitated on the membrane surface. The chemical cleaning with alkaline and acid could mitigate the fouling potential of the ion exchange membranes.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The high salinity and nicotine salts are challenging to be addressed by traditional treatment and are a severe threat that ought to be overcome. Thus, proper techniques can regenerate the tobacco stalks into reconstituted tobacco flakes used as cigarette filler. The electrodialysis process has been a viable approach to removing the inorganic ingredients in wastewater. We studied concentration, pH, and co-related influences with the nicotine and sugar/nicotine contents on the desalination performance. The results show that the inorganic ions such as Cl-, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions were successfully removed. When the feed concentration ranges from 3 to 15%, the removal ratio of the K+ ions is higher than Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. As we reported previously, the K+ and Ca2+ ions are unfavorable for the total particulate matter emission but beneficial to decreasing the HCN delivery in mainstream cigarette smoke.

The antigen could be a molecule expressed on a pathogen (e.g., a disease-causing bacterium, a virus or another microorganism), abnormal or damaged host cells (e.g., cancer cells), environmental agent (e.g., nicotine from a tobacco smoke), or an allergen (e.g., pollen or food protein). Immunogenic vaccines and therapies optimize the immune response to improve the eradication of the pathogen or damaged cells. In contrast, tolerogenic vaccines and therapies retrain or blunt the immune response to antigens, which are recognized by the immune system as harmful to the host. To optimize the immune response to either improve the immunogenicity or induce tolerance, researchers employ different routes of administration, antigen-delivery systems, and adjuvants. Nanocarriers and adjuvants are of particular interest to the fields of vaccines and immunotherapy as they allow for targeted delivery of the antigens and direct the immune response against these antigens in desirable direction (i.e., to either enhance immunogenicity or induce tolerance).

These wastes are usually disposed of through incineration or burial. However, these tobacco wastes still have some economic value. High-purity nicotine has a promising market outlook as the primary raw material for electronic cigarette liquid. Nicotine is not only found in tobacco leaves but also in the rhizomes of tobacco plants. This study presents a method for treating tobacco waste and extracting high-purity nicotine from it. After mixing the raw material powder and entrainer in specific ratios, as much of the nicotine in tobacco roots can be extracted as possible using supercritical carbon dioxide extraction. The effects of temperature, the ratio of the entrainer, and the volume fraction of ethanol in the entrainer on the nicotine yield in supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) at 25 MPa for 120 min were discussed. By using 90% ethanol (a raw material mass-to-volume ratio of 1:5) as the entrainer, we obtained the highest nicotine yield of 0.49% at 65 °C. Meanwhile, the purity of the crude extract was 61.71%, and after purification, it increased to 97.57%.

In this study conducted between 2019 and 2022, buyers aged 18 to 20 years made repeated unsupervised purchase attempts of cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, tobacco-free nicotine pouches, and smokeless tobacco at over 180 tobacco or e-cigarette retailers in New Jersey, New York City, and Pitt County (North Carolina). Buyers documented whether they were asked for identification and whether they were able to successfully purchase a tobacco or nicotine product at each visit. The primary outcome will be the percent of retailers that checked the buyers' identification at store visits and the percent of visits that resulted in a successful underage tobacco product purchase. We will compare the results across time periods, study sites, products, and buyer characteristics (i.e., gender, minoritized racial/ethnic identity) while controlling for repeated visits. These results will inform improvements to current compliance check inspection programs as well as interventions that reduce youth access to tobacco.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

This narrative review provides an outline of clinical evidence reported in the literature from the 1970s to 2025 that examines the efficacy of ketamine for the treatment of SUDs, focusing primarily on randomized blinded controlled trials (RBCTs). Key cohort studies, retrospective studies, secondary analyses, case reports, and relevant basic neuroscience studies are reviewed to complement the more rigorous human controlled trial data. Thus far, ketamine has been tested in nine RBCTs targeting cocaine (three studies), alcohol (three studies), opioid use disorder (two studies), and nicotine (one study), suggesting efficacy for addiction in combination with psychotherapies, and often when doses produce subjectively reported mystical or psychedelic experiences. This review highlights promising preliminary evidence, and the need for more rigorous studies to elucidate the scope of drug addictions ketamine may target, its optimal dosing or route of administration, the importance of concurrent psychotherapies, professional supervision and safety monitoring, and which psychiatric comorbidities or contexts may contraindicate its use for SUDs.",['Nicotine/NRT'],No,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Our repeat cross-sectional survey therefore assessed associations between use of e-cigarettes with past and planned future uptake of SSSs. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use was also assessed as a comparator. Participants were drawn from the Smoking Toolkit Study, a nationally representative, validated, face-to-face survey. Data were aggregated on 2139 English adults reporting current smoking of cigarettes or other tobacco products. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders. Results showed dual users of combustible tobacco and e-cigarettes were more likely than other smokers to report having accessed SSSs in the past (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.90) and intending to take up these services in future (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.00). Dual users of combustible tobacco and NRT showed similar associations. Secondary objectives provided evidence on key psychosocial factors that influenced smokers' decision-making in this area. In summary, despite speculation that e-cigarette use might deter smokers from accessing SSSs, our study found dual users of tobacco and e-cigarettes were more likely to report uptake of such services, compared to smokers not using e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

HTP sticks containing reconstituted tobacco come in various flavours such as menthol, citrus, etc., like electronic cigarette liquids. Thus, the composition of HTP aerosol will also vary according to the flavouring agents added. Overall, the content of toxic chemicals in HTP aerosol appears to be lower than in cigarette smoke. However, the concentrations of more than twenty harmful and potentially harmful constituents have been reported to be higher in HTP aerosol than in cigarette smoke. Further, several toxic compounds not detected in cigarette smoke are also reported in HTP aerosol. Thus, the risks of HTP use remain unknown. Most of the available data on the composition and health effects of mainstream HTP aerosol exposure are generated by the tobacco industry. Few independent studies have reported short-term pathophysiological effects of HTP use. Currently available HTP toxicity data are mainly on the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems. Moreover, there are no long-term toxicity data and, therefore, the claims of the tobacco industry regarding HTPs as a safer alternative to traditional combustible cigarettes are unsubstantiated. Furthermore, HTP aerosol contains the highly addictive substance nicotine, which is harmful to the adolescent brain, developing foetuses, pregnant women, and also adults. Hence, comprehensive studies addressing the safety profiling related to long-term HTP use are warranted. With this background, the following review summarizes the current state of knowledge on HTP toxicity on four broad lines: composition of mainstream HTP aerosol compared to traditional combustible cigarette smoke, biomarkers of HTP exposure, health effects of HTP exposure, and the harm reduction aspect.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Being neurotoxic, it poses potential risks for child health and learning. In Cuba, there is limited research on the association of secondhand smoke with children's brain health, especially in vulnerable populations like young children at home. The overall purpose of this study is two-fold. First, we determined the relationship between household smoke exposure and risks to brain health in Cuban children. Second, we analyzed the role of family environment factors, such as socio-economic status, in our estimates. Although this research represents the first investigation of its kind in Cuba, we expect to find evidence of neurotoxic associations with household smoke. We collected data between 2015 and 2018 using the medical records of 627 Cuban preschool children to explore the link between brain health indicators and exposure to tobacco smoke at home. We assessed archival reports on parental smoking, duration and frequency of exposure, and several indicators of brain health, including executive function, language development, sleep quality, and fluid intelligence. The findings indicate that exposure to tobacco smoke at home has a negative association with children's brain health, affecting both the cognitive (executive and linguistic functions) and non-cognitive aspects (sleep quality) of child development. Continuous exposure (five to seven times per week) and transient exposure (two to three times per week) were found to be more negatively related to sleep quality than in cognitive functions, particularly in children of middle socio-economic status.

Our previous studies revealed that nicotine treatment increases bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (BM-DC) cross-presentation and promotes BM-DC-based cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) priming. But the effect of nicotine on K48-linked ubiquitination and the mechanism of nicotine-increased BM-DC cross-presentation are still uncertain. In this study, we first demonstrated that ex vivo nicotine administration obviously increased K48-linked ubiquitination in BM-DC. Then, we found that K48-linked ubiquitination was essential for nicotine-augmented cross-presentation, BM-DC-based CTL priming, and thereby the superior cytolytic capacity of DC-activated CTL. Importantly, K48-linked ubiquitination was verified to be necessary for nicotine-augmented endosomal recruitments of p97 and Sec61. Importantly, mannose receptor (MR), which is an important antigenic receptor for cross-presentation, was exactly catalyzed with K48-linked ubiquitination by the treatment with nicotine. Thus, these data suggested that K48-linked ubiquitination contributes to the superior adaptive immunity of nicotine-administrated BM-DC. Regulating K48-linked ubiquitination might have therapeutic potential for DC-mediated immune therapy.",['Nicotine/NRT'],No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Most evidence on WP dependence to date has been derived from survey- or laboratory-based studies. This study employed qualitative methods to explore WP users' perceptions of dependence in Aleppo, Syria. METHODS: A total of 15 focus groups were conducted with 64 adult WP smokers (51 males and 13 females) using a semi-structured interview. All focus group discussions were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded using directed content analysis. FINDINGS: Several WP dependence features were consistent with those commonly reported by cigarette smokers. These included positively reinforced features, such as smoking's association with social gatherings and cultural connectedness, and negatively reinforced features including relief of withdrawal symptoms, stress, and boredom. Although interest in quitting was low, many users perceived quitting WP to be difficult and an indicator of loss of control over smoking, a common marker of dependence. Several observed dependence features were specific to WP, including transitioning from social smoking to smoking alone, and adapting one's behavior to the considerable effort normally required to engage in WP smoking despite inconvenience or cost, and often at the expense of other reinforcers such as social interaction. CONCLUSION: The general and specific features of WP dependence need to be considered in developing instruments to measure WP dependence, in clinical assessment of WP dependence, and in developing cessation programs.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

While Southeast Asian countries have received relatively little attention in e-cigarette research, the region represents an area of potentially untapped growth for the industry. We review the e-cigarette situation in Southeast Asia in terms of the e-cigarette markets, advertising and promotion of e-cigarettes, reported health impacts of e-cigarette use, and policy responses in the region. METHODS: We examined e-cigarette market data from the Euromonitor Global Market Information Database (GMID) Passport database, searched in the academic literature, grey literature and news archives for any reports or studies of e-cigarette related diseases or injuries, e-cigarette marketing, and e-cigarette policy responses in Southeast Asian countries, and browsed the websites of online e-cigarette retailers catering to the region's active e-cigarette markets. RESULTS: In 2019, e-cigarettes were sold in six Southeast Asian markets with a total market value of $595 million, projected to grow to $766 million by 2023. E-commerce is a significant and growing sales channel in the region, with most of the popular or featured brands in online shops originating from China. Southeast Asian youth are targeted with a wide variety of flavours, trendy designs and point of sale promotions, and several e-cigarette related injuries and diseases have been reported in the region. Policy responses vary considerably between countries, ranging from strict bans to no or partial regulations. CONCLUSION: Although Southeast Asia's e-cigarette market is relatively nascent, this is likely to change if transnationals invest more heavily in the region. Populous countries with weak e-cigarette regulations, notably Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines, are desirable targets for the transnationals. Regulatory action is needed to prevent e-cigarette use from becoming entrenched into these societies, especially among young people.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Recent investments by trans-national tobacco corporations (TTCs) in electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) has raised concerns that industry actors may be using these to re-engage policy-makers in ways precluded by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) Article 5.3. METHODS: This article examines tobacco industry engagement with the United Kingdom House of Commons Science and Technology Committee (STC) inquiry into e-cigarettes. It draws on a qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with committee members and support staff (n=4) triangulated against written and oral evidence submissions. RESULTS: TTCs featured prominently in the STC inquiry via written and oral submissions. Opportunities existed for industry engagement, and potential influence, at each stage of the process. There was an absence of oral testimony from those sceptical about the potential health benefits of ENDS. The governance mechanisms in place for select committees appear inadequate for protecting committee work from industry influence. As it relates to TTCs, this has implications for the UK's commitments under FCTC Article 5.3, yet understanding of the FCTC and the requirements of Article 5.3 compliance within the committee were limited. CONCLUSION: The governance of select committees requires urgent reform in order to balance norms of openness and participation with the need to protect their work from power of economic actors with conflicts of interest (COI). This is particularly the case in relation to TTCs and adherence to FCTC Article 5.3. These findings are of relevance to other select committees whose work affects the interests of HHIs. Further research is needed on other committees and sectors.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, preparative 2D-LC aimed at isolating compounds is significantly different compared with one-dimensional liquid chromatography (1D-LC) in terms of method development and system configuration; thus, it is less developed than its analytical counterpart. The use of 2D-LC in large-scale product preparation has rarely been reported. Hence, a preparative 2D-LC system was developed in this study. The system was composed of one set of preparative LC modules as a separation system, with a dilution pump, switch valves, and trap column array as the interface, to enable the simultaneous isolation of several compounds. Tobacco was used as a sample, and the developed system was applied to isolate nicotine, chlorogenic acid, rutin, and solanesol. The chromatographic conditions were developed by investigating the trapping efficiency of different types of trap column packings, and chromatographic behaviors under different overload conditions. The four compounds were isolated in one 2D-LC run with high purity. The developed system features low cost because it employs medium-pressure isolation, excellent automation owing to its use of an online column switch, high stability, and capability for large-scale production. The isolation of chemicals from tobacco leaves as pharmaceutical raw materials could aid in the development of the tobacco industry and promote the local agricultural economy.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

They are devices that use an electronic heat source to heat tobacco and produce aerosols containing nicotine for smokers to inhale. Currently, traditional combustible cigarettes and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are increasingly being regulated under the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Tobacco companies have responded by actively promoting heated tobacco products worldwide, which pose new challenges to global tobacco control efforts and may become a challenge for tobacco control work in China. In reviewing the situation and the potential harm of heated tobacco products, it was noted that HTP are rapidly gaining popularity worldwide, and that their harmfulness may be underestimated. Compared to combustible cigarettes (CC) and ENDS, the long-term health effects of HTP are not fully understood, and they may pose new health risks. Potential health risks include an increase in smoking prevalence, the presence of harmful and potentially harmful compounds not found in CC, and the potential gateway effect on non-smokers. Due to differences in laws, regulations, health policies, institutions, and cultural factors related to the tobacco industry in different countries and regions, attitudes, and regulatory measures towards HTP also vary. It is essential for countries and regions around the world to develop appropriate policies to strengthen control of HTP and prevent their widespread use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The relevant data of smoking and relapsing in residents aged ≥15 years were collected by face-to-face interview. Software SAS 9.4 was used to clean and analyze the data, and logistic regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors for relapse rate. Results: A total of 19 376 questionnaires were completed, with a response rate of 91.50%. In 2018, 66.05% of smokers aged ≥15 years in China had smoking relapse, in whom 66.59% were males and 55.79% were females.

Ex vivo suppression of receptor-mediated immune responses in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated with smoke constituents is an attractive approach to study mechanisms and evaluate the likely long-term effects of exposure to tobacco products. Here, we optimized methods to perform ex vivo assays using PBMCs stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a Toll-like receptor-4 ligand. The effects of whole smoke-conditioned medium (WS-CM), a combustible tobacco product preparation (TPP), and nicotine were investigated on cytokine secretion and target cell killing by PBMCs in the ex vivo assays. We show that secreted cytokines IFN-γ, TNF, IL-10, IL-6, and IL-8 and intracellular cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, and MIP-1α were suppressed in WS-CM-exposed PBMCs. The cytolytic function of effector PBMCs, as determined by a K562 target cell killing assay was also reduced by exposure to WS-CM; nicotine was minimally effective in these assays. In summary, we present a set of improved assays to evaluate the effects of TPPs in ex vivo assays, and these methods could be readily adapted for testing other products of interest.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

HT cannot be considered as a cigarette cessation product and was even designed as a product to initiate or return to tobacco consumption. To promote this product, the tobacco industry essentially exploits the concept of harm reduction and, as such, tries in its commercial communication to create confusion between HT and electronic cigarettes, despite these two products having nothing in common. This promotion is based, on the one hand, on the data of internal studies in contradiction with those of independent studies, and, on the other, illegally, on social networks and communication in contradiction with the statements of regulation authorities.

What makes it hard for them to quit smoking nonetheless? Tobacco companies insist that smokers choose to smoke, according to their right to self-determination. Moreover, they insist that with motivation and willpower to quit smoking, smokers can easily stop smoking. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to discuss the addictive disease called tobacco use disorder, with an assessment of the addictiveness of tobacco and the reasons why smoking cessation is challenging, based on neuroscientific research. Nicotine that enters the body via smoking is rapidly transmitted to the central nervous system and causes various effects, including an arousal response. The changes in the nicotine receptors in the brain due to continuous smoking lead to addiction symptoms such as tolerance, craving, and withdrawal. Compared with other addictive substances, including alcohol and opioids, tobacco is more likely to cause dependence in smokers, and smokers are less likely to recover from their dependence. Moreover, the thinning of the cerebral cortex and the decrease in cognitive functions that occur with aging accelerate with smoking. Such changes occur in the structure and functions of the brain in proportion to the amount and period of smoking. In particular, abnormalities in the neural circuits that control cognition and decision-making cause loss of the ability to exert self-control and autonomy. This initiates nicotine dependence and the continuation of addictive behaviors. Therefore, smoking is considered to be a behavior that is repeated due to dependence on an addictive substance, nicotine, instead of one's choice by free will.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Owing to advertisements stating that HTPs are odorless, tar-free, and less harmful to health, the sales of HTPs have grown quickly enough to account for about 10% of the total tobacco market in a year. HTP use by young, highly educated, and high-income groups had a significant impact on both the overall tobacco market over the past 3 years and the smoking and quitting behaviors of smokers. Based on national smoking rate statistics, tobacco sales trends, and the number of visitors to smoking cessation clinics, the following changes have been identified: (1) The decline in current smoking rates has slowed or rose in some groups. (2) The decline in total cigarette sales has slowed but rose again in the first quarter of 2020. (3) The number of visitors to smoking cessation clinics decreased just after the advent of HTPs. These results may be due to the insufficient support of tobacco regulation policies but also coincide chronologically with the appearance of HTPs in South Korea. It is necessary to investigate the usage rate of various tobacco products, including HTPs and e-cigarettes, to examine the health risks of novel tobacco products and provide accurate information to users and policymakers. Finally, tobacco companies are continuously developing new product concepts to escape the regulation of existing cigarettes; thus, comprehensive management measures for all nicotine-containing products are needed.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Logistic regression was used to model prolonged abstinence from smoking (ascertained by self-report and breath carbon monoxide testing) as a function of treatment, baseline ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS) score, change in ADHD-RS score during treatment, and their interactions. RESULTS: Treatment interacted with both ADHD-RS score at baseline (P = .01) and change in ADHD-RS score during treatment (P = .008). Among patients with higher ADHD-RS scores (> 36) at baseline and the most improvement in ADHD during treatment (ADHD-RS change score ≥ 24), 70.0% of those who took OROS methylphenidate achieved abstinence from smoking compared to 36.8% of those who took placebo (P = .02). In contrast, among patients with the lowest ADHD-RS baseline scores (≤ 30), 30.3% of those who took OROS methylphenidate achieved abstinence from smoking compared to 60.7% of those who took placebo (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: OROS methylphenidate, in combination with nicotine patch, may be an effective treatment for nicotine dependence among smokers with more severe ADHD and more robust response of ADHD symptoms to medication. OROS methylphenidate may be counterproductive among smokers with lower severity of ADHD.

Ever since, Indians have used tobacco in various forms. Sixty five per cent of all men and 33% of all women use tobacco in some form. Tobacco causes over 20 categories of fatal and disabling diseases including oral cancer. By 2020 it is predicted that tobacco will account for 13% of all deaths in India. A major step has to be taken to control what the World Health Organization, has labeled a 'smoking epidemic' in developing countries. India's anti-tobacco legislation, first passed in 1975, was largely limited to health warnings and proved to be insufficient. A new piece of national legislation, proposed in 2001, represents an advance including banning smoking in public places, advertising and forbidding sale of tobacco to minors. Preventing the use of tobacco in various forms as well as treating nicotine addiction is the major concern of dentists and physicians. The dental encounter probably constitutes a ""teachable moment"" when the patient is receptive to counseling about life- style issues. Both policy makers and health professionals must work together for achieving a smoke free society for our coming generations.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

This study assessed dual use and identified associated factors of usage in school-going youth in the high tobacco burdened region of rural Appalachian Tennessee. METHODS: Two waves of data for the same cohort of students were collected in 2014 (Wave 1) and 2016 (Wave 2). Dual use of e-cigarettes with any other tobacco product was the dependent variable. The independent variables consisted of exposure to tobacco use at home, home smoking rules, smoking inside the vehicle, attitudes toward smoking, exposure to tobacco industry marketing/promotion, and peer/family pressure. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the prevalence of dual use and delineate factors associated with usage. RESULTS: Dual use increased from 13.3% in Wave 1 to 18.6% in Wave 2. Results of logistic regression show that exposure to tobacco industry marketing/promotion was significantly associated with dual use in the two waves, odds ratio (OR) = 4.18 (confidence interval [CI] = 1.69-10.38) and OR = 4.43 (CI = 2.03-9.67), respectively. While allowing smoking inside the vehicles, sometimes, significantly increased dual use in Wave 1 (OR = 3.18 [CI = 1.19-8.48]), exposure to tobacco use at home (OR = 2.94 [1.24-6.97]), and peer/family pressure (OR = 2.92 [1.87-7.19]) increased usage in Wave 2. CONCLUSION: The increasing trend in dual use of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products among youth in Appalachia Tennessee suggests a critical need for comprehensive tobacco control programs to avert exacerbating disparities in tobacco use and tobacco-related diseases in the US.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

On an average, they roll around 600 bidis/day and are exposed to 120 g of tobacco and 3 g of nicotine. Bidis do not have chemical preservatives or stabilizing agents, and therefore, the rollers are exposed only to nicotine by handling and inhalation. The study objective was to assess pregnancy outcome in these women with occupational tobacco exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study of bidi-rollers (n = 177) and women with no tobacco exposure (n = 354), followed up for pregnancy outcome, neonatal anthropometry, and nicotine absorption by cotinine assays. Adjusted risk and adjusted mean differences with a 95% confidence interval were derived. RESULTS: Outcomes included increased adjusted risk for gestational hypertension (3.54 [1.21, 10.31]; P = 0.021) and fetal growth restriction (2.71 [1.39, 5.29]; P = 0.004). Risk for prematurity was not statistically significant (1.81 [0.74, 4.45]; P = 0.194). Lower adjusted mean difference of birth weight (-104 g [-177, -31]; P = 0.005), length (-0.4 cm [-0.8, -0.1]; P = 0.006), and head circumference (-0.4 cm [-0.6, -0.1]; P = 0.002) were seen with increased risk for small for gestational age (1.75 [1.12, 2.73]; P = 0.015). Nicotine absorption was evident in one-third of maternal and cord blood estimations.

OBJECTIVES: This integrative review aims to throw some light on the effect of ECs on human health and determine the safety of ECs with or without nicotine with long-term usage. METHODS: This integrative review includes findings from Randomized and non-randomized clinical trials, and laboratory-based Human studies; published in the English language in the last four years. Literature search sources were online databases such as PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar. Results: Following systematic search using inclusion and exclusion criteria, 21 articles were included in the final review. ECs result in an acute increase in cardiac Sympathetic Nerve Activity (SNA), pronounced as Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes resulting in a greater risk of sudden death for those with co-morbidities. ECs with or without nicotine can adversely affect lung function and can precipitate obstructive pulmonary diseases. ECs may also adversely affect oral health due to increased bacterial pathogenicity and periodontitis. At last, these nicotine-containing ECs can yield nicotine comparable to Traditional cigarettes (TCs) and sometimes to a much greater extent, thus posing the threat of the user becoming nicotine dependent. CONCLUSION: Although ECs are less harmful than TCs in combustible inhaled constituents, their long-term safety can still not be ascertained due to the scarcity of long-term studies and conflicting results.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,Yes,

Two previous rounds of the global youth tobacco survey (GYTS) found that a significant proportion of Thai youth currently smoke. OBJECTIVES: We conducted the third round of GYTS in Thailand in 2015 to monitor trends in tobacco use. METHODS: We selected 31 public and private secondary schools using random sampling based on probability proportional to school enrolment. In each school, we selected 1-3 classes (Grades 7-9) by random sampling. All students in these classes from 30 schools (one school declined) completed a self-administered standard questionnaire in the Thai language. The association between tobacco use and independent variables was examined using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 1876 students, 1721 were aged 13-15 years. Overall, 15% of students currently used tobacco; boys 21.8% and girls 8.1%. The prevalence of current cigarette smoking was 11.3%; 3.3% students currently used electronic cigarettes. Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) at home, school, and in enclosed public places was reported by 33.8%, 47.9%, and 38.6%, respectively. Among current smokers, 44% were not stopped from purchasing cigarettes despite being underage. Higher tobacco use was associated with being older, male, exposed to SHS, in possession of an object with a tobacco logo, and being offered a free tobacco product by a tobacco company. CONCLUSION: Tobacco and cigarette use among Thai students remains high. Underage current smokers have easy access to cigarettes. Urgent steps are needed to curb the access of youth to tobacco.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

These are often flavored to make them more attractive for youth - ENDS use may lead young nonsmokers to take up tobacco products. Neither safety nor efficacy as a cessation aid of ENDS has been scientifically demonstrated. The adverse health effects of secondhand aerosol cannot be ruled out. Weak regulation of these products might contribute to the expansion of the ENDS market - in which tobacco companies have a substantial stake - potentially renormalizing smoking habits and negating years of intense tobacco control campaigning. The current situation calls for galvanizing policy makers to gear up to this challenge in the Southeast Asia Region (SEAR) where the high burden of tobacco use is compounded by large proportion of young vulnerable population and limited established tobacco cessation facilities. Banning ENDS in the SEAR seems to be the most plausible approach at present. In the SEAR, Timor-Leste, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Thailand have taken the lead in banning these products. The other countries of the SEAR should follow suit. The SEAR countries may, however, choose to revise their strategy if unbiased scientific evidence emerges about efficacy of ENDS as a tobacco cessation aid. ENDS industry must show true motivation and willingness to develop and test ENDS as effective pharmaceutical tools in the regional context before asking for market authorization.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Once viewed predominantly as a male habit, tobacco consumption among Indian women has seen a rising trend. This shift is driven by factors such as evolving societal norms, aggressive marketing by the tobacco industry, and increasing urbanization. Women are now using a variety of tobacco products, including smokeless tobacco and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). The health effects are particularly alarming, with elevated risks for cancers, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory conditions, and reproductive health problems. Despite these concerns, public health initiatives and policies often fail to address the specific needs of women. editorial examines the social and cultural drivers of tobacco use among Indian women, outlines the severe health risks, and calls for immediate action through gender-sensitive tobacco control policies.

This study aimed to assess indoor smoking in the workplace as part of a smoke-free policy implementation and the factors associated. This was a cross-sectional study at workplaces in Indonesia from October 2019 to January 2020. The workplaces were divided into private workplaces owned by a company for business and government workplaces that run for public services. Samples were selected using stratified random sampling. Data collection follows time and area observation guidelines, starting in the indoor area and then outdoor. The observation was conducted for at least 20 min for each workplace in 41 districts/cities. Of the 2900 observed workplaces, 1097 (37.8%) were private and 1803 (62.92%) were government workplaces. The proportion of indoor smoking at government workplaces was 34.7%, higher compared to private (14.4%). The results were consistent for each indicator such as people smoking (14.7% vs. 4.5%), electronic cigarette use (0.7% vs. 0.4%), cigarette butts presence (25.8% vs. 9.5%), and smell of cigarette smoke (23.0% vs. 8.6%). The factors associated with indoor smoking were indoor ashtray availability (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =13.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.6-17.5), indoor designated smoking area (AOR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.4-4.0), presence of indoor tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorships (AOR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.3-8.89), whereas the presence of no smoking sign was a preventive factor (AOR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.5-0.8).

Effective midstream school-based prevention activities delay youth use. Worksite programs and physician ""quit smoking"" advice can be cost-effective, although these are not sufficiently widespread. Community strategies show promise of preventing youth use and helping addicted users quit. Despite failed federal tobacco control legislation, great strides have been made upstream, including proposed regulation of nicotine as a drug, the state master settlement agreement with the tobacco industry, and excise tax increases funding statewide tobacco control programs. Wider dissemination of effective programs and better coordination with upstream policies hold great potential to significantly reduce future use rates and related disease.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

APPROACH: A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted. SETTING: Study setting comprised seven transitional homeless shelters with indoor smoke-free policies in San Diego County; facilities differed in outdoor restrictions on smoking. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-six current or former smokers were the study participants. METHOD: Participants completed a questionnaire on smoking behaviors, perceived antitobacco norms, and attitudes toward smoke-free policies, and attended a focus group interview that explored these topics. We used a directed content analysis approach to analyze the focus group transcripts. RESULTS: Clients in facilities with outdoor restrictions on smoking had stronger perceived antitobacco norms than those in facilities without such restrictions. We identified the following major themes: attitudes toward smoke-free policies, the use of e-cigarettes, the addictive potential of cigarettes, vulnerability to tobacco industry marketing, and interest in smoking cessation. The consensus was that smoke-free policies were important because they limited secondhand smoke exposure to nonsmokers and children. All were curious about e-cigarettes, particularly if they could be smoked in areas where smoking was prohibited and/or used as a cessation aid. CONCLUSION: In this study of homeless adults, there was strong support for indoor and outdoor smoke-free policies. However, misperceptions that e-cigarettes could be used indoors could threaten antitobacco norms, highlighting opportunities to educate about the potential risks of e-cigarette use among homeless individuals.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are considered relatively safe, thus tobacco and nicotine delivery products have become popular in the last few years. However, the safety of long-term use of these products on oral health is still questionable. E-cigarettes may have potential risks to oral health that can be demonstrated as cellular damage, genetic instability, and mucosal lesions. This review aims to observe the role of e-cigarettes as a risk factor for oral cancer development. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines to provide reliable data on the role of electronic cigarettes as a risk factor for oral cancer development. The research was performed on Pubmed and Scopus by three reviewers from the Oral Pathology Department (Sapienza University of Rome) in May 2024. The search terms included: ""e-cigarette"", ""oral cancer"", and ""risk factor"" where 32 articles from PubMed and 75 from Scopus were collected. A total of 12 studies met the eligibility criteria: 6 clinical studies and 6 in vitro. All the included studies were subjected to quality assessment and data extraction processes. The risk of bias assessment of in vitro studies revealed low or unknown risk. None of the studies had any industrial sponsoring and almost all the papers (90%) had the same methods, 64% measured the cell vitality. The qualitative analysis was done for all the included clinical studies using the RoB assessment tool (MINORS). The range of the total RoB score in the comparative studies was between 12 and 23. RESULTS: The clinical studies involved a total of 413 participants were also included. Most studies did not specify the age and gender of participants and patients were divided into three main groups based on specific criteria: non-smokers, smokers, and e-cigarette users. These studies highlighted cases of mucosal lesions and genetic instability associated with e-cigarette use. CONCLUSIONS: However, the limited long-term data and conflicting results emphasize the need for a larger number of studies, such as randomized controlled trials and cohort studies, to acquire more data about the safety and risks associated with e-cigarettes.

Findings suggest ENDS to be probably less harmful than combustible cigarettes, but evidence on long-term health effects is still lacking. The potential risk reduction by using tobacco heating systems instead of combustible cigarettes has largely been studied by tobacco industry-sponsored research. Evidence on the extent of risk reduction is key for risk-adapted taxation policies, which will be discussed soon in the Swiss parliament. Evidence on the effects of tax policies in the USA shows that the level of taxation of ENDS, tobacco heating systems and combustible cigarettes has an effect on switches between these products. Therefore, excise taxes influencing one another need to be considered. In Switzerland, tobacco heating systems are currently taxed at a level of 12%, whereas ENDS are not subject to tobacco excise taxation as yet, because they do not meet the legal definition of a tobacco product. This article analyses approaches for imposing taxes on tobacco and nicotine products and possible outcomes, depending on the intended public health goals. At least three tax models can be considered. Tax model A would apply a very small tax on ENDS and a higher tax for tobacco products, which could increase incentives for smokers to switch to vaping but comes with risks of increased vaping initiation among the youth and subsequent switch to or dual use of tobacco products. In contrast, model B would levy a moderate tax on ENDS and an increased tax on tobacco products, which could limit initiation among youth, incentivise to switch from smoking to vaping and discourage dual use. In model C, a comparable tax level for ENDS, tobacco heating systems and combustible cigarettes is levied. This could have overall positive effects in reducing tobacco- and nicotine-associated burden of disease by discouraging initiation in youth, overall consumption and dual use, but could discourage switching to less harmful products. When applying these tax models to current sales prices of these products we found that no public health goal, such as protecting youth and reducing tobacco-associated morbidity and mortality can be achieved. The price of tobacco products is too low to achieve any price differentiation that reflects the different risks associated with ENDS and tobacco products. In order to achieve any public health goal with one of these tax models, prices for tobacco products need to be increased substantially.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

DESIGN: The data were compiled from volunteers who participated in clinical studies at a contract research organization in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. INTERVENTIONS: Data were collected from 5,018 male and female recreational opioid users via telephone and face-to-face screening interviews. Five recreational opioid users participated in a live interview broadcast on the internet. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic data, recreational drug use history, routes of recreational drug administration, alcohol use, and smoking status. A subset of the demographic information and recreational drug use history was summarized separately using data collected between 2013 and 2016 from 114 recreational opioid users who were not dependent on opioids. Interview excerpts were included from five recreational opioid users who described their real-world experiences with drug abuse, including the impact of abuse-deterrent opioid formulations on their drug abuse behavior. RESULTS: The preferred route of administration of opioids was oral (52 percent), followed by intranasal (36 percent), intravenous (10 percent), and buccal (chewing on a patch; 2 percent). Other substances used included nicotine, alcohol, and non-opioid psychoactive drugs (primarily cannabis). Oxycodone was the most frequently reported opioid of abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Recreational opioid users have distinct drug-related behaviors and preferences. Monitoring current trends and examining these behaviors is an important component to understand the potential safety risks associated with recreational opioid use.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

EC manufacturers have suggested that ""vaping"" is a safer alternative to conventional smoking because of the potential reduction of exposure to toxic substances. In 2019, National Youth Tobacco Survey reported that 10.5% and 27.5% of middle and high school students used ECs in the previous 30 days (0.6% and 1.5% in 2011, 3.3% and 11.7% in 2017, and 4.9% and 20.8 in 2018), respectively. Increased EC use among younger individuals is mainly because of the widespread perception that ECs are relatively less harmful than conventional cigarettes as they do not involve smoking tobacco and contain little or no nicotine. This review suggests that ECs may not be completely harmless. There are increasing number of case reports on various complications arising from using ECs, which are especially popular among young individuals and could negatively affect their health. Reported complications include lipoid pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, multiple reactive pulmonary nodules, subacute bronchiolitis, mouth and tongue injuries, dental injuries, complex facial fractures, thermal injuries, nickel contact allergy, C1 and C2 fractures, and fatal intoxication after ingesting liquids. Complications that develop directly from the substances in the devices and those resulting from device explosion and burning are being reported with increasing frequency. There is an urgent need for legislation and restriction regarding the sale of these devices considering their increasing frequency of use by younger individuals.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This study aimed to evaluate the success of evidence-based pharmacological treatments and behavioral/cognitive training in patients who failed to quit smoking with e-cigarettes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 109 consecutive patients with failed attempts at smoking cessation by e-cigarettes were admitted. A questionnaire was administered to evaluate the demographic characteristics and smoking habits. Nicotine dependence scores of the smokers were obtained using the Fagerström addiction test. Appropriate pharmacological therapy and behavioral/cognitive training were given to each patient who failed to quit smoking with e-cigarettes. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 35.2±10.4 years, and 89 (81.7%) were men. Education level was high school or university for 92 (84.4%) patients; only 17 (15.6%) graduated from middle school. The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day was 25.8±10.8, and the mean nicotine dependence score was 6.7±1.9. Only 6 (5.5%) individuals quit smoking temporarily after using e-cigarettes, with a mean restarting time of 3.3±2.0 months in all 6 patients. The smoking cessation rate in our study was 43.1% (47 patients) with medical treatment. The remaining individuals were unable to quit smoking with pharmacological treatment, and the mean restarting time for these patients was 10.4±2.2 months. CONCLUSION: It has been shown that the success rate of smoking cessation increases with pharmacological treatment and behavioral/cognitive training in individuals who failed to quit smoking with e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Among the key factors contributing to increased use is tobacco marketing, including advertising emphasizing flavored products, which influences perceptions, especially among youth. In Georgia, recent efforts have strengthened tobacco control, with the ""new generation"" tobacco control legislation adopted in 2017. Consequently, the trend of individual tobacco product (for example cigarettes) consumption has decreased. However, 2019 researches shows that the trend of using novel tobacco products among young people is increasing. The share of novel tobacco products in the market of Georgia started to grow largely in 2019. Perhaps relatedly, youth continue to show high rates of tobacco consumption in Georgia. The primary aim of this study is to investigate/analyze Georgia's responses to addressing tobacco use in youth and identify gaps and challenges of Georgian policy regarding the regulation of novel tobacco products through comparisons with European policy approaches. METHODS: This study identified policy documents specifying legislation (e.g., laws and bylaws, government documents, including state strategies and working plans, official announcements, and minutes from official meetings), through Internet search engines, official legislative web pages, and Ministry websites. Comparative analysis was used to identify challenges in the tobacco control policy of Georgia and assess its alignment with international standards. We compared the features of the Georgian policy with key measures for regulating novel tobacco products outlined in the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and European Union (EU) legislation (e.g Regulating tobacco product content and disclosure; Packaging and labelling of tobacco products; Tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, tobacco industry interfare in tobacco control policy, etc.). RESULTS: Considering the analysis of effective policy characteristics for preventing tobacco use among young people, as outlined by the WHO and the EU, it is evident that Georgia's tobacco control legislation has significant gaps. Youth prevention policies addressing these products are relatively weak. The current legislation does not include restrictions on marketing of novel tobacco products emphasizing flavors, nor does it include restrictions or limitations on using flavorings/additives in any type of tobacco. Only the concentration of emitted substances in cigarettes and amount of nicotine in e-cigarette liquid is limited. However, compliance with these requirements has never been assessed; There is no local laboratory that tests any kind of tobacco product and no samples have ever been sent to any laboratory abroad. ENNDS represent a particular policy challenge, as they are not considered as tobacco products, and no tobacco control legislative requirements apply to them. Tobacco industry interference with Georgia's tobacco legislation has also been documented to be high; Thus, it is likely that introduction of the control policies on novel product will be met with great resistance, especially since no research has yet been conducted recent years to reveal rates of novel tobacco products use by youth. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first assessment regarding how Georgia has responded to the growing popularity of novel tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes and HTPs, indicating that its tobacco control legislation has mainly addressed traditional tobacco products but largely neglected these novel products. The tobacco industry has taken advantage of the policy loopholes, and Georgia has become a favorable market for the novel tobacco product industry in recent years. Current findings provide evidence for decision-makers to inform the development of effective regulation and enformcement mechanism of flavored novel tobacco products, as gaps in the current regulations will likely will lead to increased use, particularly among youth.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In recent years, the popularity of newer recreational nicotine products has surged drastically in many countries, raising health and safety concerns. For decades, the tobacco industry has promoted the myth that nicotine is as harmless as caffeine. Nonetheless, evidence shows that nicotine is far from innocuous, even on its own. In fact, numerous studies have demonstrated that nicotine can harm multiple organs, including the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Tobacco and recreational nicotine products are commercialized in various types and forms, delivering varying levels of nicotine along with other toxic compounds. These products deliver nicotine in profiles that can initiate and perpetuate addiction, especially in young populations. Notably, some electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and heated tobacco products (HTP) can deliver concentrations of nicotine that are comparable to those of traditional cigarettes. Despite being regularly advertised as such, ENDS and HTP have demonstrated limited effectiveness as tobacco cessation aids in real-world settings. Furthermore, ENDS have also been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In contrast, nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) are proven to be safe and effective medications for tobacco cessation. NRTs are designed to release nicotine in a slow and controlled manner, thereby minimizing the potential for abuse. Moreover, the long-term safety of NRTs has been extensively studied and documented. The vast majority of tobacco and nicotine products available in the market currently contain nicotine derived from tobacco leaves. However, advancements in the chemical synthesis of nicotine have introduced an economically viable alternative source. The tobacco industry has been exploiting synthetic nicotine to circumvent existing tobacco control laws and regulations. The emergence of newer tobacco and recreational nicotine products, along with synthetic nicotine, pose a tangible threat to established tobacco control policies. Nicotine regulations need to be responsive to address these evolving challenges. As such, governments should regulate all tobacco and non-medical nicotine products through a global, comprehensive, and consistent approach in order to safeguard tobacco control progress in past decades.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The secretion of neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline, serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, gamma-amino-butyric acid and glutamate is increased by the binding of nicotine to central nicotine receptors. There are also data showing that serotonin formation and secretion in patients with mental illness are influenced by chronic smoking. Cigarette smoke inhibits the activity of monoamine oxidase B, which is responsible for the catabolism of several brain neurotransmitters. Patients suffering from major depression show a comorbidity between heavy smoking and the disease. In patients with schizophrenia treated with neuroleptics, increased cigarette smoking reduces adverse reactions to the drug therapy presumably because of an increase in metabolism of the neuroleptics. There is also evidence suggesting that quitting smoking is more difficult for mentally ill patients than patients without psychiatric disease. Several studies have been carried out on smoking cessation in psychiatric patients. The alternative method of harm reduction, e.g. reducing the number of cigarettes smoked using nicotine patches or chewing gum, is necessary in patients not able to quit. The data indicate that strategies such as the coupling of smoking prohibition with administration of nicotine preparations are useful in smoking cessation. A no-smoking policy in psychiatric clinics, even when this leads to withdrawal symptoms in the patients affected, has no negative effect on mental illness. Because patients with mental diseases are particularly vulnerable to the marketing strategies of the tobacco industry, this chronically ill section of the population requires special protection by the law-makers.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

This study focuses on identifying the types and characteristics of tobacco products besides cigarettes available and used in Republic of Korea (ROK), as well as anticipating products that are likely to enter the country in the future. The study investigated the official websites and social media channels of major tobacco manufacturers and analyzed recently sold electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) by visiting offline stores. New tobacco products have been launched using marketing messages like odor reduction and reduced harm, while smokeless tobacco products are sold in various types. Tobacco companies are using “smoke-free” expressions to describe the lower risk of new tobacco products compared to conventional cigarettes. The devices of heated tobacco products provide a cleaner and more convenient smoking experience, with a growing number of flavors. E-cigarettes have become very diverse, with over 40 types of devices and 200 types of liquids sold in a single store, classified according to the method of inhaling, nicotine content, and flavor and aroma. Future tobacco products anticipated in ROK is “nicotine pouch” which is similar to snus and contains nicotine powder instead of tobacco leaves. The emergence of such new tobacco products will bring changes in the tobacco use behavior of Korean smokers who frequently use multiple tobacco products, and as there is a possibility that new health hazards may occur as a result, regulatory policies should be prepared by creating scientific evidence such as health impact studies.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We used US retail scanner data to assess national and state-specific trends in e-cigarette unit sales and prices for 4 product types sold from 2012 through 2016. METHODS: Using retail scanner data from the 48 contiguous states and Washington, DC, for convenience stores; supermarkets; mass merchandisers; drug, dollar, and club stores; and military commissaries, we assessed data on monthly unit sales and inflation-adjusted prices by 4 products (rechargeables, disposables, prefilled cartridges, and e-liquids) sold during the 5-year study period. We evaluated national and state trends by using Joinpoint regression (P < .05). RESULTS: From 2012 through 2016, average national monthly unit sales significantly increased for all products, while average monthly prices of rechargeables, disposables, and prefilled cartridges significantly decreased. In 2016, prefilled cartridges had the highest average sales (766 units per 100,000 people) and the lowest average price ($14.36 per unit). By state, average monthly sales significantly increased for at least 1 of 4 e-cigarette products in all 48 states and Washington, DC. However, during the same period, average monthly prices significantly decreased in 39 states for rechargeables, in 31 states for disposables, in 20 states for prefilled cartridges, and in 8 states for e-liquids. CONCLUSION: Overall, US e-cigarette unit sales generally increased as product prices decreased. These findings demonstrate the rapidly evolving landscape of US e-cigarette retail marketplace. Ongoing surveillance of e-cigarette unit sales and price is critical for informing and evaluating evidence-based tobacco control strategies.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We assessed manufacturer-reported nicotine yield in cigarettes sold in the United States from 2013 to 2016. METHODS: We merged machine-measured nicotine yield in cigarette smoke and pack characteristics obtained from reports filed by tobacco manufacturers with the Federal Trade Commission for 2013-2016 with monthly Nielsen data on US cigarette sales. Manufacturer-reported, sales-weighted, average annual nicotine yield was assessed, as were nicotine yield sales trends by quartile: markedly low (0.10-0.60 mg/stick), low (0.61-0.80 mg/stick), moderate (0.81-0.90 mg/stick), and high (0.91-3.00 mg/stick). Trends in overall, menthol, and nonmenthol pack sales, by nicotine yield quartiles over the study period and by year, were determined by using Joinpoint regression. RESULTS: During 2013-2016, average annual sales-weighted nicotine yield for all cigarettes increased from 0.903 mg/stick (95% CI, 0.882-0.925) in 2013 to 0.938 mg/stick (95% CI, 0.915-0.962) in 2016 (P < .05). For menthol cigarettes, yield increased from 0.943 mg/stick in 2013 (95% CI, 0.909-0.977) to 1.037 mg/stick in 2016 (95% CI, 0.993-1.081), increasing 0.2% each month (P < .05). Most pack sales occurred among high (41.5%) and low (30.7%) nicotine yield quartiles. Cigarette sales for the markedly low quartile decreased by an average of 0.4% each month during 2013-2016 (P < .05). CONCLUSION: During 2013-2016, manufacturer-reported, sales-weighted nicotine yield in cigarettes increased, most notably for menthol cigarettes. Continued monitoring of nicotine yield and content in cigarettes can inform tobacco control strategies.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: A Web-based experiment randomized 1062 smokers to see advertisements for alternative nicotine products or soft drinks, then complete a series of purchase tasks, which were used to estimate demand elasticity, peak consumption, and cross-price elasticity (CPE) for tobacco products. RESULTS: Lower demand elasticity and greater peak consumption were seen for cigarettes compared to all alternative products (p < .05). CPE did not differ across the alternative products (p ≤ .03). Seeing relevant advertisements was not significantly related to demand.

METHODS: Adult smokers (N = 1324) completed online cross-sectional surveys. Logistic regression evaluated predictors of dual use and cigarette quit attempts. RESULTS: Smokeless tobacco dual use was associated with past attempts to quit smoking by switching to smokeless products. E-cigarette dual use was associated with using stop-smoking medication and strong anti-tobacco industry attitudes. Ever use of stop-smoking medication was associated with quit attempts among dual e-cigarette users and cigarette-only users. CONCLUSIONS: Dual users are more likely than cigarette-only users to endorse certain cessation-related attitudes and behaviors.

Tweets advocating Juul were most common; meanwhile a handful of tweets discouraged Juul use. Young women, young men, and the tobacco industry expressed positive sentiments about Juul. Conclusions: Twitter data are a rich source of public communication to complement surveillance of emerging tobacco products. Youth actively and positively communicate about Juul on Twitter. Educational content and strategies must be examined for curtailing dissemination of positive sentiments and advocacy that normalize and promote Juul use among youth and non-smokers.

Methods: An experiment (N = 715 high school youth) varied the warning label participants viewed (FDA warning label/ MarkTen warning label/ abstract warning label) and whether they viewed the label alone or alongside MRS and/or flavors. Results: Drawing upon the Heuristic Systematic Model, we found that youth who view an MRS with any of the warning labels are more likely to engage in counterarguing (compared to the FDA warning label alone), which increases risk perceptions. Additionally, the greater youth perceive the risks associated with e-cigarettes, the lower their intentions of using them, even if they have tried an e-cigarette in the past. Conclusions: Tobacco education and public health messages should encourage youth to evaluate the tobacco industry messages they receive, as counterarguing is associated with higher risk perceptions. Furthermore, fostering increased awareness of the risks associated with e-cigarette use by youth can reduce intentions to use them.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Post California's 2022 flavor ban, leading oral nicotine pouch (ONP) brand (ZYN) started marketing two new ""unflavored"" products, Classic and Original, but it is unknown if they differed from pre-ban products marketed as ""flavor-ban approved"" (Chill and Smooth) in their chemical composition, sensory characteristics and human appeal. METHODS: Nicotine, menthol, and synthetic coolants, WS-3 and WS-23, were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Menthol receptors (TRPM8 and TRPA1) activity was measured by calcium-microfluorimetry to assess cooling-and irritation-potential. ONP sensory attributes and appeal were assessed in young-adults (21-25Yr old) after 5-minute standardized use in a double-blind, randomized remote trial. RESULTS: ""Chill"" and ""Classic"" ONPs contained WS-3 exclusively (0.24±0.02 mg/pouch), with consistent levels across nicotine strengths; ""Smooth"" and ""Original"" contained neither menthol nor WS-3. Extracts of ""Chill"" and ""Classic"" robustly activated the cold/menthol TRPM8-receptor with similar potency and efficacy, while weakly activating the sensory irritant TRPA1 receptor. Human participants rated ""Chill"" and ""Classic"" as having stronger cooling sensations (p<0.05), while ""Classic"" was rated as more minty flavored when compared to unflavored ""Smooth"" and ""Original"" (p<0.005) ONPs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Pre- and post-ban ONPs showed similar chemical, sensory, and appeal profiles based on WS-3 presence. By using concept names and sensory cues to disguise flavors, industry exploits regulatory loopholes to sustain marketing of banned products. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC: Oral nicotine pouches (ONPs) have gained popularity among young adults, and manufacturers have introduced products and marketed as ""ban-compliant"" with concept names and sensory additives that may mimic flavors despite flavor bans. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Chemical, receptor, and sensory analyses of pre- and post-ban ZYN ONPs showed both contained the synthetic coolant WS-3, producing flavor-like cooling sensations even without menthol or other flavor compounds. HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH PRACTICE OR POLICY: Findings indicate that post-ban ONPs retain the same sensory and chemical properties as pre-ban products, highlighting enforcement challenges when odorless sensory additives and branding strategies allow products to retain flavor-like effects despite legislative restrictions.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Little is known about these relationships in South Africa (SA). OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between nicotine dependence, SES, lifestyle behaviours and lifetime quit attempts among adult smokers in SA. METHODS: This study used data from 2 651 participants aged ≥16 years in the 2011 South African Social Attitudes Survey. Information on SES (measured by asset ownership), binge drinking, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, intention to quit smoking and lifetime quit attempts was extracted. Nicotine dependence was measured using the Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI). All data were weighted to account for the complex survey design and to yield nationally representative estimates. Data analysis included binary logistic regression with high nicotine dependence (HND) defined as HSI ≥4 and lifetime quit attempts as separate outcomes. RESULTS: The prevalence of smoking was 20.1% (31.6% for males and 9.5% for females), and was highest in the mixed-ancestry group (37.0%). Overall, 14.5% of smokers had HND, with a higher proportion in the high-SES group. The odds of HND increased with every 10 years of smoking history (odds ratio (OR) 2.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 - 3.00) but decreased among participants who reported frequent physical activity (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.18 - 0.86) and those who planned to quit (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.19 - 0.75). Quit attempts were more likely among participants who reported frequent fruit and vegetable intake (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.07 - 2.98) and less likely among those reporting binge drinking (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.16 - 0.59) or assessed as having HND (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.17 - 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: Most adult smokers in SA have low nicotine dependence. However, the association of HND with high SES in this study suggests that although cessation treatment based on an integrated lifestyle behavioural intervention package may suffice for most smokers, a more intense cessation treatment package is needed for smokers of higher SES.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

OBJECTIVES: To assess trends in sociodemographic patterns in the use of TNPs and the extent to which sociodemographic factors and non-cigarette tobacco use may explain possible changes in rates of TNP use between 2017/18 and 2021. METHODS: Data from three waves (2017, 2018 and 2021) of the South African Social Attitudes Survey (total N=8 140) were analysed. The sociodemographic correlates of current daily and non-daily use of factory-manufactured cigarettes (FMCs), roll-your-own (RYO) cigarettes, waterpipe/hubbly, electronic cigarettes (ECigs), snuff (a smokeless tobacco) and any combination of FMCs, RYO cigarettes and waterpipe/hubbly ('current smoking') in 2017/18 (pre-pandemic) were compared with those for 2021 (during the pandemic). Chi-square analyses and generalised linear models were used to compare the prevalence of TNP use between the two periods. A Blinda-Oaxaca decomposition analysis was also used to explore the roles of various sociodemographic factors, including any differences in the use of TNPs, that may explain any observed differences in smoking rates between 2017/18 and 2021. RESULTS: Current smoking increased significantly from 22.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 20.4 - 24.5) in 2017/18 to 27.6% (95% CI 24.3 - 31.1) in 2021 (p=0.009). Smoking of FMCs did not change significantly overall between these two periods (20.1% v. 22.1%; p=0.240), except for a significant increase among those who self-identified as black African and a decrease among those who self-identified as coloured and those currently employed. However, the use of waterpipe/hubbly, ECigs, RYO cigarettes and snuff increased significantly. Women, individuals aged <35 years and black Africans had the largest increase in waterpipe/hubbly and ECig use. A decomposition analysis showed that increased waterpipe/hubbly and RYO use explained 52% and 15%, respectively, of the increase in smoking rates, while lower employment during 2021 compared with 2017/18 explained 15% of the increase in smoking rates during 2021. CONCLUSION: The use of all TNPs continued to increase in SA, particularly among women and unemployed people. These findings have policy and practice implications for addressing socioeconomic disparities in tobacco-related diseases.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

DESIGN: Parallel randomized, placebo-controlled trial from September 2004 to February 2008. Participants and all research personnel except the database manager were blinded to randomization. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00364156) SETTING: Academic center. PARTICIPANTS: 568 adult smokers. INTERVENTION: In an unstratified small block-randomization scheme, participants were randomly assigned to standard therapy (Nicoderm CQ [GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina], 21 mg, for 8 weeks and placebo for 16 weeks) or extended therapy (Nicoderm CQ, 21 mg, for 24 weeks). MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence at weeks 24 and 52. Secondary outcomes were continuous and prolonged abstinence, lapse and recovery events, cost per additional quitter, and side effects and adherence. RESULTS: At week 24, extended therapy produced higher rates of point-prevalence abstinence (31.6% vs. 20.3%; odds ratio, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.23 to 2.66]; P = 0.002), prolonged abstinence (41.5% vs. 26.9%; odds ratio, 1.97 [CI, 1.38 to 2.82]; P = 0.001), and continuous abstinence (19.2% vs. 12.6%; odds ratio, 1.64 [CI, 1.04 to 2.60]; P = 0.032) versus standard therapy. Extended therapy reduced the risk for lapse (hazard ratio, 0.77 [CI, 0.63 to 0.95]; P = 0.013) and increased the chances of recovery from lapses (hazard ratio, 1.47 [CI, 1.17 to 1.84]; P = 0.001). Time to relapse was slower with extended versus standard therapy (hazard ratio, 0.50 [CI, 0.35 to 0.73]; P < 0.001). At week 52, extended therapy produced higher quit rates for prolonged abstinence only (P = 0.027). No differences in side effects and adverse events between groups were found at the extended-treatment assessment. LIMITATION: The generalizability of the findings may be limited because participants were smokers without medical comorbid conditions who were seeking treatment, and differences in adherence across treatment groups were detected. CONCLUSION: Transdermal nicotine for 24 weeks increased biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence and continuous abstinence at week 24, reduced the risk for smoking lapses, and increased the likelihood of recovery to abstinence after a lapse compared with 8 weeks of transdermal nicotine therapy.

An example from the Smoke Free Class Competition in Italy.,"Tobacco smoking by young people is of great concern because it usually leads to regular smoking, nicotine addiction and quitting difficulties. Young people ""hooked"" by tobacco maintain the profits of the tobacco industry by replacing smokers who quit or die. If new generations could be tobacco-free, as supported by tobacco endgame strategies, the tobacco epidemic could end within decades. Smoking prevention programmes for teens are offered by schools with the aim to prevent or delay smoking onset. Among these, the Smoke Free Class Competition (SFC) was widely implemented in Europe. Its effectiveness yielded conflicting results, but it was only evaluated at short/medium term (6 - 18 months). The aim of this study is to evaluate its effectiveness after a longer follow-up (3 to 5 years) in order to allow enough time for the maturing of the students and the internalization of the experience and its contents. Fifteen classes were randomly sampled from two Italian high schools of Bologna province that regularly offered the SFC to first year students; 382 students (174 participating in the SFC and 208 controls) were retrospectively followed-up and provided their ""smoking histories"". At the end of their last year of school (after 5 years from the SFC), the percentage of students who stated that they were regular smokers was lower among the SFC students than in controls: 13.5% vs 32.9% (p=0.03). From the students' ""smoking histories"", statistically significant protective ORs were observed for SFC students at the end of 1st and 5th year: 0.42 (95% CI 0.19-0.93) and 0.32 (95% CI 0.11-0.91) respectively. Absence of smokers in the family was also a strongly statistically significant factor associated with being a non-smoker student. These results suggest that SFC may have a positive impact on lowering the prevalence of smoking in the long term (5 years).","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In Italy, 26% of the population smokes and the high prevalence of smoking even among young people is crucial for the Tobacco Industry, because young people are the reservoir which replaces smokers who quit or die. The aim of this study is to investigate smoking habits and determinants of smoking among young adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled young people from three Italian regions: Latium (central Italy) Calabria (southern Italy) and Sicily (the largest Italian island). An anonymous, multiple-choice online questionnaire was distributed through social networks. Questions investigated individual habits and lifestyles (smoking, alcohol and coffee consumption, physical activity), the presence of smokers in the family and the use of electronic cigarettes. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were used to describe the characteristics of the sample and to evaluate factors associated with smoking status. All statistical analyses were conducted in SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). All hypothesis tests were 2-tailed and p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In a sample of 382 subjects between 18 and 34 years, the prevalence of smoking was 25%. A statistically significant higher percentage of smokers is observed among those who drink coffee and those who drink alcohol. Only 48% of smokers usually smoke classic cigarettes, while 45% roll their own cigarettes and 7% use electronic cigarettes. More than half of the smokers, smoke 1 to 5 cigarettes a day, while 17% smoke over 10 cigarettes a day. In families where there was at least 1 smoker, the percentage of smokers was 34% versus only 15% in families where nobody else smokes. The presence of at least 1 smoker in the family was strongly associated with young adults' smoking behavior: subjects with family members who smoke were more than three times as likely to be current smokers, compared to those with no family smokers (Odds Ratio [OR] = 3.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-5.5, p=0.0001). Alcohol, coffee consumption, unemployment and being a student were also found to be independently and significantly associated with smoking of young adults (alcohol OR=2.96, 95%CI 1.64-5.34; coffee OR= 4.33, 95%CI 1.81-10.39; unemployment OR = 4.76, 95%CI 1.26-17.96; being a student OR = 3.21, 95%CI 1.25-8.27). CONCLUSION: Preventing young people from smoking is crucial in order to stop the Tobacco Epidemic. The Tobacco Industry is selling new products and is using new marketing tactics (i.e. the ""influencers"" in social media) which are hooking young people to addictive products and behaviors, thus threatening to wipe out decades of progress in curbing tobacco use. Effective action to drastically reduce new and old types of smoking or to pursue the ""Tobacco Endgame"" requires an increasing commitment not only towards young people, but also towards families, that play an important role in influencing young people.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: We exploited a strong within-family design, that is, the discordant monozygotic twin design, to study reactiveness of DNA methylation in blood cells to smoking and reversibility of methylation patterns upon quitting smoking. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip data were available for 769 monozygotic twin pairs (mean age = 36 years, range = 18-78, 70% female), including pairs discordant or concordant for current or former smoking. RESULTS: In pairs discordant for current smoking, 13 differentially methylated CpGs were found between current smoking twins and their genetically identical co-twin who never smoked. Top sites include multiple CpGs in CACNA1D and GNG12, which encode subunits of a calcium voltage-gated channel and G protein, respectively. These proteins interact with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, suggesting that methylation levels at these CpGs might be reactive to nicotine exposure. All 13 CpGs have been previously associated with smoking in unrelated individuals and data from monozygotic pairs discordant for former smoking indicated that methylation patterns are to a large extent reversible upon smoking cessation. We further showed that differences in smoking level exposure for monozygotic twins who are both current smokers but differ in the number of cigarettes they smoke are reflected in their DNA methylation profiles. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, by analysing data from monozygotic twins, we robustly demonstrate that DNA methylation level in human blood cells is reactive to cigarette smoking.

This service operated for five years before the government's decision to set up smoking cessation services. METHOD: A postal survey was undertaken of 800 clients. RESULTS: 193 people responded. Of these, 132 (68 per cent) claimed to be helped by the service. Proactive telephone contact, carbon monoxide monitoring, the six-week course, nicotine replacement therapy, and reading materials were well received. Thirty six per cent of the respondents were not smoking at the time of the survey. CONCLUSION: Nursing staff are increasingly expected to provide smoking cessation support. The government is funding this work and monitoring the number of clients helped, rather than the quality of the service.

However, smokers intending to quit may find long-term abstinence challenging. When smoking an electronic cigarette (EC), users can experience a sensation and taste similar to that of smoking a combustible cigarette. Therefore, manufacturers promote these products as a viable substitute for combustible cigarettes. However, several researchers report the serious health impacts experienced by EC users. Therefore, this review aims to examine the health impacts of EC use. Based on the findings of the research papers reported in the literature, the role of EC as a smoking cessation tool is unclear. Several researchers have also reported a significant association between EC usage among non-smokers at baseline and the future initiation of combustible cigarette smoking. EC use significantly impacts user health. The nicotine that is present in EC e-liquids can elevate blood pressure, resulting in blood vessel constriction and an increase in heart rate, ultimately leading the body to an ischemic condition, resulting in myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and increased arterial stiffness. Researchers report a higher likelihood of prediabetes among EC users; its usage was associated with higher OR of having asthma attacks and higher OR of reporting depression and has an impact on birth outcomes among pregnant women. Men using EC are more likely to report erectile dysfunction than non-users. EC also has a significant impact on oral health, which includes periodontal diseases, mucosal lesions, irritation in the mouth and throat, reduced salivary flow, and an increased risk of developing cancer. The physical injury resulting from exploding EC is another health concern. The frequently burned areas included the hands, face, genitalia, and thighs. Marketers promote EC as an alternative to combustible cigarettes and a tool for quitting smoking. However, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved them for smoking cessation. EC can have a serious impact on the health of their users; hence, the findings of this paper have several implications, including the need for regulation of the sales and marketing of these products and educating the users on the impact of these products on their health and safety.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

This survey assessed motivation to stop smoking in Germany and barriers to quitting smoking or switching to two types of smoke-free products (SFPs): e-cigarettes (E-cigs) and heated tobacco products (HTPs). METHODS: In 2022, computer-assisted web interviews were conducted among adults (>19 years) who smoked (n=1,000) or used SFPs (n=196). RESULTS: Overall, 51.2% of people who smoke were not motivated to stop smoking, 29.1% reported an intention to quit in the following year, and the remainder had some desire to quit but had not decided when to try. Lack of motivation was highest among people who smoke aged >65 years (64.4%) and lowest among those aged 19-34 years (38.9%). People with lower socioeconomic status who smoked had less motivation to quit than those with a higher socioeconomic status. In the sample of people who smoke, the barriers to quitting smoking included enjoyment of smoking (50.1%), difficulty in changing habits (41.4%), and lack of discipline (31.2%), with key differences among age groups. Only 27.3% of people who smoke perceived E-cigs/HTPs to have lower health risks relative to cigarettes, versus 84.7% of SFP users. Among SFP users, 41.8% reported a period of dual use when switching away from cigarettes. For the vast majority (89.1%), this period lasted less than a year, and 96.3% reported reduced cigarette consumption during this phase. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the well-known health risks, a large number of people in Germany continue to smoke, with many not motivated to quit. The primary barrier to quitting is the enjoyment of smoking. Additionally, there are misperceptions about the relative risks of cigarettes versus SFPs among people who smoke. To effectively reduce smoking prevalence, targeted campaigns must address these barriers and correct these misperceptions. Existing tobacco control strategies should be supplemented with tobacco harm reduction approaches to drive down smoking prevalence as quickly as possible.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,Yes,['Philip Morris International'],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

The Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline Panel, Staff, and Consortium Representatives.","OBJECTIVE: To summarize the recently published US Public Health Service report Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: A Clinical Practice Guideline, which provides recommendations for brief clinical interventions, intensive clinical interventions, and system changes to promote the treatment of tobacco dependence. PARTICIPANTS: An independent panel of 18 scientists, clinicians, consumers, and methodologists selected by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. A consortium of 7 governmental and nonprofit organizations sponsored the update. EVIDENCE: Approximately 6000 English-language, peer-reviewed articles and abstracts, published between 1975 and 1999, were reviewed for data that addressed assessment and treatment of tobacco dependence. This literature served as the basis for more than 50 meta-analyses. CONSENSUS PROCESS: One panel meeting and numerous conference calls and staff meetings were held to evaluate meta-analytic and other results, to synthesize the results, and to develop recommendations. The updated guideline was then externally reviewed by more than 70 experts and revised. CONCLUSIONS: This evidence-based, updated guideline provides specific recommendations regarding brief and intensive tobacco cessation interventions as well as system-level changes designed to promote the assessment and treatment of tobacco use. Brief clinical approaches for patients willing and unwilling to quit are described. Major conclusions and recommendations include: (1) Tobacco dependence is a chronic condition that warrants repeated treatment until long-term or permanent abstinence is achieved. (2) Effective treatments for tobacco dependence exist and all tobacco users should be offered those treatments. (3) Clinicians and health care delivery systems must institutionalize the consistent identification, documentation, and treatment of every tobacco user at every visit. (4) Brief tobacco dependence treatment is effective, and every tobacco user should be offered at least brief treatment. (5) There is a strong dose-response relationship between the intensity of tobacco dependence counseling and its effectiveness. (6) Three types of counseling were found to be especially effective-practical counseling, social support as part of treatment, and social support arranged outside of treatment. (7) Five first-line pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence-sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride, nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, and nicotine patch-are effective, and at least 1 of these medications should be prescribed in the absence of contraindications. (8) Tobacco dependence treatments are cost-effective relative to other medical and disease prevention interventions; as such, all health insurance plans should include as a reimbursed benefit the counseling and pharmacotherapeutic treatments identified as effective in the updated guideline.

The tobacco cessation program was conducted at 20 primary care clinics in northeastern and central Pennsylvania. We gauged the successfulness of the program by the patients' self-reported quit rates at 1 year. We also examined the association between quit rates and compliance with scheduled counseling visits, the impact of the availability of an HMO pharmacy benefit that supported the costs of nicotine replacement therapy, and the quit rates among patients with HMO insurance versus those with insurance other than managed care. Of 1,695 patients enrolled in the program from July 1993 to March 1996, 1,140 completed 1 year of follow-up. Of these, 348 (30.5%) reported they had quit using tobacco. Among the 810 HMO enrollees who participated in the program, the quit rate was 280 (34.6%); among the 330 non-HMO participants, the quit rate was 69 (20.9%), a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001). For all patients, keeping more than four visits with the program nurse was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of quitting (317/751 [42.2%] versus 32/389 [8.2%]; P < 0.001). Non-HMO patients were less likely than HMO enrollees to keep four or more visits (165 [50%] versus 586 [72.3%]; P < 0.001). We were unable to detect a difference in quit rates among those with and those without a pharmacy benefit (196/577 [34%] versus 84/233 [36.1%]). These data are limited by their descriptive nature and the lack of information about other factors important in determining the quit rate among program participants. Nevertheless, they suggest that HMOs can successfully sponsor nurse-led tobacco cessation programs in multiple primary care settings and achieve 1-year quit rates significantly higher than the 15% quit rate reported in the medical literature. In addition, successfully quitting tobacco use appeared to be associated with use of counseling visits but not with use of a pharmacy benefit to pay for nicotine replacement therapy. Even though tobacco cessation programs have the best chance of benefitting HMO enrollees, patients not enrolled in managed care plans also appear to benefit significantly. This finding has important implications for developing future strategies--including the role of managed care organizations, the need to defray the costs of nicotine replacement therapy, and the best approach to provide counseling to patients--to meet the Healthy People 2000 goal of reducing tobacco smoking.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Many references revealed that tobacco dust exposure induces mutations, damage to DNA etc. which are supposed to be the consequences of free radical generation. In present study attempt have been made to evaluate the status of oxidants and antioxidants and their relation with nicotine. 90 bidi workers were screened for serum lipid peroxide (MDA) and serum nitric oxide (NO*) as oxidant and erythrocytic-Superoxide Dismutase (RBC-SOD), Vitamin-C as antioxidant. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and urinary cotinine were also measured. These bidi workers were further divided in 3 groups, Group 1, 11 and III exposed to tobacco dust for about 10 to 14 yrs, 15 to 19 yrs and 20 to 24 yrs of exposure respectively. Highly significant excretion of Urinary cotinine was found in all groups of bidi workers as compared with control (p < 0.001). The levels of MDA, and NO* were found to be significantly elevated in all the three groups with progression of exposure, than the control (p < 0.001), where as the levels of RBC-SOD, Vitamin-C and TAC were significantly decreased in all the three groups as compared with controls (p < 0.001). From our findings it is evident that nicotine absorption might contribute to the disturbed oxidant and antioxidant balance leading to oxidative stress.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

RESULTS: Narghile (water pipe), bidis, kreteks and other forms of oral tobacco are traditionally used in many low-income countries, and some of these are currently spreading to the Western countries. They are all linked to negative effects similar to, and often greater than, those associated with common cigarette smoking. Various potentially reduced exposure products (PREPs), including snus, targeted at smokers aware of the health risks of regular cigarettes, have recently been developed by the tobacco industry. Their pathogenic potential varies widely and is not fully known; it is in any case greater than that of pure nicotine forms (such as medicinal nicotine). Their use as cigarette substitutes should not be considered even by inveterate smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit nicotine before further independent evaluation and control. CONCLUSIONS: There is no such thing as a safe tobacco product. Like cigarettes, alternative forms of tobacco use need regulatory measures that are adapted to local situations and supplemented by preventive measures within the World Health Organization's Framework Convention for Tobacco Control.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Part 1. Chemical composition of mainstream smoke.,"A new-technology cigarette has been developed. While the new cigarette burns some tobacco, it does not use tobacco as the fuel to sustain combustion and provide heat to the cigarette. Rather, the new cigarette primarily heats tobacco thereby reducing products of smoke formation mechanisms such as tobacco combustion, tobacco pyrolysis and pyrosynthesis. The mainstream smoke composition from a cigarette based on the new design (TOB-HT) has been characterized in comparative chemical testing with two reference cigarettes using the FTC puffing regimen. Thermal properties, UV absorption characteristics, elemental composition and materials balance studies all suggest a simplified smoke aerosol. Twenty-five smoke constituents (""target compounds"") identified by the scientific community as compounds that may contribute to the diseases statistically associated with smoking have also been measured. Mainstream smoke concentrations of most target compounds are significantly lower with the TOB-HT cigarette when compared with reference cigarettes in the ultra-light ""tar"" and light ""tar"" categories. Taken together, chemical analysis results suggest simplified TOB-HT smoke chemistry with marked reductions in specific chemicals reported to be biologically active.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,Yes,['Generic tobacco/vape industry'],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

Nicotine has been intensively studied by the tobacco industry, for instance for its addictive effect at the lowest possible rates. The addition of diammonium phosphate and urea produces an alcalinization of the pH of cigarette smoke, and promotes the absorption and the trans-membrane passage of nicotine. The taste, the smell of smoke, and the visual aspect of the pack of cigarettes are also sensory components that promote addiction. Finally, menthol, sugar, cocoa and liquorice added to cigarettes also play a role in dependence and addiction to cigarettes by, for instance, making an anesthetic effect on the airways.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Determinants of smoking are both individual and environmental. Genetics and environment influence to varying degrees all of the steps in a smoker's career. Persistence of use, degree of addiction to nicotine and difficulty in stopping are influenced by inherited traits and nicotine susceptibility, whereas the social environment and the individual's cognitions are the key factors in starting smoking and successfully stopping smoking. The tools available to tobacco control include influencing the social and cultural norms concerning tobacco; legislative and regulatory measures to protect the population and to limit tobacco industry marketing tactics, now encapsulated in the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; and programmes to enhance the chance of not starting and successfully stopping. Strategies for tobacco control must work at both societal and individual levels, and directions are being taken that include genetic, pharmacological, behavioural, socio-cultural and international approaches.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The number and the parameters of Membership Functions are used in ANFIS along with the features from wavelet energy distributionare selected using GAs, maximising the diagnosis success. GA with ANFIS (GANFIS) are trained with a subset of data with known nicotine conditions. The trained GANFIS are tested using the other set of data (testing data).

This report documents the process of developing and introducing a comprehensive tobacco control policy in one Canadian regional health authority. CONTEXT: Capital Health (CH), a health authority that has 30,000 employees and serves 1.6 million people, is responsible for 18 hospitals and primary care facilities, 33 continuing care facilities, 29 public health locations, and 9 community care facilities. CH recently determined that it needed to revise its tobacco control policy because its facilities had different directives regarding tobacco use, some of which did not reflect the best current knowledge about the health risks associated with exposure to secondhand smoke. METHODS: The new smoke-free policy needed to be developed and executed within a narrow time frame, which required careful planning as well as the support of patients and CH staff members. An essential part of the new policy was the prevention of nicotine withdrawal among people required to undergo involuntary tobacco abstinence. The plan also included an integrated screening, intervention, and referral process designed to optimize health benefits for patients and staff members who smoked, as well as for those who did not. CONSEQUENCES: CH decided to close all smoking rooms (including those in psychiatry, palliative care, geriatrics, eating disorder, and tuberculosis units), to ban smoking in outdoor areas, to stop all sales of tobacco products in CH facilities, to require smoke-free environments during home visitations, and to reject funding from the tobacco industry. INTERPRETATION: By implementing a consistent ban on indoor and outdoor smoking, CH is contributing to a comprehensive tobacco control policy that is arguably a regional health authority's most profound opportunity for health promotion.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In relying on ventilated smoking rooms, however, these organizations are failing to protect the health of their employees and clients. Increased use of risk messages regarding the harms of second- and third-hand smoke, together with enhanced nicotine replacement therapies for smokers, would rectify this disproportionate injustice. Such an approach must also recognize and counteract the efforts of the tobacco industry to block total indoor smoking bans.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

However, a further reduction of tobacco smoke ingredients by smoking modern light cigarettes (tar content below 10 mg) is questionable because of compensation of smoking behaviour by the individual smoker. A further reduction of risk to contract lung cancer by smoking light cigarettes therefore is not probable and supportive data are not available. Smoking of light cigarettes is not likely to result in a significant decrease of the risk for myocardial infarction or cardiac death as well as for chronic lung diseases. Promotion of light cigarettes by the tobacco industry is suggesting that each smoker could significantly diminish his risks just by selecting the right type of cigarettes. This is not supported by long term clinical studies. Such promotion, however, provides the smoker with further arguments to continue smoking. Ultra light cigarettes (tar content below 3 mg) could potentially diminish the risk but are hardly accepted by current smokers. Despite strong promotion and advertisement ultra light cigarettes had not been successful on the market.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

The differences in the content of nicotine, solanone, tetramethyl hexadecenol, megastigmatrienones, and other compounds, determining the specific tobacco smell, have been revealed. A microbial consortium, which is able to deodorize simulated tobacco emissions and decompose nicotine, has been formed by long-term adaptation to the VOCs of tobacco leaves in a laboratory reactor, functioning as a trickle-bed biofilter. Such a biofilter eliminates 90% of the basic toxic compound (nicotine) and odor-active compounds; the filtration efficiency does not change for tobacco brands with different VOC concentrations or in the presence of foreign substances. The main strains, isolated from the formed consortium and participating in the nicotine decomposition process, belong to the genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Rhodococcus. An examination of the biofilter trickling fluid has shown full decomposition of nicotine and odor-active VOCs. The compounds, revealed in the trickling fluid, did not have any odor and were nontoxic.

These results were used to estimate an average, steady-state concentration in a 24-hr urine sample during ad libitum smoking and to assess interindividual variability in the excretion of these metabolites. The variability in absolute amount among the nine analytes ranged from 35 to 70% for these smokers.

CURRENT SITUATION: 99% of tobacco is smoked as cigarettes. Cigarettes are highly addictive, lethal, and cannot be made safer. Since 1950 commercial cigarettes have prematurely killed over 160,000 New Zealanders. Despite causes-disease warnings on tobacco packaging (from 1987) and graphic warnings (2007), bans on tobacco advertising and promotions (1990), bans on indoor workplace smoking (1990, 2004), subsidies on medicinal nicotine (2000), and despite one-third of smokers annually making serious attempts to quit, 1 in 5 New Zealand adults smoke, 2 in 5 Māori adults smoke, and cigarette consumption per adult remains virtually unchanged since 2003. Four in 5 smokers regret they ever started. PROPOSED POLICIES: Four policies combined could make cigarette smoking less attractive and the use of nicotine-only products more attractive, with respect to relative price, availability and addictiveness. These mean increasing tax on all cigarettes equally; and a bill to strengthen the Smoke-free Environments (SFE) Act: to allot cigarette sales quotas and then gradually lower them; reduce the nicotine content of cigarettes gradually by a sinking lid or by nicotine tax; and permit the sale of satisfying non-combustible nicotine-only products for smokers. As supply reduces, prices rise, and nicotine satisfaction decreases, smokers will quit; and black market risk will be minimised. Commercial cigarettes will no longer be obtainable, and even if some smoke tobacco grown legally for their own use, or even if some is obtainable illegally, tobacco consumption will greatly reduce. CONCLUSION: The smoking of tobacco sold legally kills 5000 New Zealanders annually. The SFE Act can be amended to phase out legal sales within this decade. Intensive policy research is needed now as public interest increases. Support from the public and from legislators to promote a suitable amendment bill is now needed.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Eclipse, a product of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR), was commercialized in June of 1996. Eclipse is unlike conventional cigarettes in that, like its predecessor Premier, it is designed to heat and not burn tobacco. The purpose of Eclipse was to simplify the chemical composition and reduce the biological activity of the mainstream and sidestream smoke and to achieve a significant reduction of environmental tobacco smoke. In Eclipse, tobacco pyrolysis is reduced by a carbon fuel rod that serves as a heat source for generating an aerosol having nicotine and tobacco flavor. The carbon rod, at the tip of the cigarette, is insulated and bound with two wrapping mats of glass fibers. Recently, Eclipse has been modified to address consumer complaints of burdensome draw and off-taste. The redesigned Eclipse, which we have termed the NEW Eclipse, has an unconventional filter-appearing mouthpiece that consists of a cellulose acetate cylindrical bundle with a central hollow tunnel. In our analysis of Eclipse, glass fibers (length:width aspect ratio, > or = 3:1) were: (a) observed protruding from the tip; (b) identified on the white cigarette wrapping paper; (c) viewed on the surface of the cork-appearing tipping paper; (d) found in the pack residue; (e) discovered lying freely on the cut surface of the filter by both light and electron microscopy; (f) harvested from the filter with adhesive tape; and (g) displaced when Eclipse was smoked mechanically. In a study of Eclipse that had not been removed from carefully opened packs, we observed that > or = 95% of the filters were contaminated with glass fibers (Eclipse: Regular, n = 114/120, 95%; Milds, n = 118/120, 98%; Menthol, n = 120/120, 100%). Likewise, 99% of NEW Eclipse had glass fibers on the redesigned filter (Regular, n = 119/120). In contrast, glass fibers were never observed on the filters of conventional United States filter cigarettes that had been used as controls (n = 0/120, 0%). In a study of Eclipse (n = 60), the number of glass fibers contaminating the filter surface ranged from 5 to 55. Glass fibers as well as fiber fracture items [aspect ratio, < 3:1 (e.g., particles, fragments, bits, chips, flakes, specks, and dust)] were discovered in the pack residue. The average number of glass fibers in the residue of a pack of Eclipse was 7,548 (SE +/- 3443; range, 1,164 to 26,725 glass fibers/pack; n = 7 packs). The thin and fragile glass fibers of the insulation mats had most likely been broken and fragmented in the high-speed multiple-step Eclipse manufacturing operation. Invariably, puffing on Eclipse discharged glass fibers and glass particles from the filter into the smoker's mouth. Subsequently, the bioresistant glass fibers and microscopic glass dust are inhaled and/or ingested. Contamination of Eclipse filters with glass fibers and glass dust poses a potential and unnecessary health hazard to uninformed consumers. Eclipse is a paradigm of the health danger that may be imposed by technically complex tobacco articles and nicotine delivery devices promoted by an unregulated industry to smokers worldwide, many of whom are addicted to nicotine and who seek a less hazardous cigarette.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,
ty::harm reduction strategy in tobacco control::y::2011::fa::gorini,['PUBMED'],['21926451'],21926451,,,,2011,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,[Harm reduction strategy in tobacco control].,"Potentially reduced exposure products (PREPs), already sold in USA and in some European Countries, are low-nitrosamine cigarettes, low-nitrosamine smokeless tobacco (e.g., the Swedish Snus), cigarette-like products, and medicinal nicotine products. Even e-cigarette delivers nicotine. With the exception of snus and medicinal nicotine, studies on the health effects of PREPs have not been carried out, although some PREPs are already sold and promoted as products that effectively reduce health risks. Thus, a second disaster similar to that occurred for light cigarettes could happen in the next years. Only medicinal nicotine and snus could be valid candidates to become PREPs, even if they pose some significant health risks. The World Health Organization, following a precautionary approach, has recently published a list of 9 carcinogens or toxicants recommended for mandated lowering (the tobacco-specific nitrosamines NNN and NNK, acetaldehyde, acrolein, benzene, benzo[a]pyrene, 1-3 butadiene, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde), and 9 carcinogens or toxicants for monitoring in usual cigarettes (not PREPs), underlining that tobacco companies cannot use this reduction strategy as a promotional message, as it occurred for light cigarettes in the 70s and 80s. The present status quo, in which cigarettes are freely available, medicinal nicotine, being a drug, is available under a regulated market, and Snus is prohibited, actually denies smokers the right to choose safer nicotine products. The solution suggested by the UK Royal College of Physicians is to balance the nicotine market, framing tobacco products and medicinal nicotine in the same regulation system; establishing a nicotine and tobacco regulatory authority;making medicinal nicotine more available; evaluating the feasibility of the introduction in the English market of Swedish Snus. California Government remarks that the nicotine maintenance is not a valid strategy, because it could induce smokers not to try to quit.Thus, California Department of Health Services prohibits promotion of snus and medicinal nicotine as a harm reduction strategy. However, the US Federal Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, signed by President Obama in 2009, places tobacco products under FDA jurisdiction: FDA must define criteria for lowering carcinogens and toxicants in tobacco products, making more available medicinal nicotine, evaluating PREPs, creating a federal Tobacco Control Agency.Which approaches is Italy going to follow?","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between June 1998 and May 1999, the effects of an anti-smoking mass media campaign and alternative strategies were evaluated, by comparing the monthly sales average of all smoking-cessation aid products before and after marketing a new nicotine patch. Student's t paired and unpaired t tests were used to compare sales. RESULTS: Total sales increased from 24,206 +/- 4,558 to 55,604 +/- 8,993 (p < 0.0001). It was estimated that 1,853 smokers tried to quit and 96 per day succeeded with a single product after the campaign. Alternative strategies to get similar results indicate that the programs of a single public sector institution could help 501 persons attempt quitting smoking and six to accomplish it per day. CONCLUSIONS: The mass media have a powerful effect on smoking cessation practices; the involvement of more public institutions may accomplish similar results as the private sector.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

A society freed of its addiction to nicotine would ultimately experience a life expectancy gain comparable to that that would be achieved by the elimination of all cancers not caused by tobacco use. In particular, each year, the 390,000 individuals who now succumb to tobacco-related deaths instead would realize a life expectancy gain of 15 years. The tobacco industry implies that the demise of tobacco consumption would wreak havoc with the economy. By contrast, some antitobacco activists suggest that the end of tobacco use would yield a multibillion dollar fiscal dividend. Each argument is fundamentally flawed. The economic impacts of a nicotine-free society would be modest and of far less consequence than the principal implication: a significantly enriched quality and quantity of life.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Current e-cigarette use among adolescents has more than doubled in the past few years nationally and more than tripled in Hawai'i, despite the fact that safety in terms of health and injury from use is widely unknown. The use of e-cigarettes among adolescents is of particular concern because they may act as a gateway to smoking conventional tobacco cigarettes, substitute for cigarettes where smoking would normally not be allowed, and weaken the effect of clean air policies, and displace effective smoking cessation treatments. Additionally, the use of e-cigarettes may lead to the use of conventional cigarettes. There is special concern that e-cigarette companies are recruiting adolescents who would not have otherwise tried smoking by using tactics such as offering e-cigarettes in attractive flavorings and using the same successful strategies to market their product as tobacco companies have used for conventional cigarettes in past decades. It has been shown that exposure to cigarette marketing is related to initiation and progression in adolescent smoking. Yet, there remains no regulation on the marketing of e-cigarettes to adolescents. It can be extrapolated that expanded regulation that includes limits on the marketing of e-cigarettes may help decrease use among adolescents and prevent the possible increase of smoking rates.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Within the vascular tree, there is a regionalization of the propensity to produce aneurysms and the different locations result in different clinical processes. As the predominant risk factor for ubrenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), smoking is one of the most common manifestations of aneurysmal illness. For AAA compared to atherosclerosis, smoking is a far bigger risk factor. Along with contributing to the pathophysiology of AAA, smoking raises the likelihood that established AAA will rupture as well as its rate of expansion. The development of improved models for animals that are reliant on smoke or smoke constituents is helping to determine the mechanistic connection between AAA and smoking. According to the processes, there are long-lasting changes in the function of inflammatory and vascular smooth muscle cells. Focused on AAA, this review looks at the medical, epidemiology and mechanical evidence that links smoking to aneurysms.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

METHOD: An original analysis of the legislative options for New Zealand tobacco control. RESULTS: 'Business as usual' is most unlikely to achieve smoking prevalence that is less than 5% by 2025. Key components of a new Act would ideally include plans and targets with teeth, a focus on the industry, a focus on the product, reduction of supply, and a whole-of-society approach to promote consistency in policy implementation through: i) a public duty on government agencies to act consistently with smokefree law; ii) a general duty on those associated with the tobacco/nicotine industry in relation to tobacco control objectives; and iii) a principle requiring international treaties to be interpreted consistently with tobacco control objectives. CONCLUSION: Strategies such as those identified in this Viewpoint should be explored further as part of urgently needed planning to achieve the New Zealand Government's goal for Smokefree Aotearoa by 2025.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

These steps included efforts to control the language of scientific discourse on issues related to smoking and health, to bring all potentially damaging internal scientific documents under attorney work product and attorney-client privilege to avoid discovery, to remove ""deadwood"" documents, and to insulate B&W from knowledge of potentially damaging scientific information from other BAT companies.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

CONCLUSIONS: These documents provide our first look at the inner workings of the tobacco industry during the crucial period in which the scientific case that smoking is addictive and kills smokers solidified. The documents show a sophisticated legal and public relations strategy to avoid liability for the diseases induced by tobacco use. The documents show that lawyers steered scientists away from particular research avenues, which is inconsistent with the company's purported disbelief in the causation and addiction claims; if the company had been genuinely unconvinced by the causation and addiction hypotheses, then it should have had no concern that new research would provide ammunition for the enemy. Quite the contrary, the documents show that B&W and BAT recognized more than 30 years ago that nicotine is addictive and that tobacco smoke is ""biologically active"" (eg, carcinogenic).","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The natural experiments available to epidemiologists, however, have not shown a very positive reduction in mortality that can be attributed to the lowering of tar. Campaigns by public health bodies have sometimes appeared to be effective in persuading the tobacco industry to lower tar generally (for example, Australia), but such low tar campaigns have been used by the tobacco industry to promote smoking itself and to sell the view that the habit is not as dangerous as it was (for example, U.K.). Outside the U.S., there has been very little advertising that features tar content. Comparisons made in sophisticated countries may not be relevant to developing countries. The matter of tar delivery by Third World smoking products needs attention. There is little argument that cigarettes should be lower in tar. There is, however, argument as to whether an optimal dose of nicotine reward is needed in order to prevent the development of compensatory smoking habits. There is also argument as to how the levels of tar and other toxic constituents in cigarettes should be lowered. Legislation and taxation are probably better weapons than public health advertising campaigns.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

For smokers unable or unwilling to quit, tobacco products that reduce the adverse health effects of smoking may be an attractive option. Potentially reduced exposure products (PREPs) were developed by the tobacco industry in response to smokers' health concerns. PREPs purportedly lower the tar and/or nicotine levels of cigarettes, although the actual harm reduced remains questionable. One of the most recent additions to this product class are cigarettes that use genetically modified tobacco to reduce nicotine levels. This Issue Brief summarizes studies that investigate [1] how this product is used and [2] the messages smokers take away from product marketing.

Some of these new technologies are developed and owned by the tobacco industry, which invests massively for the research and development of these products. Because of its past scientific misconduct, the tobacco industry is ostracized. In the context of a fierce ideological debate on these new products, it is crucial that regulators and the public are provided with evidence-based guidance. Should the scientific production in this field be done with or without the tobacco industry?

METHODS: We carried out in-depth interviews with 18 retailers from a variety of store types where tobacco was sold. Stores were selected from a range of locations with varying levels of deprivation. We used thematic analysis to analyse the data. RESULTS: All but four of the retailers were ambivalent about selling tobacco, would rather not sell it, or fell back on a business imperative for justification. Only one retailer was explicitly unconcerned about selling tobacco products. Most participants had few or no concerns about the removal of point-of-sale displays. Issues which were raised were mainly practical and logistical issues with the removal of displays. Only three thought sales would definitely be reduced. The majority of the retailers were not opposed to a possible requirement that nicotine replacement therapy products be made available wherever tobacco products are sold. Ten supported a licensing or registration scheme for tobacco retailers, and only three were opposed. CONCLUSIONS: We found widespread ambivalence about selling tobacco. There was considerable support for the licensing of tobacco retailers and other potential tobacco control measures. The retailers' attitudes about potential financial costs and security issues from a tobacco display ban were at odds with the tobacco industry predictions and the views of retailers' organisations. Some retailers appear to be potential allies for tobacco control. This is in contrast to retailer organisations, which may be out of step with many of their members in their strong opposition to retail tobacco control interventions.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHOD: In this narrative review, Truth Tobacco Industry Documents were searched using names of those involved in the 1964 Surgeon General Report; key staff of the American Tobacco Company; and the terms addiction, addictive, dependence, habituation, and habit. Use of ""addiction"" to smoking was also examined in selected works from 1938 to 2013. RESULTS: Seevers had consulted for the cigarette industry and had been a long-standing advocate for judging nicotine use a drug habituation. He was primarily responsible for cigarettes being judged not addictive in 1964, over objections of other committee members. According to selection rules, he should have been ineligible for committee membership. At the time, multiple sources supported calling smoking an addiction. By the 1980s, ""nicotine dependence"" or ""addiction"" became officially accepted. CONCLUSIONS: One expert with financial and intellectual conflicts of interest delayed official judgments that nicotine was addictive. Selection rules for expert committees should be designed to minimize conflicts of interest and should be followed. Although heavy nicotine use may now be classified variously as a tobacco use disorder, addiction, or dependence, depending on the source or audience, ""drug habituation"" no longer has any currency. The terms used to communicate with the public are important in dealing with the individual and public health costs of tobacco use.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Smokers attempting to quit or reduce consumption have tried everything: ""low"" or ""light"" cigarettes; nicotine-infused chewing gum, lozenges, and lollipops; dermal patches; and even hypnosis. The latest craze in the quest to find a safer source of nicotine is the electronic cigarette. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have swept the market, reaching a rapidly expanding international consumer base. Boasting nicotine delivery and the tactile feel of a traditional cigarette without the dozens of other chemical constituents that contribute to carcinogenicity, e-cigarettes are often portrayed as less risky, as a smoking reduction or even a complete smoking cessation product, and perhaps most troubling for its appeal to youth, as a flavorful, trendy, and convenient accessory. The sensationalism associated with e-cigarettes has spurred outcry from health and medical professional groups, as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), because of the unknown effects on public health. Inhabiting a realm of products deemed ""tobacco products"" under recent 2009 legislation, e-cigarettes pose new challenges to FDA regulation because of their novel method of nicotine delivery, various mechanical and electrical parts, and nearly nonexistent safety data. Consumer use, marketing and promotional claims, and technological characteristics of e-cigarettes have also raised decades old questions of when the FDA can assert authority over products as drugs or medical devices. Recent case law restricting FDA enforcement efforts against e-cigarettes further confounds the distinction among drugs and medical devices, emerging e-cigarette products, and traditional tobacco products such as cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco. This Article investigates the e-cigarette phenomenon in the wake of the recently enacted Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (TCA). It examines the tumultuous history of attempts at tobacco regulation by reflecting on the history of Congressional activity to regulate tobacco sales and promotion. Furthermore, this Article suggests a feasible approach to strengthening regulation of e-cigarettes under the existing statutory framework. This approach includes increased scrutiny of manufacturer and distributor claims that trigger drug and medical device provisions, utilization of new tobacco product and modified risk tobacco product provisions, and promulgation of new FDA regulations and guidance specifically directed at e-cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

With the launch of the National Smoking Control Programme (NSCP) in 1986, a National Smoking Control Coordinating Committee was set up to look into legislation and fiscal measures. To further increase the dimension and impact of the programme, a Civic Committee on Smoking Control was formed in 1996. This committee also looks into and recommends legislative measures. The NSCP is an ongoing programme that aims to reduce smoking rates through a combination of strategies, including education, establishment of no-smoking areas and increasing taxation and legislative measures. Existing legislation is regularly and systematically reviewed and revised, and new laws are recommended to strengthen our smoking control efforts. Concurrently, penalties and ways to improve enforcement of the legislation are also updated. The legislative measures that have been implemented in Singapore over the years include prohibition of tobacco advertising and promotion, restrictions on the sale of tobacco products, licensing of sales outlets, use of health warnings on cigarette packets, controlling and labelling of tar and nicotine contents, restriction of smoking in public places and prohibition of smoking in public by the under-eighteens. Several factors have helped make legislative measures work in Singapore. These include political will and support, starting legislation early, comprehensive legislative measures, enforcement measures and continuous review. To sustain these efforts, Singapore needs to continue to stay abreast of world-wide measures on smoking control.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In addition, owing to the tricky image strategy by a tobacco company, the citizens in Japan have not become sufficiently aware of hazards of tobacco. For health hazards of smoking, people do not fully understand cigarette smoking may affect the whole body because of the strong impression of ""cancer"" particularly ""lung cancer"" as the disease of smoking. Therefore, we, healthcare professionals, should treat diseases with accurate knowledge of tobacco hazards and also should play a positive role to enlighten people about the truth of tobacco hazards, which do not mean cancer alone.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

METHOD: A telephone survey of 250 individuals randomly selected from the Christchurch Electoral Roll and assigned into one of three groups: current, ex and life-time never smokers. RESULTS: Significantly more current than ex-smokers cited habit as a major reason for continuing to smoke and a greater number reported using nicotine transdermal patches during a cessation attempt. Fewer ever smokers than never smokers stated health as a likely major motivation for cessation by smokers and believed doctors' advice and illness of a significant other highly influenced quit attempts. 55.7% of respondents believed nicotine patches to be the most effective smoking cessation method followed by 'cold turkey' (49.4%) and hypnotherapy (33.9%). While the majority of participants supported banning tobacco advertising (69.6%), banning tobacco sponsorship (59.6%), lower insurance rates for non-smokers (89.1%) and fully subsidised smoking cessation programmes (71.9%), significant differences were detected between groups regarding attitudes to tobacco control initiatives. CONCLUSIONS: This sample were relatively ill informed regarding smoking practices in New Zealand and unaware of useful information to aid cessation. While evidence emerged to support current smokers being slightly better informed regarding proven strategies for cessation than ex-smokers, few current smokers were aware of efficacious interventions for smoking cessation.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Moreover, with an estimated increase of about 5 percent a year, it now represents the first cause of mortality for cancer in both sexes. The evidence of a close relationship between lung cancer and cigarette smoking was first pointed out by E. Graham in 1950. Since then, the responsibility of active cigarette smoking in determining lung cancer as well as that of nicotine causing addictiveness, have been assessed clearly. Nevertheless primary prevention, mainly through the campaign against cigarette smoking, has always faced great difficulties because it clashes with the economic power and interests of tobacco companies. Moreover the epidemiologic trends show a progressive increase of the disease with a silent epidemic-like worldwide diffusion, in close similarity to AIDS. So, more than 5 million new cases a year of lung cancer are expected to appear at the beginning of 2000. The primary prevention against the major factor of risk-the cigarette-is mainly based, in developed countries, through the following official measures: i) a heavy taxation on the finished goods; ii) the conversion of the tobacco growing to other crops and iii) the package-based health information for all tobacco products. On the other side, while waiting for new effective chemoprevention methods, the need of getting a true early clinical diagnosis of tumor is emphasised. Only by this means is it indeed possible to improve the rate of cure through performing conventional resections of those cancers which could be discovered in still limited clinical stage. In the same time, a strong effort for radically operating Stage III locally advanced cancers, is also attempted through the newer tracheobronchoplastic procedures as well as the other over extended resections done directly in the mediastinal area. The neoadjuvant radio and/or chemotherapy combined treatments preceding surgery are also of great clinical interest. Finally the active palliative support aimed at improving the quality of life in patients affected by incurable tumors, represents a fast developing clinical project where a great ethical meaning is pre-eminent above all.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

We therefore examined the place of regulatory frameworks in advancing tobacco control, and suggest the formation of a Government Tobacco Authority. Such an authority could enable the Government to specify the design of tobacco products (to maximise harm reduction), to eliminate the marketing for profit of branded products, and to appropriately control the introduction of alternative nicotine delivery devices or less hazardous alternative tobacco products. As the authority could be funded through levies on the tobacco industry, it has the potential advantage of delivering major population health gains while costing the taxpayer nothing.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

But, as far as health is concerned, cigarette is the worst nicotine delivery system and cleaner delivery systems would be welcome. In respect to tobacco smoking, up to now, most doctors have supported the ""quit smoking or die"" dogma. However, some smokers cannot or do not want to completely give up the consumption of nicotine. BACKGROUND: Indeed, while some smokers can stop smoking and, for some of them, simply switch to a nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), other smokers crave the acute effects associated with the rapid massive surge of nicotine delivered to the brain by tobacco smoke. Currently, this rapid nicotine ""high"" is mainly experienced by smoking cigarettes, thus explaining the high rate of smoking relapse. VIEWPOINT: Thus, for smokers who cannot totally give up nicotine, it is sound to evaluate the rationale for the use of tobacco products with possible lower toxicity than cigarette smoke. CONCLUSIONS: Unfortunately, this important question triggers off passionate statements, while scientific and experimental observations are still very tenuous. Furthermore, the tobacco companies, by producing new tobacco products and promoting the use of smokeless tobacco such as snus, put a constant pressure on the Public Health community.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Nicotine is widely regarded as responsible for this dependence process. It stimulates ubiquitous cholinergic receptors thus resulting mainly in catecholamine release. The causal role of nicotine in inducing and maintaining tobacco dependence is not so obvious as that of drugs responsible for other addictions. Animal models that have been described are not convincing. Smokers tend to change their smoking patterns so as to keep blood nicotine levels constant when nicotine yields of cigarettes are manipulated. This ""nicotine titration phenomenon"" is a strong argument in favor of them craving for nicotine. However, other components, such as tar, vary correlatively. Nicotine gum helps to quit smoking, but few people become gum-addicted. A better knowledge of the tobacco components that may induce dependence is needed to understand its neurochemical mechanisms and to provide the tobacco industry with adequate information for manufacturing less hazardous products.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

These processes may lead to adverse health effects caused by dermal absorption of nicotine such as Green Tobacco Sickness (GTS). OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between GTS resulting from dry Thai traditional tobacco production and salivary cotinine levels among Thai traditional tobacco farmers in Nan Province, Thailand. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted with 20 tobacco farmers and 20 non-tobacco farmers in Praputtabath Sub-District and Phatow Sub-District. The participants were randomly selected and interviewed using in person questionnaires with bi-weekly follow-up for 14 weeks. During each contact, the cotinine concentration was measured by NicAlert(TM) Saliva strip tests (NCTS). Descriptive statistics and Spearman's correlation (Spearman's rho) was used to examine the relationship between the variables at both 0.01 and 0.05 significant probability levels. RESULTS: This study indicated that GTS from dry tobacco production has the potential to be considered a common occupational disease. This study demonstrated the usefulness of salivary cotinine level measurements by NCTS. The levels were well correlated with farmers who were employed in the dry Thai tobacco production industry. Salivary cotinine levels were also significantly correlated with the prevalence of GTS in the group of tobacco farmers at any given time within a crop season. However, the production process of dry Thai traditional tobacco is different from that evaluated in our previous studies where GTS and salivary cotinine level were correlated in workers working in humid conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term effects of such exposure should be investigated and health education programs with health risk exposure studies to increase awareness amongst farmers is recommended.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: This paper as a systematic review and documents through Pubmed and webs seeks to understand the politician economy implications of nicotine addiction in Iran, focusing on the US office of foreign asset control's (OFAC) awarding of Iran operations licenses to American tobacco companies. RESULTS: By comparing Iran's tobacco industry and the attendant public health crisis that has arisen from high rates of nicotine addiction, to conditions in Turkey, it can be demonstrated that Iran is uniquely unable to extract revenues from the sale of tobacco products. The primary point of comparison between Iran and Turkey is smoking-attributable annual productivity loses of each country as estimated through the use of smoking-attributable mortality, morbidity and economic costs software (SAMMEC) and the available related literature. Based on the calculations derived from the SAMMEC model, Iran is burdened with an incredible cost to the economy borne by a high prevalence of smokers. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that an awareness of this condition enables OFAC to award licenses to big tobacco without fear of undermining current foreign policy initiatives.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

METHOD: Emissions of Mild Seven charcoal filter brands, regular (labelled '12 mg tar') and Light (labelled '9 mg tar') purchased in 2004, were compared with those of Holiday Extra-mild brand (9 mg tar, acetate filter), purchased in 2002. All emissions were tested under intensive machine smoking conditions by Labstat International Inc., Kitchener, Ontario. RESULTS: The Mild Seven brands contained a small amount of charcoal, its black granules visible against the white acetate filter. The charcoal filter in the brands tested did not reduce toxicity to the extent expected, though they gave significantly lower emissions for the respiratory-toxicants acrolein (14%-17% lower, p 'less than and equal to' 0.01) and formaldehyde (26-37% lower, p 'less than and equal to' 0.01). Reductions were not significant for acetaldehyde, and actually higher for hydrogen cyanide. Overall, estimated cardiovascular-respiratory toxicity was not reduced, whether based on toxicant emissions or the toxicant to nicotine ratios. Of the packet labels, neither tar yield (mg) nor the descriptors 'mild', 'light', or 'extra-mild', or 'charcoal filter' for these three brands was associated with any reduction of the combined respiratory--and cardiovascular toxicity of mainstream smoke, as measured by leading toxicants tested by the intensive method. Previously secret documents from cigarette companies, including British American Tobacco, reported reductions of 75%-80% in hydrogen cyanide, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and formaldehyde in mainstream smoke from addition of charcoal to the filter. We estimated that an effective charcoal filter could reduce a brand's overall relative toxicity score for identifiable toxicant by over 40%. CONCLUSION: Since 1965, major cigarette firms have known from their chemists that many smoke toxicants, including hydrogen cyanide and acrolein, were removable by manufacturing the cigarette with a charcoal filter. To this day, few brands have charcoal filters. The best known, Mild Seven, contained a token charcoal filter only. In neither Japan nor New Zealand did this brand lower cardiovascular toxicant emissions in smoke. In the Smoke-free Environments Act, Government has the power to lower smoke emissions by regulation, but no regulations are in place. The Act does not give power to add filters to cigarettes, but does give power to lower smoke emissions to the level attainable by using a charcoal filter, which could reduce smoke emission toxicity to a large extent. Regulation to require effective charcoal filters is now long overdue.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

ST ingestion causes addiction and serious health consequences, including various forms of cancer and significant dental diseases. It is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. Nicotine levels in ST are very high, and ST intake is rapidly addicting. Tobacco companies have been accused of ""graduating"" youthful customers from flavored lower-nicotine ""starter"" products to forms that contain a more highly concentrated nicotine content. Clinicians should routinely ask children, teens and adults about ST use. Early intervention in youth who are experimenting with ST or using ""starter"" products may prevent addiction and disease.

The venue of the meeting was Venice, in the old Monastery of the Isola San Giorgio, and it was jointly organised by the Italian Association of Hospital Pulmonologists (AIPO) and the European Section of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT--Europe). The meeting was also sponsored by the European Respiratory Society (ERS). The importance of the topic cannot be underestimated. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) tobacco smoking is the most important cause of preventable death in the industrialised world. When tobacco smoking constitutes a repetitive and compulsive behaviour, for instance when a person continues smoking when suffering from a smoking related disease, it is due to tobacco dependence, which both WHO and the American Psychiatric Association classify as a disease. Tobacco smoking is not only a disease in itself but can also cause other diseases, such as chronic obstructive lung disease, lung cancer and cardiovascular disease, and can worsen pre-existent disease, e.g. asthma. In the WHO European region, according to WHO estimates, tobacco smoking causes at least 1,200,000 deaths each year (14% of all deaths). So far, a preventive strategy based on protection of children and adolescents from initiation has not worked in decreasing the prevalence among young generations. Even with the best educational programs success is partial and ephemeral. Smoking cessation with behavioural and pharmacological aid is a well established therapeutic intervention, supported by strong scientific evidence. But smoking cessation can also be a preventive intervention, because it can reduce the prevalence of smokers in a community. Obviously, smoking cessation is to be used together with all other interventions recognized as effective in tobacco control (cigarette and tobacco product pricing, regulatory approaches, smoking bans, health education).","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

And the next generation needs policies that will better protect them from becoming smokers. Low-nitrosamine tobacco snuff (hereafter termed 'snuff') is 20 times less dangerous than cigarette smoking. Its sale as nasal snuff raises the question as to how long cigarettes, including cigars and pipe tobacco, should continue to be sold and allowed to hasten the deaths of 4000 New Zealanders annually. Oral snuff has helped to reduce smoking to unusually low levels in Swedish men, is much less dangerous than smoking, and does not cause lung or mouth cancer. Moreover, smokeless tobacco (which includes snuff) could reduce smoking-caused health inequity for Maori. Snuff can improve population health, and more so if more smokers switch to it. Continued bans on snuff are now regarded by some experts as unsound public policy. Added to the mountain of evidence against cigarettes, sufficient evidence now exists for Government to use snuff to create safer tobacco choices for smokers, end cigarette sales altogether, and thus end the cigarette smoking deaths epidemic--in which 200,000 New Zealanders have died so far. The New Zealand Government can: Fund media campaigns to inform smokers of their new choices, and to urge them to quit smoking. (The 2007 Budget commits an extra $11 million per year for 4 years, an excellent start.) Regulate for warnings on snuff cans stating that snuff is ""addictive but much safer than smoking"", and regulate imports to only permit reduced-risk low-nitrosamine products. Tax each class of tobacco products proportionate to the respective risks of each. (Tax cigarettes at 20 times the snuff rate, instead of at the same rate.) Legislate, to expand the Smoke-free Environments Act's aims to include ending the sale of cigarettes and ending smoking deaths--i.e: Allow oral snuff to compete with cigarettes for market share (and for the smoker's nicotine receptors). Reduce addiction to smoking, by decreasing the nicotine content of cigarettes by 5% every 6 months. (Below 20% of current levels, most smokers will quit or switch to snuff.), Allot cigarette supply quotas to manufacturers and importers, decreasing by 5% every 6 months, on the grounds that cigarette smoke is irremediably toxic. The summed effects of these changes could end cigarette sales within 10 years, and prevent 90% of cigarette deaths within 22 years thereafter.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

The cumulative odds logistic regression analysis showed that males with lower education level (OR=1.968, P=0.040), with higher income level (OR=2.053, P=0.043), leaving shorter butts (OR=2.366, P=0.010) and with high nicotine dependence (OR=7.143, P<0.001) had more cigarette smoking. CONCLUSION: Smokers who changed the brand of cigarette were more likely to choose low tar cigarette. Smokers with low education level, high income level and high nicotine dependence are the target population for health education and behavior intervention in smoking control.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

ty::taking behavioralism seriously some evidence of market manipulation::y::1999::fa::hanson,['PUBMED'],['10558427'],10558427,,,,1999,Harvard law review,Taking behavioralism seriously: some evidence of market manipulation.,"Over the last ten to fifteen years, economists and legal scholars have become increasingly interested in and sensitive to behavioralist insights. In a companion article, Jon Hanson and Douglas Kysar argued that those scholars have nevertheless given short shrift to what is, at least for policymaking purposes, perhaps the most important lesson of the behavioralist research: individuals' perceptions and preferences are highly manipulable. According to Hanson and Kysar, one theoretical implication of that insight for products liability law is that manufacturers and marketers will manipulate the risk perceptions of consumers. Indeed, to survive in a competitive market, manufacturers and marketers must do so. In this Article, Hanson and Kysar present empirical evidence of market manipulation--a previously unrecognized source of market failure. The Article begins by surveying the extensive qualitative and quantitative marketing research and consumer behavioral studies that discern and influence consumer perceptions. It then provides evidence of market manipulation by reviewing common practices in everyday market settings, such as gas stations and supermarkets, and by examining familiar marketing approaches, such as environmentally oriented and fear-based advertising. Although consumers may be well-aware of those practices and approaches, they appear to be generally unaware of the extent to which those tactics are manipulative. The Article then focuses on the industry that has most depended upon market manipulation: the cigarette industry. Through decades of sophisticated marketing and public relations efforts, cigarette manufacturers have heightened consumer demand and lowered consumer risk perceptions. Because consumers are aware that smoking may pose significant health risks, the tobacco industry's success in manipulating risk perceptions constitutes especially strong evidence of the power of market manipulation. The Article concludes by arguing that the evidence of market manipulation may justify moving to a regime of enterprise liability. Indeed, according to Hanson and Kysar, the evidence of market manipulation confirms the intuitions of the first generation of product liability scholars, who worried about manufacturers' power to manipulate and called for just such a regime.",['Tobacco/Combustibles'],Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

In the vanguard are tobacco industry devices that heat tobacco derivatives rather than burn tobacco, and pharmaceutical industry nicotine-replacement products, with nicotine gum and the patch now available over the counter. Ostensibly, these 2 industries have diametrically opposed objectives, the tobacco industry striving to sustain nicotine addictions, the pharmaceutical industry to end them. However, a series of technological, economic, political, regulatory, and social developments augurs a strange-bedfellows competition in which these industries will vie for shares of a new multibillion dollar long-term nicotine-maintenance market. Regulatory options range from encouraging competition to banning all nicotine-delivery devices. A more realistic approach discourages use of the most dangerous products, while making less hazardous products readily available to adults.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Under this Act, a product is a ""drug"" or ""device"" subject to FDA jurisdiction if it is ""intended to affect the structure or any function of the body."" The FDA determined that nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco does ""affect the structure or any function of the body"" because nicotine causes addiction and other pharmacological effects. The FDA then determined that these pharmacological effects are ""intended"" because (1) a scientific consensus has emerged that nicotine is addictive; (2) recent studies have shown that most consumers use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco for pharmacological purposes, including satisfying their addiction to nicotine; and (3) newly disclosed evidence from the tobacco manufacturers has revealed that the manufacturers know that nicotine causes pharmacological effects, including addiction, and design their products to provide pharmacologically active doses of nicotine. The FDA thus concluded that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are subject to FDA jurisdiction because they contain a ""drug,"" nicotine, and a ""device"" for delivering this drug to the body.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

Fifty five percent of the French population smoke at age 18. To decrease the tobacco consumption is thus a paramount public health objective. Following WHO and ""Europe Against Cancer"", a comprehensive program against smoking should ban advertising, increase prices, protect non-smokers, educate children, promote non-smoking behaviors and help smokers who want to stop. The measures taken in France, following the law of January 10th, 1991, made possible a 11.1% decrease of tobacco consumption and a 14.5% decrease of cigarette consumption. If France is exemplary for the ban of tobacco advertising, the means devoted to education and information are poor, the weakest in Europe. So, it is still possible to speed up the decrease of tobacco consumption in France so that the estimate of 165,000 deaths related to tobacco consumption in 2025 will not occur. This success has to be interpreted within a European and Worldwide context. The tobacco industry is responsible for denying the danger of tobacco, the addictive effect and nicotine and for targeting children and adolescents. Faced to the forecast of 100 million deaths within twenty years, only an international solution can be of the right size.

Partly due to the massive and uninhibited advertising of the tobacco companies smoking prevalence has dramatically increased until the mid-sixties. Since then thousands of reports on the damaging-effects of smoking have been published which has led to a change in attitude and to a decrease in smoking prevalence at least in industrialised countries. In Switzerland about 25% of the adult population smoke, but the percentage in the age group between 25 to 34 years is significantly higher. Smoking is the most important preventable cause of disease; this has been underlined by recent findings that about 50% of smokers will eventually die from their habit. Regular smokers-usually defined as regularly smoking more than 10-15 cigarettes daily-are nicotine dependent and do not smoke because they want to, but because they have to. Although 60-70% of smokers would like to quit, they fail without help. Nevertheless, smoking cessation is possible: the most important issue is the smoker's own motivation. Psychological counselling and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) given as either patch, chewing gum, or nasal spray are merely aids to enhance success. With intensive counselling and NRT a maximum success rate of about 30% can be expected assessed 1 year after quit date. In general the use of NRT doubles the success rate of any chosen form of intervention. Cessation of smoking in young people is currently considered the best form of prevention.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

Smoking-related disorders have been known for decades and adverse effects of cigarette smoking are well documented. Nevertheless, tobacco use has increased dramatically in our century to become a global pandemic. Tobacco advertising attracts teenagers and encourages them to experiment with an addictive drug. To decrease uptake of smoking by adolescents, tobacco opponents propose advertising bans. They demand better protection for both active and passive smokers. These demands are in obvious contrast to the interests of the tobacco companies. Restriction of tobacco production and marketing could result in a substantial decrease in profits for tobacco manufacturers. Therefore, bills or regulations to control nicotine products are resisted by a strong tobacco lobby, especially in the USA. This article explains the marketing strategies of the tobacco industry and cost calculations of smoking.

In the meantime, research confirms that nicotine is highly addictive, that smoking just a cigarette a day is highly detrimental for health, and that health professionals are efficient in helping smokers to give up. These measures are such diverse as tobacco taxes increases, introducing plain packs, promoting November as month without tobacco, getting tobacco cessation medications paid for by health insurances, implementing a comprehensive advertising ban of tobacco products in retailor shops, and increasing protection of public health policies from tobacco industry intrusion. This industry via frenzied marketing reacts by promoting ""heat not burn tobacco"" as a harm reduction mean, which it is not, and invests in e-cigarettes, whose most recent ones are as addictive as classic tobacco cigarettes.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,Yes,

Research continues to enlarge the spectrum of diseases caused by tobacco use among users as well as among nonusers exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke. This review attempts to illustrate the greater risk to adverse health outcomes among the less educated due to a greater prevalence of tobacco use among them. Numerous surveys worldwide and in India show a greater prevalence of tobacco use among the less educated and illiterate. In a large population based study in Mumbai, the odds ratios for any kind of tobacco use among the illiterate as compared to the college educated were 7.4 for males and 20.3 for females after adjusting for age and occupation. School-dropouts are more likely to take up tobacco use in childhood and adolescence. Student youth taught about the dangers of tobacco use in school are less likely to initiate tobacco use. High tobacco use among the less educated and under privileged affects them in multiple ways: (i) Tobacco users in such households, because of their nicotine addiction, prefer spending a disproportionate amount of their meager income on tobacco products, often curtailing essential expenditures for food, healthcare and education for the family. (ii) Because of high tobacco use and other factors of disadvantage connected with low educational status, they suffer more from the diseases and other health impacts caused by tobacco. This higher morbidity results in high health care expenditures, which impoverish the family further. (iii) Premature death caused by tobacco use in this under- privileged section often takes away the major wage earner in the family, plunging it into even more hardship. Tobacco use is a terrible scourge particularly of the less educated, globally and in India. Tobacco use, education and health in a human population are inter-related in ways that make sufferings and deaths caused by tobacco use even more tragic than normally realized. Tobacco use works against social and economic development and should be appropriately addressed through health education and tobacco cessation services particularly in the underprivileged, illiterate population.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Positive,No,

In 1970, Common Market Organisation provided a virtually unlimited support for European tobacco production. After 2004, funds progressively has been cut by half, even though the other half has been given for restructuring or reconversion of tobacco farms through the Rural Development Plan. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control recommends conversion of tobacco crops, although there are no effective measures. Tobacco production requires large quantities of chemicals (pesticides, growth regulators, fertilisers), with significant workers' exposure if applied without personal protective equipments. Pesticides may have genotoxic, teratogenic, immunotoxic, hormonal, and carcinogenic effects. Tobacco itself may cause also a disease called ""Green tobacco sickness"" syndrome, as a consequence of nicotine dermal absorption due to skin exposure to tobacco leaves. In Italy, financial resources for tobacco production and restructuring/conversion to other crops of previously tobacco planted fields are available.

To survive, the four transnational companies that control the market must adapt their strategy, which they do by shifting from the tobacco trade to the wider nicotine trade through the promotion of new products (electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products). However, two intangible but well-established facts remain: the initiation to tobacco/nicotine consumption occurs almost exclusively during childhood; on the other hand and that age group is very sensitive to marketing and purchasing impulses. Therefore, the industrials must target young people and ease their access to their products. Once the initial nicotine intake has been established, the drug takes over and enforces continuous consumption due to its highly addictive nature. Nonetheless, as explicit targeting of the youth is not a socially acceptable practice, the industry will conceal its strategy behind the façade of promoting harm reduction for adult smokers who wish to do this. Although communication channels are recent, such as the Internet, social media, platforms and more generally, what is commonly accepted as « communication below the line », the methods that aim at reinforcing established nicotine consumption as a social norm are of the same nature as those previously used for the promotion of cigarettes: glamour, seduction, youth, motorsports, tech, adventure, independence, maturity. Unfortunately, the rate of smoking among young people in France remains high due to the effectiveness of this marketing, combined with the easy accessibility to the product, due to non-compliance by tobacco sellers with the current legislation prohibiting sales to minors.""","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Yes,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,Yes,

The tobacco histories of these two countries, which provide the background to this difference, are herein compared. The antismoking movement is becoming more vociferous in both countries. Publicity regarding of the dangers of smoking, warning signs on tobacco packages, the introduction of antismoking devices, a ban on commercials for tobacco-related products on TV and the radio, no-smoking seats on airplanes, and litigation against the tobacco industry have all been introduced. However, major differences remain between these two countries. The tobacco industry in the USA has been a private company since it was first established. Courts have ordered the tobacco industry to pay compensation for damage to health resulting from tobacco. Smoking is strictly restricted inside buildings. Advertisements for nicotine gum and nicotine patches and reports on the dangers of smoking are regularly broadcast. In the case of Japan, the government at first nationalized the tobacco industry, and then made it a private company, although the government still holds two-thirds of its stock. Moreover, it established the Tobacco Business Law to support the company. The main purpose of antismoking campaigns in Japan is a partial ban on smoking. On the basis of these differences between the two countries regarding the history of tobacco, the antismoking movement in Japan has yet to choose which path to take.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

Tobacco addiction is presently considered as the central element in smoking. The mechanisms of action of drugs of abuse (including nicotine) and the current techniques for their study in animals and in humans are briefly reviewed. Cigarettes are manipulated by the tobacco industry to increase the level of dependence. The transnational tobacco companies use a global tactic to expand their sales, particularly in the third world, so that the mean world cigarette consumption per adult remains unchanged at approximately 1500 per year. Nevertheless, it is hoped that control of the epidemic will be gained in the 21st century, since the awareness of tobacco risks and costs is increasing, an antismoking climate is developing and the tobacco lobby has lost its credibility. On the other hand, improved behavioural and pharmacological methods increase the cessation rate. Health professionals are progressively more involved in the smoking cessation problems, while international control measures are applied by the European Commission. The World Health Organization is preparing a ""Framework Convention on Tobacco Control"" with binding mechanisms for governments. A larger involvement of the community is needed to promote an international policy based on health values, rather than on trade considerations, and addressing the specific problems of the third world. Nevertheless, since a latency of approximately 30 yrs exists between the increase in tobacco consumption in a population and the rise in tobacco mortality, past trends in consumption will continue to influence health status during the next 30 yrs. Present, urgently needed, radical health measures are expected to have their major impact only after that period.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

METHODS: Nationwide cross-sectional surveys of fourth-form students in New Zealand in 85 schools by anonymous self-administered questionnaire in 1992 and 1997. In 1992, 79% of schools and 70% of students responded; in 1997, 88% and 72%, respectively. RESULTS: Responses were analysed from 11,824 14- and 15 year-old fourth formers in 1992 and from 11,350 in 1997. Daily, weekly or monthly combined smoking prevalence increased by 27% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21-32), adjusting for age, sex and ethnicity, from 23.4% in 1992 to 28.5% in 1997. Daily smoking increased from 11.6% in 1992 to 15.5% in 1997 - an adjusted 37% (95% CI = 24-47) increase. The increase in daily smoking was: greater in girls (44%, 95% CI = 33-57) than boys (28%, 95% CI = 16-42), adjusting for age and ethnicity; unrelated to the socioeconomic decile of schools; and greatest in Auckland and Northland. CONCLUSION: This increase in smoking is large, 27-37% over five years, of uncertain cause, affects both sexes, all regions, ethnic and socio-economic groups, and certain cigarette brands. Regular school smoking surveys and more smokefree youth venues are recommended. Addiction and nicotine absorption merit monitoring. Legislation can require disclosure of manufacturing recipes used for youth-popular cigarette brands. On 1960-97 trends it would take 100 years to reduce fourth-form smoking to 5% prevalence. The proposed gradual denicotinisation of all cigarettes would allow smoking but prevent addiction, within ten years.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

The mean geometric concentration of urinary nicotine of shredding workers and packing workers at the end of shift was 44.8 +/- 5.1 ng/ml and 9.9 +/- 5.4 ng/ml, and was significantly higher than that of the controls (1.0 +/- 1.0 ng/ml) (P < 0.01). The concentration of urinary nicotine of shredding workers was significantly higher at the end of shift than pre-exposure period (11.46 +/- 6.73 ng/ml). The intervention test for the absorption of nicotine showed that there were good protection effects for the absorption of nicotine when glove and mask were used simultaneously and ventilator was used in summer.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,
ty::what does harm reduction in tobacco use means to public health::y::2024::fa::ayesta,['PUBMED'],['38804329'],38804329,PMC11575274,,,2024,Revista espanola de salud publica,[What does Harm Reduction in Tobacco Use means to Public Health].,"Harm reduction is a classic Public Health concept to refer to the reduction of the negative effect of drug use/abuse with a focus on justice and human rights, but the tobacco industry has been perverting this concept for years and using it as a tool for its own marketing. This publication details what real harm reduction action on tobacco use would be, when it should be implemented, and what pillars it should be based on. Different methods of reducing the harmful effects of tobacco and nicotine have been tried and tested over time, but the results have been poor; therefore, smoking cessation by the various officially recognised methods is recommended as a priority objective, using the tools that are truly supported by science. In contrast, it also explains the strategies developed by the industry to manipulate consumers and make them dependent on products that can eventually kill them: from the development of filtered cigarettes to light cigarettes, and from menthol to flavoured vapes. In all cases, they have falsely led people to believe that they were developing less toxic products when they were not. Nowadays, both light and menthol cigarettes are banned in Spain, filters have not reduced risk but increased the use, and vapes try to replace cigarettes with their attractive flavours and their false legend of healthier products when what they are really doing is maintaining the same addiction by changing the object, encouraging dual use, and attracting younger and younger non-smokers. At the same time, a strategy of dividing the opinion of health professionals has been developed, using medical doctors and researchers with recognised conflicts of interest but who manage to confuse consumers. In conclusion, we consider that, although nicotine releasing devices may be useful elements in some particular cases, they are not recommended at the population level as they can promote onset, prevent cessation, as well as maintaining the addictive capacity. The only nicotine products that are recommended are those of pharmacological use approved for the case and provided they are used as a transitional tool to complete cessation.","['E-cigarettes/ENDS', 'Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",No,No,[],None/Not stated,Mixed,No,

Two elements absolutely critical to any plan are the elimination of tobacco advertising and promotion and the removal of addiction as a reason for tobacco use. Minimal components of any settlement should include: (a) acceptance by the tobacco manufacturers of the causal relationship between tobacco use and disease, and the addictive nature of nicotine; (b) a total ban on tobacco advertising and promotion; (c) FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products and their nicotine content, with the intent of removing nicotine as soon as acceptable nicotine substitution products are available; (d) reimbursement to the states for Medicaid and other state expenditures attributable to smoking, to the maximum extent feasible; (e) funding for local, state, and federal programmes and research in tobacco control; (f) acceptance of legislation and regulations protecting the right of non-smokers to breathe air free of tobacco smoke; (g) funding for a large, national, media-led, anti-tobacco campaign; and (h) cessation assistance for addicted smokers. If negotiations toward a settlement proceed, it is essential that the public health community participate in defining the elements of any agreement to ensure that whatever agreement develops is focused on reducing tobacco-related disease rather than continuing the profitability of American tobacco companies. That participation requires articulation of the core elements essential to an acceptable agreement. If resolution of the public health issues surrounding continued sale of tobacco products can be reached in the United States, it may provide a model for similar resolution in other countries.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,
ty::who profits from tobacco sales to children::y::1990::fa::difranza,['PUBMED'],['2332922'],2332922,,,,1990,JAMA,Who profits from tobacco sales to children?,"It is estimated that more than 3 million American children under 18 years of age consume 947 million packs of cigarettes and 26 million containers of smokeless tobacco yearly. These tobacco products account for annual sales of $1.26 billion. Approximately 3% of tobacco industry profits ($221 million in 1988) derive directly from the sale of cigarettes to children, an activity that is illegal in 43 states. Approximately half of the tobacco industry's profits, or $3.35 billion annually, derives from sales to people who became addicted to nicotine as children. Tax revenues to the federal ($152 million) and state ($173 million) governments from cigarette sales to children dwarf governmental expenditures on smoking and health. We describe how dozens of communities have effectively enforced laws that prohibit the distribution of tobacco to children and offer some suggestions for increasing efforts to prevent nicotine addiction.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Negative,No,

It seeks to explain why funding which was once acceptable is now unacceptable. The hypotheses advanced include: the changing nature of the industry's interest in research and the role of marketing; the rise of the 'new public health' alliance focused on abstention rather than on harm minimization; the role of government funding and control of research; and the changing meaning of tobacco and especially nicotine.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,

ty::youth and tobacco::y::2004::fa::tanski,['PUBMED'],['15765019'],15765019,,,,2004,Minerva pediatrica,Youth and tobacco.,"Youth around the world take up smoking and use tobacco products at high rates. Young people may not grasp the long-term consequences of tobacco use, although tobacco consumption and exposure has been shown to have significant negative health effects. Youth use a variety of tobacco products that are smoked, chewed, or sniffed, including machine-manufactured cigarettes, cigars, bidis, kreteks, sticks, and snuff. Prevention efforts have focused on countering those aspects that are believed to contribute to smoking uptake, such as tobacco industry advertising and promotion, and access to tobacco. There are many aspects of tobacco promotion through the media that have been more difficult to control, however, such as product placement within popular cinema movies. Once a youth has taken up tobacco, he or she is more likely than an adult to become addicted and should be offered treatment for tobacco cessation. Although there is not yet sufficient evidence to prove efficacy, the same treatments are suggested for youth as are recommended for adults, including nicotine replacement products. Given the severity of the tobacco epidemic worldwide and the devastating health effects on an individual and population basis, there are currently many efforts to curtail the tobacco problem, including the World Health Organization (WHO) sponsored Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It is through comprehensive and collaborative efforts such as this that the global hazard of tobacco is most likely to be overcome.","['Tobacco/Combustibles', 'Nicotine/NRT']",Missing,No,[],None/Not stated,Not coded,No,
