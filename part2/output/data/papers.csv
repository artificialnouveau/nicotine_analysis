Nicotine is widely regarded as responsible for this dependence process. It stimulates ubiquitous cholinergic receptors thus resulting mainly in catecholamine release. The causal role of nicotine in inducing and maintaining tobacco dependence is not so obvious as that of drugs responsible for other addictions.

In e-cigarettes, tobacco combustion is replaced by e-liquid heating, leading some manufacturers to propose that e-cigarettes have less harmful respiratory effects than tobacco consumption. Other innovative features such as the adjustment of nicotine content and the choice of pleasant flavours have won over many users.
